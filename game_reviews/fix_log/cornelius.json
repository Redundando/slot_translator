With a 5x4 grid and 1024 ways to win, you'll be purring with excitement as you help Cornelius catch his treats that will reward you with amazing cash prizes.</p>\n<p>If you're a high roller, you might want to consider betting the maximum of €400 per spin to increase your chances of winning big. But if you're more of a scaredy-cat, you can start with a minimum bet of €0.20 and work your way up - just like Cornelius when he's trying to catch a mouse.</p>\n<p>One great feature of Cornelius is that it has medium volatility, which means you can expect to win frequently without having to bet a small fortune. And with an RTP value of 96.04%, you can trust that this game won't leave you feeling like a sad kitty after you play.</p>\n<p>Don't want to risk any real money yet?

Conversely, if you're feeling like a high-roller, you can spin with up to €400 per round. Just remember not to spend all your money in one spin! After all, you need to keep some coins for late-night snacks and luxury cat food.</p>\n<p>The RTP value for Cornelius is 96.04%, which is about average for a slot game. But don't be fooled, Cornelius might seem pretty average at first glance, but with the perfect combination of luck, strategy, and special features, you can earn a hefty sum of coins in no time. And, if you happen to be unlucky, blame Cornelius' cat - he might have been sitting on the lucky button, so just go ahead and give him a scratch to obtain his good mojo!</p>\n<h2>Symbols and Their Values</h2>\n<p>Cornelius is a slot game that features symbols ranging from playing cards to cookies - all with their respective values!</p>\n<p>The lower value symbols are represented by playing cards from 10 to ace. The higher-paying symbols include a fish-shaped toy, a milk jar, a little box, and Cornelius himself. Cornelius is not only the highest paying symbol, but also the mascot of the game. He's a cute little rodent who's always up to something.</p>\n<p>But wait, there's more! The Scatter symbol is a jar of cookies that can land you free spins. And isn't that what we all want? More cookies, I mean, more wins! Land 3 or more of these Scatters and trigger the Free Spins bonus game!</p>\n<p>As if cookies weren't enough, there's also the Cash Drop symbol, which is represented by a plate full of tempting cookies. These symbols can pay out from 0.25 to 3 times your bet in the base game. When three Cash Drop symbols land on the reels, you're in for a treat - the Cash Drop feature is activated!</p>\n<p>To sweeten the deal and add some excitement to the game, there are other special symbols as well. The Up symbol moves Cash Drop symbols and multipliers up by one row, giving you the chance to win even bigger. The Golden Up symbol moves symbols straight to the top row for free. How cool is that? The Adder symbol increases the value of standard symbols at the end of the bonus game, and the Multiplier symbol multiplies the value of Cash Drop symbols and multipliers.</p>\n<p>In short, Cornelius is a game that celebrates all things sweet, cute and furry. With so many symbols and features, you're bound to find something that suits your taste. And if you don't, well, at least you still have cookies! </p>\n<h2>Special Game Features and Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Are you ready to cash in on some serious winnings?

Set to three and resetting every time a new Cash Drop symbol appears, it's sure to keep your excitement levels high!
