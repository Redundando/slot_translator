Ma non è finita qui, quello che rende Mega Joker una slot unica nel suo genere, è la possibilità di vedere moltiplicato l’importo della propria scommessa di addirittura 16.000 volte, quando lo Scatter compare sui rulli per cinque volte!\nAnche Mega Joker offre la possibilità di raddoppiare le proprie vincite con la funzione Gamble, e visti i moltiplicatori nel gioco regolare, si tratta di un’opportunità di vincita veramente ghiotta!\nSe si accetta di rischiare infatti, sulla schermata apparirà una carta da gioco girata della quale deve essere indovinato il colore, rosso o nero. La giusta scelta porterà al raddoppio dell’intero montepremi!\n\nConclusioni\nMega Joker è una slot in cui tradizione e innovazione si mischiano sapientemente e regalano un’esperienza di gioco davvero entusiasmante!\nLa grafica, sebbene non presenti effetti speciali o animazioni 3D, è di grande impatto, ed è amata soprattutto da chi predilige le slot machine old school.\nIl meccanismo di gioco è semplice ma personalizzabile grazie alla funzione speciale Gamble, che rende Mega Joker adatta sia a coloro che si affacciano per la prima volta nel mondo delle slot machine, sia ai giocatori più intrepidi che non hanno paura di rischiare le loro vincite col “lascia o raddoppia”.\nLa quota di distribuzione (RTP) è superiore al 95%, garanzia di vincite frequenti, inoltre i moltiplicatori così elevati permettono di mettere le mani su premi davvero consistenti anche con puntate basse.\n",
