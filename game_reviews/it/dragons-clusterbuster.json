    "text": "\nDragons Clusterbuster\nLa tana del drago\nLo sviluppatore Red Tiger ci ha da sempre abituato a giochi molto divertenti e con una grafica impeccabile. Dobbiamo dire che anche con Dragons Clusterbuster le nostre speranze non sono state disattese. Come intuibile dal titolo, la slot ha come tema i draghi, maestose creature mitologiche dotate di ali e capaci di sputare fuoco dalla bocca.\nI colori principali del gioco sono l’oro, l’argento e il rame, ma anche il blu e il verde seppur in tono minore. Ai lati della griglia c’è la pelle squamosa del drago, per il momento unico riferimento al tema del gioco.\nIn alto ci sono tre tondi con un lucchetto disegnato al centro della griglia si trova un uovo, che svolgerà una delle funzioni principali del gioco.\nMeccanismo a grappolo\nIn questa slot la meccanica di gioco a grappolo: ogni volta che atterra un cluster di almeno cinque simboli identici adiacenti si ottiene una combinazione vincente. Il sistema è a cascata, quindi i simboli vincenti scompaiono e vengono rimpiazzati da simboli del tutto nuovi che possono generare nuove combo paganti. A ogni giro atterrano quindi 72 simboli. La griglia di gioco ha forma quadrata, con nove rulli e nove righe. La scommessa minima è di 0,20 €, ma si può alzare a piacimento. Tra le funzioni principali c’è l’Autoplay e il Turbo, che permette di accelerare la caduta dei simboli.\nLa volatilità è alta, per cui non si vince spesso ma i premi sono sostanziosi.\nL’occhio del drago\nOltre alle carte da gioco, che sono i simboli che pagano meno, troviamo la pergamena, le spade, la sfera con la croce e la corona. Il simbolo Wild sostituisce tutti i simboli e può comparire in ogni posizione della griglia.\nAl centro della griglia è presente un quadrato 3×3 con all’interno un uovo. Ogni qualvolta con un unico Spin vengono rimossi i simboli intorno all’uovo, i contorni si illuminano. Rimuovendo tutti gli otto simboli, nell’uovo apparirà un occhio e verrà sbloccata la funziona corrispondente. La prima è l’occhio azzurro. In questo caso i simboli di basso valore vengono rimossi, generando un effetto a cascata che può produrre vincite più alte.\nRimuovendo le successive otto tessere al centro, si sblocca la seconda funzione. L’occhio del drago è ora verde e in modo casuale vedremo numerosi Wild sostituire diversi simboli base.\nLa terza funzione è legata all’occhio viola. In questo caso dei fulmini colpiranno un numero casuale di simboli trasformandoli in moltiplicatori.\nL’ultima funzione è quella dei Free Spins. Sbloccando otto tessere intorno all’uovo riceveremo in omaggio dieci giri gratuiti.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomande Frequenti \nCosa vuol dire sistema a cascata?\n\nSignifica che ogni volta che otteniamo una combinazione vincente, i simboli paganti vengono rimossi e sostituiti da altri nuovo, che possono generare ulteriori combo.\n\n\n\nA quanto corrisponde il ritorno teorico al giocatore di Dragons Clusterbuster?\n\nIl valore RTP è del 96%, nella media della maggior parte dei giochi di slot!\n\n\n\nPosso giocare a Dragons Clusterbuster anche sullo smartphone?\n\nCerto, Dragons Clusterbuster è disponibile per ogni device!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
