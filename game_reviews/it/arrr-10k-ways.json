    "text": "\nARRR! 10K Ways\nUn’ottima grafica\nSolitamente con l’avvicinarsi della bella stagione aumenta la voglia di giocare con slot fresche, divertenti e possibilmente che si svolgano al mare. Questo discorso vale ancor di più per i giochi a tema pirati, perché quasi sempre l’ambientazione è un mare caraibico dalle acque cristalline. ARRR! 10K Ways non sfugge a questa regola. Ci troviamo sulla spiaggia di un’isola deserta lambita dal mare chiaro, con una montagna misteriosa sullo sfondo e palme verdi da cui pendono grossi frutti esotici. La schermata è ridotta all’osso: la griglia di gioco incorniciata nel legno si trova al centro e sulla destra c’è un solo grande tasto, quello Play che dà avvio al gioco. Per tutte le altre funzioni e impostazioni, dal variatore di scommessa all’attivazione dell’Autoplay, dobbiamo accedere al menù e navigare al suo interno. In questo modo la gran parte dello schermo è destinata alla griglia, portando vantaggi in termini di chiarezza.\nAnche il comparto sonoro è sicuramente azzeccato, con il classico motivetto incalzante tipico dei film stile Pirati dei Caraibi.\n \nCaratteristiche di ARRR! 10K Ways\nLa griglia di gioco è leggermente più grande del solito, con 6 rulli e 3 righe, oltre a una bobina orizzontale posizionata in alto. I modi per vincere sono 10.000, con una vincita massima pari a 20.000 volte la puntata. La scommessa minima è di 0,20 €, ma può essere alzata sino a 25 €. Tra le impostazioni troviamo quello per spostare il tasto Play sulla sinistra, utile per i mancini, e l’Autoplay, con cui avviare i giri automatici.\nLa volatilità è bassa, con pagamenti frequenti ma senza elargire cifre da capogiro, mentre il ritorno teorico al giocatore (RTP) è del 96,12%.\n \nCome si vince a ARRR! 10K Ways?\nQuesta slot sfrutta il meccanismo a cascata, per cui i simboli interessati in una combo vincente vengono rimossi e gli altri scivolano di posizione riempendo gli spazi lasciati vuoti.\nI simboli sono vari e con molte differenze in termini di valore: a pagare meno sono i semi delle carte da gioco, seguiti dal Kraken, dal pappagallo e dalla piratessa. Il pirata è il simbolo più remunerativo, arriva a pagare sino a 50 volte la scommessa e il minimo di simboli richiesto per creare una combo è 2 anziché 3.\nIl tipico stemma Jolly Roberts è il Wild e sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter.\nTra i Bonus troviamo il Cannon Wilds che si attiva casualmente dopo un giro perdente. Colpi di cannone trasformeranno da 1 a 3 simboli regolari in Wild a cui è associato anche un moltiplicatore compreso tra 1x e 5x.\nLo Scatter è rappresentato dal forziere e quando sui rulli ne atterrano almeno 4, vengono assegnati 3 Respins in cui compariranno solo i simboli forziere, kraken e capitano.\nA seguito del gioco bonus, ci verrà offerta la possibilità di incrementare le nostre vincite grazie alla funzione Gamble, con il rischio concreto però di perdere tutto.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nPosso giocare a ARRR! 10K Ways anche sul tablet?\n\nSì, perché questa slot è dotata di architettura HTML5 che le permette di girare su tutti i dispositivi mobili.\n\n\n\nQual è la vincita massima?\n\nIn ARRR! 10K Ways si può vincere una somma pari a 20.000 volte la scommessa iniziale.\n\n\n\nCome posso ottenere i Respins?\n\nCi sono 2 strade, la prima è sperare di ottenere almeno 4 forzieri, la seconda è acquistare la funzione attraverso il tasto Buy che si trova alla sinistra della griglia.\n\n\n\n",

We find ourselves on the beach of a deserted island kissed by the clear sea, with a mysterious mountain in the background and green palms from which large exotic fruits hang.

In this way, most of the screen is dedicated to the grid, bringing advantages in terms of clarity.\nThe sound department is also certainly successful, with the classic catchy tune typical of Pirates of the Caribbean-style films.\n\nFeatures of ARRR! 10K Ways\nThe game grid is slightly larger than usual, with 6 reels and 3 rows, plus a horizontal reel positioned at the top. There are 10,000 ways to win, with a maximum win of 20,000 times the bet. The minimum bet is €0.20, but it can be raised up to €25. Among the settings, we find the one to move the Play button to the left, useful for left-handed people, and Autoplay, to start automatic spins.\nThe volatility is low, with frequent payouts but without giving dizzying sums, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.12%.\n\nHow to win at ARRR! 10K Ways?\nThis slot uses the cascade mechanism, so the symbols involved in a winning combo are removed and the others slide into position, filling the empty spaces.\nThe symbols are varied and with many differences in terms of value: the lowest paying are card game suits, followed by the Kraken, parrot and pirate princess. The pirate is the most rewarding symbol, paying up to 50 times the bet and the minimum number of symbols required to create a combo is 2 instead of 3.\nThe typical Jolly Roberts emblem is the Wild and replaces all symbols except the Scatter.\nAmong the bonuses, we find the Cannon Wilds, which are randomly activated after a losing spin. Cannon shots will transform 1 to 3 regular symbols into Wilds, which are also associated with a multiplier ranging from 1x to 5x.\nThe Scatter is represented by the chest and when at least 4 land on the reels, 3 Respins are awarded in which only chest, Kraken and captain symbols appear.\nFollowing the bonus game, we will be offered the opportunity to increase our winnings thanks to the Gamble function, but with the concrete risk of losing everything.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I play ARRR! 10K Ways on a tablet?\n\nYes, because this slot is equipped with HTML5 architecture that allows it to run on all mobile devices.\n\nWhat is the maximum win?\n\nIn ARRR! 10K Ways, you can win a sum equal to 20,000 times the initial bet.\n\nHow can I get Respins?\n\nThere are 2 ways, the first is to hope to get at least 4 chests, the second is to buy the feature through the Buy button located to the left of the grid."
