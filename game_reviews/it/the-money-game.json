    "text": "\nThe Money Game\nSi gioca alle slot per divertimento, questo è vero, ma sempre con un occhio verso un possibile profitto in denaro: The Money Game, slot machine prodotta dalla software house Novomatic, ci ricorda proprio questo con il suo tema, che va bene l’aspetto ludico ma se si vince è meglio!\nThe Money Game appare come una slot machine molto vintage per quanto riguarda il compartimento grafico, con uno sfondo verde-dollaro e delle icone rappresentate in maniera molto semplice, quasi stilizzate, ma comunque efficace.\nLe slot di casa Novomatic del resto, si contraddistinguono sempre per la loro qualità grafica, oltre che per la solidità dei software e i buoni pagamenti, e anche The Money Game nonostante sia così semplice, si rivela poi un gioco estremamente valido e interessante.\nL’attenzione con The Money Game risulta sempre concentrata sul gioco, e non si hanno animazioni tridimensionali o effetti speciali a distrarvi, solo tanto verde e tanto denaro in tutte le sue forme: borsellini, sacchi e cumuli di monete vi ricorderanno in ogni momento cosa e perché state giocando!\nQuesta slot machine potrebbe essere l’ideale per tutti quei giocatori che non amano le slot elaborate ma puntano dritti al sodo e che, come vedremo a breve, da questo punto di vista saranno ampiamente ripagati.\n\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nLa struttura di The Money Game è di quelle semplici e tradizionali: cinque canonici rulli, tre righe e sole nove linee di pagamento sulle quali si possono scommettere importi che vanno da 0,1 fino a 900 crediti, per soddisfare anche i giocatori più agguerriti!\nLa vincita più alta che si può ottenere con questa slot machine ricompenserà la pazienza nel gioco: il jackpot è infatti pari a 9.000 volte il valore della vostra puntata, proprio niente male!\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP) è invece una nota un pochino stonata di The Money Game, che con uno scarsissimo 94,6% risulta poco soddisfacente.\nNel complesso, vi consigliamo questa slot machine se non amate distrazioni nel gioco o se volete avere la possibilità di giocare sia importi molto piccoli che molto alti; inoltre in virtù del gameplay assai facile, The Money Game  potrebbe essere interessante anche per coloro che si affacciano per la prima volta nel mondo delle slot machine.\n\nSimboli e funzionalità speciali di The Money Game\nI simboli che si alternano sui rulli di The Money Game sono distinti in tematici e non tematici, ma tutti sono rappresentati con icone graficamente molto semplici.\nI numeri e le lettere che corrispondono alle carte da gioco dal 9 all’Asso sono i simboli che pagano di meno, offrendo vincite fino a 250 volte il valore della puntata.\nPer ottenere dei premi più sostanziosi bisogna puntare ai simboli tematici: il portafoglio, il sacco e i mazzetti di banconote e infine il banchiere, che paga il jackpot di 9.000 volte la puntata.\nÈ presente uno Scatter, il simbolo del dollaro, che permette di accedere ai giri gratuiti ed è possibile tentare ulteriormente la fortuna dopo una vincita di qualsiasi importo grazie alla funzione Gamble, con la quale potrete provare a raddoppiare il vostro premio indovinando il colore di una carta da gioco.\n",
