    "text": "\nWhite Tiger: Sky Gods\nUna macchinetta molto affascinante a livello di design, con un gameplay abbastanza lineare e semplice, che è caratterizzato da cinque rulli per tre file e ben 50 linee di pagamento. La slot White Tiger: Sky Gods  di Light & Wonder riesce con semplicità a proporre una soluzione di gioco molto ambiziosa all’interno dei casinò online.\nLa prima cosa che notiamo è sicuramente la sua ambientazione, sufficientemente originale da non renderla una slot banale, pur raccontando il fascino di un animale che è un vero simbolo per l’Asia. Entriamo nel vivo di questa slot con un RTP al 96,05%.\nGrafica della slot White Tiger: Sky Gods\nCome abbiamo avuto modo di dire questa slot punta molto sulla bellezza estetica non solo della sua struttura ma anche dei simboli scelti per raccontare questa storia. Nel complesso troviamo 11 simboli di pagamento suddivisi tra 6 simboli a basso costo e 5 ad alto valore. Possiamo così ammirare la lanterna, i pesci koi, l’immancabile presenza del drago (simbolo indiscusso della cultura asiatica) e le monete d’oro. Non a caso la testa del drago offre una ricompensa più alta pari a 10 volte la scommessa qualora si possa trovare una combinazione di cinque simboli.\nNon dimentichiamo poi i tre simboli speciali del gioco che sono Wild e Scatter (2). Il primo va a sostituire qualsiasi simbolo di gioco, e può apparire solo nei rulli centrali. Sono invece due i simboli Scatter che permettono di attivare le funzionalità bonus della slot.\nCaratteristiche di gioco e funzioni\nCon 3 o più White Scatter si attiva la funzione Pick n Play: in questo caso bisogna scegliere tra i giri gratuiti una funzione di gioco. Nel primo caso si ricevono 10 free spin con Wild aggiuntivi. La funzione Sky Gods invece si compone di 3 fasi separate: nella prima fase, devi far atterrare quanti più simboli possibile durante i respins.\nNella seconda puoi ottenere vari bonus e sbloccare la fase finale, che prevede di ottenere non solo moltiplicatori di vincita, ma anche 3 jackpot progressivi.\nConsiderazioni finali\nPer riassumere la slot White Tiger, possiamo dire che si fa apprezzare per l’ambientazione originale, le funzionalità di gioco e la sua grande semplicità. È infatti priva di fronzoli e permette di poter apprezzare ogni giro per l’alto livello di sicurezza e pulizia del gioco.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nL’RTP della White Tiger: Sky Gods slot è basso?\n\nNo, il ritorno al giocatore è positivo e nella media di riferimento per il settore delle slot online.\n\n\n\nPosso giocare alla slot White Tiger: Sky Gods gratis?\n\nCerto, puoi trovare online la versione For fun nei casinò oppure ti basta usare la demo che trovi nel nostro sito.\n\n\n\nQuali sono i punti di forza della slot White Tiger: Sky Gods?\n\nHa un tema originale, 3 jackpot progressivi e la sua funzionalità Sky Gods è sicuramente molto interessante.\n\n\n\n",
