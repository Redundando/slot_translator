    "text": "\nCleopatra\nI temi egiziani sono un must have per i fornitori di slot machine e IGT non fa eccezione.   Che cosa ha di speciale Cleopatra, la slot gratis e senza registrazione oltre ad una  ambientazione nell’Antico Egitto? Scopriamolo insieme in questa recensione che ti farà scoprire nuovi trucchi per vincere le migliori combinazioni vincenti.\n\nCleopatra: la regina dell’Egitto\nCleopatra è una slot tradizionale sviluppata dal colosso di iGaming IGT. Si tratta di una delle slot più popolari di tutti i tempi a tema egiziano. Possiede 5 rulli e 20 linee di pagamento, oltre un RTP che supera il 92%. Può essere giocata puntando da 0,10€ fino ad un massimo di 10,00€ a giro sia su dispositivi desktop che su tablet e dispositivi mobili. Rilasciata alcuni anni fa, la grafica e le animazioni ti sembreranno un po’ datate ma in realtà aggiungono quel tocco di vintage al gioco.\n\nI principali simboli vincenti\nNon appena comincia la partita ti ritroverai sullo sfondo dello schermo un antico tempio egizio e i rulli tempestati da preziose icone in stile egiziano oltre ai simboli classici:\n\nCleopatra è il simbolo Jolly e sostituisce tutte le icone ad esclusione della Sfinge,\nLo Scarabeo è il simbolo più gratificante e fortunato di questa slot online. Se ne appaiono 5 su una linea di pagamento ti faranno vincere 37,5 volte la puntata,\nCartigli (tavolette scolpite) ,\nFiori di loto,\nA, K, Q, J, 10 e 9 reali.\n\nImportante! Quando ottieni una combinazione vincente che coinvolge 1 o più jolly, il tuo pagamento viene raddoppiato. Se sei super fortunato e riesci a ottenere 5 jolly su una linea di pagamento, intascherai 500 volte la puntata.\n\nBonus e altre funzionalità speciali\nNella slot online di IGT tutto ruota intorno alla figura di Cleopatra e al suo bonus, chiamato Cleopatra Bonus, che ti farà vincere fino a 180 giri gratis con un fantastico moltiplicatore 3x. Questa funzione viene giocata quando ottieni 3, 4 o 5 simboli Sphinx Scatter in qualsiasi posizione sui rulli, con una ricompensa che sarà 5, 20 o 100 volte la tua puntata + 15 giri gratuiti. L’unico caso in cui ciò non si può applicare questa opzione è se ottieni 5 jolly Cleopatra su una payline. Se dovessi ottenere 4 scarabei e una combinazione Wild, porterai a casa una doppia vittoria una da Cleopatra e una dal moltiplicatore 3x che ti regalerà un moltiplicatore 6x.\n\nPerché scegliere la slot online Cleopatra\nIl gioco ci ha convinti, la grafica anche se datata è curata nei minimi dettagli, con icone ben disegnate. Il sottofondo musicale è coinvolgente e ti sembra di vivere un’avventura realistica accanto alla regale Cleopatra. Puoi anche disattivare la colonna sonora e concentrarti sulla partita sia in modalità demo che con soldi reali, se sei alla ricerca di bonus di benvenuto e di promozioni speciali degni di una re!\n",
