    "original_text": "\nDungeon Quest\nIspirato dai popolarissimi Dungeons and Dragons, ma fortunatamente non ci sono draghi da combattere in questa Dungeon Quest attraverso le miniere di nani abbandonate per scoprire il tesoro sepolto al loro interno. Unisciti ai nostri quattro coraggiosi personaggi – un mago saggio, un feroce guerriero, un forte vichingo e un elfo magico mentre intraprendono una ricerca di re, avventurandosi nell’ignoto per le ricchezze e la fama che li attendono all’interno. Prendendo una forma un po’ insolita, Dragon Quest di NoLimit City contiene una disposizione di slot di 5 rulli e 7 linee, offrendo una massiccia vincita di 29 linee di pagamento e di entrambe le vie, quindi c’è un sacco di opportunità per scoprire le ricchezze segrete dei nani in questo dungeon.\nUna grafica fantasy\nAnche se i nostri impavidi leader non sono simboli in questo gioco, il mago, il guerriero, il vichingo e l’elfo possono essere visti nelle loro posizioni di battaglia alla sinistra dei rulli, vegliando su ogni tuo giro.\nI simboli stessi sono fatti di gemme preziose e minerali magici che sono pronti a trasformarsi in gemme in qualsiasi momento.\nAnche se Dungeons and Dragons potrebbe non essere il gioco da tavolo più semplice da padroneggiare, la natura spogliata di Dungeon Quest lo rende perfetto sia per i giocatori vecchi che per quelli nuovi per sedersi e godersi l’Azione e l’Avventura Slot NoLimit City ha progettato.\nLa grafica di questo gioco è semplice e simile a quella dei cartoni animati, con le gemme che mi ricordano altri giochi classici come Bejewelled, rendendo impossibile non cercare le partite in ogni giro. La qualità impilata dei simboli e la musica avventurosa aggiunge anche un tocco arcade al gioco.\nAnche se alcuni giocatori e designer preferiscono effetti 3D appariscenti nelle loro slot, Dungeon Quest mantiene le cose semplici con un layout pulito e una grafica piacevole che si può facilmente guardare girare tutto il giorno.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nPer far girare i rulli, basta cliccare sul grande pulsante a destra dei rulli che contiene una freccia che si insegue da sola. Oppure, se preferite, impostate la funzione di spin automatico per far girare il gioco per vostro conto un certo numero di volte, cliccando sul pulsante più piccolo “play” nell’angolo in basso a destra dello schermo. In questa schermata potete anche impostare i limiti di vincita e di perdita, oltre a stabilire il numero di giri automatici che desiderate effettuare.\nAccanto al pulsante autoplay vedrete un fulmine. Questo velocizza i già abbastanza veloci rocchetti per coloro che non vedono l’ora di vedere i risultati del loro prossimo testacoda.\nSpostandovi a sinistra di questi pulsanti, lungo la parte inferiore dello schermo, potrete visualizzare il vostro equilibrio seguito dalla puntata totale per giro. Potete modificare la vostra scommessa cliccando sulla parola ‘scommessa’ e scegliere di scommettere in qualsiasi punto tra 0,20€ e 100 € per giro se vi sentite a filo; perfetto per i giocatori di penny o per i giocatori di alto livello grazie al generoso spread di scommessa disponibile.\nInoltre, attivata in modo casuale durante il gioco di base, questa funzione bonus prevede l’assistenza di uno dei quattro personaggi principali del gioco che prende vita e trasforma magicamente uno dei colori del minerale nella loro forma di gemma preziosa. Grazie alla natura impilata dei simboli di Dungeon Quest, questo può fornire vincite incredibilmente lucrative attraverso i rulli, con le possibilità di colpire le linee di pagamento corrispondenti drammaticamente aumentate.\nGrazie alle 29 linee di pagamento e al sistema di vincita di entrambi i canali, trovare quelle gemme nascoste nelle miniere è facile. Basta abbinare tre o più simboli lungo una linea di pagamento partendo dall’estrema sinistra o dall’estrema destra del mulinello per raccogliere i premi.\nTenete d’occhio i bonus aggiuntivi che trasformano i minerali grezzi in gemme di potenza per ottenere quelle vincite più lucrative.\nSecondo NoLimit City, il primo premio disponibile in Dungeon Quest è 450x la tua scommessa totale, quindi ci sono alcuni premi abbastanza buoni a disposizione se sei abbastanza coraggioso da affrontare la missione.\nDungeon Quest offre un rapporto RTP (Return to Player) abbastanza standard del 96,27%, il che significa che per ogni 100 euro scommesse il gioco pagherà circa 96,27 euro.\nLa funzione Power Stone può essere attivata in qualsiasi momento durante il gioco quando le mine si muovono come se ci fosse un terremoto. Questo scuotimento fa sì che la Power Stone si schianti sui rulli, trasformando l’area 2×2 su cui atterra in simboli selvaggi. Il rinculo di questo crollo trasforma anche i simboli dei minerali corrispondenti in simboli selvaggi, dandovi un sacco di opportunità per un ‘campo minato’ di vincite.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nSe vi piace Dungeon Quest, amerete Temple Of Treasures Megaway.\nAvventuratevi nelle profondità di un’antica giungla azteca per entrare nel tempio e cercare le ricchezze sepolte al suo interno, in questo gioco di slot megaway di Blueprint. Con 6 rulli e 117.649 modi possibili di vincere, questo gioco offre alcuni premi enormemente lucrosi a chi ha il coraggio di cercarli.\n",

Yet fear not my fellow gamblers, there are no dragons to be fought in this quest! Our four courageous characters - a wise wizard, a fierce warrior, a mighty viking and a magical elf - embark on a journey to discover the treasures hidden within abandoned dwarf mines. With a unique layout of 5 reels and 7 lines, this game offers a massive 29 pay lines and pays both ways, providing plenty of opportunities to discover the secret riches of the dwarves in this dungeon. \n\nThe graphics in this game are simple yet enchanting with its cartoonish gemstone symbols, akin to other classic games like Bejeweled. The quality of the symbols stacked and the adventurous music add an arcade-like touch. Although some may prefer flashy 3D effects, Dungeon Quest keeps things crisp and clean with a pleasing graphic design that you can watch spin for hours. \n\nTo spin the reels, just click the big button on the right that contains an arrow (or the smaller autoplay button in the lower right corner). By setting the auto-spin function, you can let the game run on your behalf a certain number of times. Along the bottom of the screen, you can see your balance followed by your total bet per spin. Simply modify your bet by clicking on the word “bet”. You can choose to bet anywhere from 0.20€ to 100 € per spin, making it perfect for both penny players and high rollers alike. \n\nBe on the lookout for bonus features that turn raw minerals into power gems, providing more opportunities for lucrative wins. The randomly activated Power Stone feature can be triggered at any time during the base game when the mine shakes like an earthquake. This shaking causes the Power Stone to crash onto the reels, transforming the 2x2 area it lands on into wild symbols. The recoil from this crash also turns corresponding mineral symbols into wilds, providing plenty of opportunities for a minefield of wins! \n\nDungeon Quest offers a reasonably standard RTP (Return to Player) of 96.27%, meaning that for every 100 euros bet in the game, it will pay around 96.27 euros. And, if you enjoy Dungeon Quest, you will love Temple Of Treasures Megaway. Venture into the depths of an ancient Aztec jungle to enter the temple and search for the buried treasure inside this Megaways slot game. With 6 reels and 117,649 possible ways to win, this game offers enormous prizes to those brave enough to seek them.\n            ",

Yet fear not my fellow gamblers, there are no dragons to be fought in this quest! Our four courageous characters - a wise wizard, a fierce warrior, a mighty viking and a magical elf - embark on a journey to discover the treasures hidden within abandoned dwarf mines. With a unique layout of 5 reels and 7 lines, this game offers a massive 29 pay lines and pays both ways, providing plenty of opportunities to discover the secret riches of the dwarves in this dungeon. \n\nThe graphics in this game are simple yet enchanting with its cartoonish gemstone symbols, akin to other classic games like Bejeweled. The quality of the symbols stacked and the adventurous music add an arcade-like touch. Although some may prefer flashy 3D effects, Dungeon Quest keeps things crisp and clean with a pleasing graphic design that you can watch spin for hours. \n\nTo spin the reels, just click the big button on the right that contains an arrow (or the smaller autoplay button in the lower right corner). By setting the auto-spin function, you can let the game run on your behalf a certain number of times. Along the bottom of the screen, you can see your balance followed by your total bet per spin. Simply modify your bet by clicking on the word “bet”. You can choose to bet anywhere from 0.20€ to 100 € per spin, making it perfect for both penny players and high rollers alike. \n\nBe on the lookout for bonus features that turn raw minerals into power gems, providing more opportunities for lucrative wins. The randomly activated Power Stone feature can be triggered at any time during the base game when the mine shakes like an earthquake. This shaking causes the Power Stone to crash onto the reels, transforming the 2x2 area it lands on into wild symbols. The recoil from this crash also turns corresponding mineral symbols into wilds, providing plenty of opportunities for a minefield of wins! \n\nDungeon Quest offers a reasonably standard RTP (Return to Player) of 96.27%, meaning that for every 100 euros bet in the game, it will pay around 96.27 euros. And, if you enjoy Dungeon Quest, you will love Temple Of Treasures Megaway. Venture into the depths of an ancient Aztec jungle to enter the temple and search for the buried treasure inside this Megaways slot game. With 6 reels and 117,649 possible ways to win, this game offers enormous prizes to those brave enough to seek them.\n            ",
