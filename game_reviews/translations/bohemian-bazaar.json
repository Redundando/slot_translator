The slot's background is a festive city square with buildings and a flower-covered wooden scaffolding enclosing the game grid. \n\nBonus game\n\nBohemian Bazaar offers a bonus game that can be reactivated. The game's payout table can be accessed from the settings menu to provide a detailed estimate of symbol values. Players can trigger the game by landing the Scatter symbol, which is the caravan icon, on reels 2, 3, and 4. If 3 Scatters land, they will be rewarded with 15 Free Spins. \n\nWild and Scatter symbols\n\nBohemian Bazaar has two special symbols: Wild and Scatter. The four cards for fortune-telling represent the Wild icon, acting as the Joker and replacing all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter symbol is the caravan icon, and if players land three Scatters on reels 2, 3, and 4, they can trigger the Bonus game. \n\nSoundtrack and atmosphere\n\nBohemian Bazaar has a cheerful soundtrack that fits the festive atmosphere, which is inspired by the nomadic gypsy culture. Players can control the volume or turn off the sound from the settings menu. The slot's background and symbols immerse players in the gypsy world, using flashy women's clothing, carriages, and long-haired men wearing vests. \n\n        \n            ",

Symbols used in this slot game are highly recognizable, such as women dressed in flashy clothes with an ornament on their heads, men with long hair and wearing vests, and carriages used for transportation. There are 3 low-level and 4 high-level symbols, including playing cards, which have a low value, and gypsies, which have higher values. The two special symbols are a Wild and a Scatter.

Bohemian Bazaar celebrates this culture by using highly recognizable symbols, such as women dressed in flashy clothes with an ornament on their heads, men with long hair and wearing vests, and carriages used for transportation.\nThe main screen opens up onto the square of a festive city, with the flags running from one wall to another of the stately buildings and the game grid enclosed in a wooden scaffolding wrapped in flowers.\nThe Start, Autoplay, and Turbo buttons are on the right-hand side, while at the bottom, there is the bet meter and the statistics on the gameplay that allow us to keep an eye on wins and losses.\nThe music is cheerful and not intrusive, but it can be easily turned off at any time from the settings.\nBohemian Bazaar features\nThe gameplay system is a cascade, which means that after every winning combination, the winning symbols disappear and those at the top fall down, creating new opportunities for victory.\nThe 243 ways to win are on a 5-reel and 3-row grid, with the minimum cost of each Spin being €0.50.\nWith Autoplay, you can activate from 10 to 100 automatic spins, but there is an obligation to set win and loss limits to avoid going overboard. The Turbo button is very useful, speeding up the falling symbols.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96%.\nSymbols and Bonus\nHigh 5 Games has decided to use few symbols, 3 low-level and 4 high-level. In this review, we will only illustrate them without reporting their exact value. To have a detailed estimate of the rewards, we recommend accessing the Payment table through the menu.\nThe Q, K and A playing cards have a low value, while the numbers increase significantly with the 4 gypsies. The special symbols are two, Wild and Scatter. The Wild, represented by 4 cards for fortune-telling, covers the classic function of the Joker and replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is the icon of the caravan and can only appear on reels 2, 3 and 4. If 3 land, they reward with 15 Free Spins.\nThe Bonus function can be reactivated.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nBohemian Bazaar has a theoretical return to player or RTP of 96%.\n\nCan I try the slot before playing with real money?\n\nOn our website, there is a DEMO version that allows playing in FREE mode for as long as desired.\n\nHow many ways to win are there in Bohemian Bazaar?\n\nThis slot has 243 ways to win.\n        ",
