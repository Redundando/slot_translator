Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nOverview of the slot game\nGameplay and features\nWinning potential and payouts\nDesign and graphics\nSound and music\nTheme of the game\nTarget audience and recommendation\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Deep in the ocean lurks the Kraken, an ancient octopus-like creature that waits to drag ships and sailors under. Beat The Beast: Kraken's Lair is a five-reel, nine-payline online slot game from Thunderkick. The Kraken guards the depths of the ocean, and your task is to try and defeat this legendary monster of Norse mythology. This slot game looks promising, so let's see what it has to offer.\n\nAn enormous sea monster is the star of the Beat the Beast: Kraken's Lair online slot game. It is one of Thunderkick's Beat the Beast series of games, all of which share high volatility gameplay and exciting features.\n\nUnleash the Kraken across the five reels and nine paylines to activate an expanding symbol mechanism and free games with guaranteed wild symbols in view. The creature is also the Wild symbol of Beat the Beast: Kraken's Lair. With the optimal combination of symbols, you can win 7,777x your total bet.\n\nMonstrous Graphics\nBeat The Beast: Kraken's Lair has a Norse mythological theme and focuses on defeating the Kraken. You are taken deep into the ocean to beat this beast, where you will see sunken ships. There, the graphics are stunning and of high quality. The symbols in this game include Poker cards (from Ace to 10), a Kraken, the Kraken idol, the golden Kraken, the medallion, and the trident.\n\nEvocative music spreads as the reels spin, adding to the feeling that you are about to face a monster feared by sailors since ancient times. The reels are located within a heavy metal effect frame, decorated in Viking style, with a metal support for each symbolic position. Sunken ships litter the deep background of Beat the Beast: Kraken's Lair.\n\nThe card icons in bronze, silver, and gold style return smaller prizes, with more significant payouts coming from slightly comic book-style symbols like a trident, a pendant, a treasure chest, and a golden Kraken statue. The monster itself is a purple and blue creature that emerges from the reels. It is a classic underwater-themed slot game.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nYour adventure in the ocean will begin when you click on the spin button located in the right corner of the game. Next to the spin button is the autoplay button that allows you to set how many game turns you want to play automatically.\n\nOf course, before doing this, you need to place a bet ranging from 0.01 euros to 100 euros per spin. To view further information on this slot game, select the \"book\" button located in the lower left corner, or select the \"trophy\" button below it to find the paytable.\n\nIn the Beat The Beast: Kraken's Lair slot, winning combinations are formed by landing two or more symbols (three in the case of cards) from left to right. Additionally, the gold Kraken wild/scatter symbol helps you win by replacing all symbols. If you land five such symbols, the game will pay you 500x your bet.\n\nFree spins are triggered when you land at least three of the Kraken wild/scatter symbols anywhere on the reel set. Three, four, or five scatters will also give you a payout of 2, 20, or 200 times your bet. During each free spin, at least one Kraken is randomly added to the reels, increasing your chances of receiving more prizes and more free spins.\n\nThe Expanding Wild Feature is activated when you get a winning combination that includes a Kraken wild/scatter symbol. Then, one of the regular symbols that allows you to make your bet successful will expand and fill the entire reel. A new win will then be calculated, and this can help you increase your winnings.\n\nWhen it comes to the jackpot on Beat The Beast: Kraken's Lair, there is no progressive or fixed jackpot, but you can still win huge prizes from the depths of the ocean. This is because this game comes with a maximum win of 7,777x your bet, which is a big number. If you play with the highest bet of 100 euros, you can win up to 7777,700 euros per spin.\n\nConsidering everything that has been said above, we can say that this game is really fantastic. In terms of gameplay, it is simple and easy. However, it is a high variance game that has many winning opportunities. If you are lucky enough, you will win 7,777x your bet per spin or during free spins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nTry the Slot Machine on the great Egyptian Sphinx we are about to talk to you about and answer the three questions to ensure a safe passage to the afterlife.

The symbols in this game include Poker cards (from Ace to 10), a Kraken, the Kraken idol, the golden Kraken, the medallion, and the trident.\n\nEvocative music spreads as the reels spin, adding to the feeling that you are about to face a monster feared by sailors since ancient times. The reels are located within a heavy metal effect frame, decorated in Viking style, with a metal support for each symbolic position. Sunken ships litter the deep background of Beat the Beast: Kraken's Lair.\n\nThe card icons in bronze, silver, and gold style return smaller prizes, with more significant payouts coming from slightly comic book-style symbols like a trident, a pendant, a treasure chest, and a golden Kraken statue.

If you land five such symbols, the game will pay you 500x your bet.\n\nFree spins are triggered when you land at least three of the Kraken wild/scatter symbols anywhere on the reel set. Three, four, or five scatters will also give you a payout of 2, 20, or 200 times your bet. During each free spin, at least one Kraken is randomly added to the reels, increasing your chances of receiving more prizes and more free spins.\n\nThe Expanding Wild Feature is activated when you get a winning combination that includes a Kraken wild/scatter symbol. Then, one of the regular symbols that allows you to make your bet successful will expand and fill the entire reel. A new win will then be calculated, and this can help you increase your winnings.\n\nWhen it comes to the jackpot on Beat The Beast: Kraken's Lair, there is no progressive or fixed jackpot, but you can still win huge prizes from the depths of the ocean. This is because this game comes with a maximum win of 7,777x your bet, which is a big number.

The image should feature a happy Maya warrior with glasses who appears to be defeating the Kraken in a playful manner. The Maya warrior should be depicted in a vibrant and colorful style, with exaggerated features and a confident expression. The Kraken should be shown as a large and menacing sea monster with huge tentacles reaching out to grab the Maya warrior. The background of the image should be a sunken shipwreck in the ocean, with bubbles and seaweed adding to the overall underwater theme. The image should be eye-catching and playful, inviting players to join the adventure and battle the Kraken."
