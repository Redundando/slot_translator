Con Eight Immortals, la Dreamtech ci fa viaggiare tra la mitologia cinese, prendendo spunto dalla leggenda degli otto immortali, utilizzatissimi nell’arte e nella letteratura cinese.

Dal punto di vista grafico infatti, la Dreamtech ha creato una slot impeccabile e decisamente accattivante, specialmente per chi ama l’animazione e i videogiochi giapponesi, ma andiamo con ordine. Lo sfondo, molto semplice seppur animato, è composto da delle onde che si infrangono sugli scogli, con una creatura leggendaria simile ad una manta che salta occasionalmente fuori dall’acqua. La griglia, composta da 5 rulli a 3 linee è trasparente, mentre in alto e in basso sullo schermo ci sono i dati di gioco, incorniciati con un motivo dallo stile orientale. La semplicità dello sfondo e funzionale per non affaticare troppo l’occhio del giocatore e per non creare una scena troppo confusionaria, questo perché ad essere molto più dettagliati sono i simboli di gioco. Ognuno di questi, tranne quello con una semplice tavola e alcune monete d’oro, è caratterizzato da un personaggio degli otto immortali, che verrà anche animato nel caso si vincesse un jackpot. Lo stile in cui sono disegnati i personaggi è molto accattivante e reminescente dello stile degli anime giapponesi. Il simbolo Wild è una lettera dorata mentre lo scatter un tempio tra delle nuvole. Quando si ottengono spin gratuite grazie agli scatter (ne parleremo meglio nel prossimo paragrafo), lo sfondo cambia e veniamo trasportati in un mistico panorama montuoso, tra le nuvole e gli aironi.

Con un RTP abbastanza generoso del 97.01% e un rullo orizzontale presente sulla parte superiore della griglia che potrebbe permettervi di ottenere dei moltiplicatori ad ogni giocata, Eight Immortals è una scelta valida anche per chi non verrà ammaliato abbastanza dal suo comparto artistico.\nSlot simili a Eight Immortals\nSe dopo aver provato Eight Immortals avrete ancora fame di cultura orientale potreste provare 88 Fortunes, Asian Beauty, Choy Sun Doa o, se siete amanti dei carlini, anche il bizzarro Astro Pug.\n",

And today's game, Eight Immortals, takes us on a journey through Chinese mythology, inspired by the legend of the eight immortals. The Dreamtech did justice to this legendary tale with an impeccable and captivating slot. The graphics are top-notch, with a simple yet animated background of waves crashing against rocks, and a legendary creature resembling a manta occasionally jumping out of the water. The game grid is transparent, with five reels and three lines, while the game's data is framed with an oriental motif.  The game's detailed symbols are the true highlights, each characterized by a character of the eight immortals, drawn in a stunning anime style. The golden letter is the wild symbol, while the scatter is a temple among clouds. Winning free spins with scatters is a feast for the eyes, transporting you to a mystical mountainous landscape with clouds and herons. The music is equally impressive, featuring oriental sounds mixed with modern and energetic rhythms that will get your blood pumping in intense moments.\n\nThe gameplay of Eight Immortals may be simple, but it has a generous RTP of 97.01% and a horizontal reel above the grid that could provide you with multipliers on every spin. The only special feature is the 15 free spins activated by landing three or more scatters. But for those looking for a visually stunning game with decent rewards, Eight Immortals is a solid choice. If you still crave more oriental-themed slots after playing Eight Immortals, you could try your luck with 88 Fortunes, Asian Beauty, Choy Sun Doa, or even the quirky Astro Pug if you're a fan of dogs.",

Ancient villages, warriors, and the inevitable Chinese New Year have provided the backdrop for many interesting slots, and today's game is no exception. With Eight Immortals, Dreamtech takes us on a journey through Chinese mythology, drawing inspiration from the legend of the eight immortals, widely used in Chinese art and literature. Has Dreamtech managed to create a noteworthy slot machine or have they simply exploited these legendary figures? Let's find out by analyzing the graphics first.\n\nEight Immortals and its interesting characters\nSince the legend of the eight immortals is so famous, Eight Immortals is certainly not the only slot machine that takes inspiration from it, but it is definitely the one that does them the most honor. From a graphic standpoint, Dreamtech has created an impeccable and decidedly captivating slot, especially for those who love animation and Japanese video games. The background, although simple, is animated and consists of waves breaking on rocks, with a legendary creature similar to a manta occasionally jumping out of the water. The grid, consisting of 5 reels and 3 lines, is transparent, while the game data is displayed at the top and bottom of the screen framed in an oriental-style motif. The simplicity of the background is functional so as not to strain the player's eye too much and not create a confusing scene. The game symbols are much more detailed. Each one, except for the one with a simple table and some gold coins, is characterized by one of the eight immortal characters, which will also be animated in case you win a jackpot. The style in which the characters are drawn is very appealing and reminiscent of Japanese anime style. The Wild symbol is a golden letter while the scatter is a temple in the clouds. When you get free spins thanks to the scatter (which we will discuss in more detail in the next paragraph), the background changes and transports you to a mystical mountain vista among the clouds and cranes. There are several music tracks, but they all reflect the oriental theme, although in some cases they also have modern and energetic sounds that can charge the player during the most intense moments.\n\nEight Immortals, simple yet effective\nWhile Eight Immortals excels in graphic style, gameplay is rather simple.

The background, although simple, is animated and consists of waves breaking on rocks, with a legendary creature similar to a manta occasionally jumping out of the water. The grid, consisting of 5 reels and 3 lines, is transparent, while the game data is displayed at the top and bottom of the screen framed in an oriental-style motif. The game symbols are much more detailed. Each one, except for the one with a simple table and some gold coins, is characterized by one of the eight immortal characters, which will also be animated in case you win a jackpot. The style in which the characters are drawn is very appealing and reminiscent of Japanese anime style.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nWhile Eight Immortals excels in graphic style, gameplay is rather simple. It does not have any particular modes except for the 15 free spins (which can be reactivated and accumulated) activated by getting at least three scatters. With a fairly generous RTP of 97.01% and a horizontal reel at the top of the grid that could allow you to get multipliers with every spin, Eight Immortals is a valid choice even for those who are not mesmerized enough by its artistic features.\n\nTheme and Inspiration\n\nEight Immortals takes inspiration from the legend of the eight immortals, widely used in Chinese art and literature. From a graphic standpoint, Dreamtech has created an impeccable and decidedly captivating slot, especially for those who love animation and Japanese video games.

There are several music tracks, but they all reflect the oriental theme, although in some cases they also have modern and energetic sounds that can charge the player during the most intense moments.\n\nOther Similar Games\n\nIf after trying Eight Immortals you are still hungry for oriental culture, you could try 88 Fortunes, Asian Beauty, Choy Sun Doa or, if you love pugs, the bizarre Astro Pug.\n\nReturn to Player Percentage (RTP)\n\nWith a fairly generous RTP of 97.01% and a horizontal reel at the top of the grid that could allow you to get multipliers with every spin, Eight Immortals is a valid choice even for those who are not mesmerized enough by its artistic features.\n\n        \n            ",

Ancient villages, warriors, and the inevitable Chinese New Year have provided the backdrop for many interesting slots, and today's game is no exception. With Eight Immortals, Dreamtech takes us on a journey through Chinese mythology, drawing inspiration from the legend of the eight immortals, widely used in Chinese art and literature. Has Dreamtech managed to create a noteworthy slot machine or have they simply exploited these legendary figures? Let's find out by analyzing the graphics first.\n\nEight Immortals and its interesting characters\nSince the legend of the eight immortals is so famous, Eight Immortals is certainly not the only slot machine that takes inspiration from it, but it is definitely the one that does them the most honor. From a graphic standpoint, Dreamtech has created an impeccable and decidedly captivating slot, especially for those who love animation and Japanese video games. The background, although simple, is animated and consists of waves breaking on rocks, with a legendary creature similar to a manta occasionally jumping out of the water. The grid, consisting of 5 reels and 3 lines, is transparent, while the game data is displayed at the top and bottom of the screen framed in an oriental-style motif. The simplicity of the background is functional so as not to strain the player's eye too much and not create a confusing scene. The game symbols are much more detailed. Each one, except for the one with a simple table and some gold coins, is characterized by one of the eight immortal characters, which will also be animated in case you win a jackpot. The style in which the characters are drawn is very appealing and reminiscent of Japanese anime style. The Wild symbol is a golden letter while the scatter is a temple in the clouds. When you get free spins thanks to the scatter (which we will discuss in more detail in the next paragraph), the background changes and transports you to a mystical mountain vista among the clouds and cranes. There are several music tracks, but they all reflect the oriental theme, although in some cases they also have modern and energetic sounds that can charge the player during the most intense moments.\n\nEight Immortals, simple yet effective\nWhile Eight Immortals excels in graphic style, gameplay is rather simple. It does not have any particular modes, except for the 15 free spins (which can be reactivated and accumulated) activated by getting at least three scatters. With a fairly generous RTP of 97.01% and a horizontal reel at the top of the grid that could allow you to get multipliers with every spin, Eight Immortals is a valid choice even for those who are not mesmerized enough by its artistic features.\n\nOther slots like Eight Immortals\nIf after trying Eight Immortals you are still hungry for oriental culture, you could try 88 Fortunes, Asian Beauty, Choy Sun Doa or, if you love pugs, the bizarre Astro Pug.\n            ",

Ancient villages, warriors, and the inevitable Chinese New Year have provided the backdrop for many interesting slots, and today's game is no exception. With Eight Immortals, Dreamtech takes us on a journey through Chinese mythology, drawing inspiration from the legend of the eight immortals, widely used in Chinese art and literature. Has Dreamtech managed to create a noteworthy slot machine or have they simply exploited these legendary figures? Let's find out by analyzing the graphics first.\n\nEight Immortals and its interesting characters\nSince the legend of the eight immortals is so famous, Eight Immortals is certainly not the only slot machine that takes inspiration from it, but it is definitely the one that does them the most honor. From a graphic standpoint, Dreamtech has created an impeccable and decidedly captivating slot, especially for those who love animation and Japanese video games. The background, although simple, is animated and consists of waves breaking on rocks, with a legendary creature similar to a manta occasionally jumping out of the water. The grid, consisting of 5 reels and 3 lines, is transparent, while the game data is displayed at the top and bottom of the screen framed in an oriental-style motif. The simplicity of the background is functional so as not to strain the player's eye too much and not create a confusing scene. The game symbols are much more detailed. Each one, except for the one with a simple table and some gold coins, is characterized by one of the eight immortal characters, which will also be animated in case you win a jackpot. The style in which the characters are drawn is very appealing and reminiscent of Japanese anime style. The Wild symbol is a golden letter while the scatter is a temple in the clouds. When you get free spins thanks to the scatter (which we will discuss in more detail in the next paragraph), the background changes and transports you to a mystical mountain vista among the clouds and cranes. There are several music tracks, but they all reflect the oriental theme, although in some cases they also have modern and energetic sounds that can charge the player during the most intense moments.\n\nEight Immortals, simple yet effective\nWhile Eight Immortals excels in graphic style, gameplay is rather simple. It does not have any particular modes, except for the 15 free spins (which can be reactivated and accumulated) activated by getting at least three scatters. With a fairly generous RTP of 97.01% and a horizontal reel at the top of the grid that could allow you to get multipliers with every spin, Eight Immortals is a valid choice even for those who are not mesmerized enough by its artistic features.\n\nOther slots like Eight Immortals\nIf after trying Eight Immortals you are still hungry for oriental culture, you could try 88 Fortunes, Asian Beauty, Choy Sun Doa or, if you love pugs, the bizarre Astro Pug.\n            ",
