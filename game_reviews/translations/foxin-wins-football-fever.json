In questo nuovo appuntamento Fox si ritroverà direttamente coinvolta in una vera e propria partita di calcio, con tanto di cori appassionati e migliaia di persone stipate sugli spalti ad ammirare le sue gesta. È inutile dire che anche per Foxin’ Wins Football Fever la software house australiana abbia fatto un ottimo lavoro sotto il profilo della grafica, ricca di colori e con uno stile vicino a quello dei cartoni animati. Il comparto musicale passa dai cori da stadio a dei jingle allegri che partono in concomitanza con la rotazione dei rulli o con le vincite.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia è una classica 5×3, con 25 linee di pagamento fisse. Le scommesse partono da 0,25 € per spin, ma come successo negli altri capitoli della serie, anche qui è presente la funzione Super Bet con 2 livelli di scommessa che costano un po’ di più (minimo 0,35 € con il livello 1, 0,50 € con il livello 2), ma offrono bonus che rendono quasi certa la vincita. Per quel che riguarda il ritorno medio al giocatore (RTP), con Foxin’ Wins Football Fever siamo al 95,61%, mentre la volatilità è media.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nDiamo ora un’occhiata ai simboli, prima di vedere nello specifico i vantaggi portati dall’attivazione della funzione Super Bet. Partiamo da quelli di basso livello, naturalmente rappresentati dalle carte da gioco dal 9 all’asso. A seguire troviamo il rotolo di banconote e la statua dorata. Andando avanti le vincite cominciano a essere consistenti: le volpi che si affrontano nel cortile di casa pagano molto bene, uguale con Fox, alla guida di un auto in direzione stadio. Per quel che riguarda i simboli speciali, la volpe con la pipa è il nostro Wild e sostituisce tutti i simboli tranne lo Scatter, rappresentato qua da una pentola colma di monete d’oro. Con 3 Scatter otterremo 10 partite gratis, in cui i cuccioli di volpe appariranno più spesso. La funzione di questo simbolo è quello di trasformare i simboli in Jolly. Nel gioco regolare e con la scommessa Super Bet spenta, il cucciolo di volpe può apparire solo sul rullo 3, con il livello 1 sui rulli 2, 3 e 4 e con il livello 2 su tutti i rulli.\nEsistono poi 2 bonus casuali che possono essere assegnati di tanto in tanto, Deposito Volpe che elargisce un premio comunque vada e Perquisizione del Folletto, che invece ci ricompensa solo se riusciamo a catturare tutti i folletti. Ciò che è certo è che tutti i premi corrispondono a un moltiplicatore compreso tra 2x e 50x della nostra puntata.\n",

            "response": "\"Foxin’ Wins Football Fever\" is the latest addition to the successful slot series starring a charming aristocratic fox who will do whatever it takes to get his hands on the valuable prizes at stake. In this new game, Fox will be directly involved in a real football match, complete with passionate chants and thousands of people packed in the stands to admire his feats. As expected, the Australian software house has done an excellent job with the graphics, which are rich in color and have a cartoonish style. The music ranges from stadium chants to upbeat jingles that play when the reels spin or when there's a win.\n\nThis classic 5x3 grid slot has 25 fixed paylines, and bets start from €0.25 per spin. As with previous games in the series, there's a Super Bet feature with two bet levels that cost a bit more (minimum of €0.35 with level 1, and €0.50 with level 2), but offer bonuses that make winning almost guaranteed. The return to player (RTP) for Foxin’ Wins Football Fever is at a decent 95.61%, while the volatility is medium.\n\nNow let's dive into the symbols and their functionality. The low-paying symbols are the playing cards from 9 to ace. Then there's the roll of banknotes and the golden statue. As we go higher up the pay scale, we have foxes wrestling in the backyard, and Fox himself driving a car to the stadium - both of which pay very well. The Wild symbol is represented by the fox with a pipe, which replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented by a pot of gold coins. Three Scatters trigger 10 free games, where fox pups appear more frequently. The function of this symbol is to transform symbols into Wilds. In the regular game without Super Bet, the fox pup appears only on reel 3, with level 1 on reels 2, 3, and 4, and level 2 on all reels.\n\nThere are also two random bonuses that can be awarded from time to time: Fox Funds gives out a prize no matter what, and Leprechaun Shakedown rewards us only if we manage to catch all the leprechauns. One thing is certain - all prizes correspond to a multiplier ranging from 2x to 50x of our bet. As an experienced gambler, you know how exciting and lucrative Foxin’ Wins Football Fever can be. Give it a spin and experience the thrill of the game yourself!",

The game boasts exciting features and mechanics aimed at increasing players' chances of winning. Players can wager from as low as 0.25 € per spin. A Super Bet function is available, with two betting levels, which increases the cost of the spin (minimum 0.35 € with level 1 and 0.50 € with level 2) but gives players bonuses that almost guarantee a win.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nFoxin' Wins Football Fever by NextGen has visually stunning graphics that are rich in color and are close to the style of cartoons. The design of the game includes a soccer stadium, complete with cheering crowds and an aristocratic fox. The audio design captures the excitement of a real soccer match, with lively jingles that start spinning in conjunction with the reels or with winnings.\n\nBonuses and special symbols\n\nFoxin' Wins Football Fever has several bonuses and special symbols. The fox with the pipe is the Wild symbol and replaces all other symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter symbol, represented by a pot full of gold coins, rewards players with 10 free spins when they land three on the reels. The fox cubs symbol can transform symbols into Wilds and appears more often during free spins. With Super Bet turned off, the fox cub appears only on reel 3, on all reels with level 2, and on reels 2, 3, and 4 with level 1. The game also features two random bonuses: the Fox Funds and the Leprechaun Shakedown, where players can win multipliers ranging from 2x to 50x their bet.\n\nBetting options and RTP\n\nFoxin' Wins Football Fever has a minimum bet of 0.25 € per spin. The Super Bet function, available with two levels, costs a little more (minimum 0.35 € with level 1, 0.50 € with level 2) but provides players with greater bonuses that can increase their chances of winning. The game's RTP is set at 95.61%, which is average for a slot game. Players of any budget can comfortably enjoy the game with its flexible betting options.\n\nSymbols and paylines\n\nThe lowest paying symbols in Foxin' Wins Football Fever are playing cards from 9 to Ace. The banknotes and the golden statue offer higher payouts. The foxes competing in the backyard payout even more, especially when Fox drives a car towards the stadium. During the free spins, fox cubs appear more often, and players can win substantial payouts. The game has 25 fixed paylines, which is relatively standard. Players can review the paytable to understand the potential payouts of each symbol.\n\n        \n            ",

In this new installment, Fox finds himself directly involved in a real soccer match, complete with passionate cheers and thousands of people crowded on the stands admiring his feats. Needless to say, the Australian software house has done an excellent job with the graphics of Foxin’ Wins Football Fever, which are rich in colors and have a style close to that of cartoons. The musical component ranges from stadium cheers to cheerful jingles that start spinning in conjunction with the reels or with winnings.\nSlot Features\nThe grid is a classic 5x3, with 25 fixed paylines. Bets start at 0.25 € per spin, but as in the other chapters of the series, here too the Super Bet function is present with 2 betting levels that cost a little more (minimum 0.35 € with level 1, 0.50 € with level 2), but offer bonuses that almost guarantee a win. As for the average RTP (Return to Player), with Foxin’ Wins Football Fever we are at 95.61%, while volatility is average.\nSymbols and Features\nLet's take a look at the symbols before seeing in detail the advantages brought by activating the Super Bet function. We start with the low-level symbols, naturally represented by playing cards from 9 to Ace. Following them are the roll of banknotes and the golden statue. Moving on, the prizes begin to be substantial: the foxes competing in the backyard pay very well, even more so with Fox driving a car towards the stadium. As for the special symbols, the fox with the pipe is our Wild and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by a pot full of gold coins. With 3 Scatters, we get 10 free spins, in which fox cubs appear more often. The function of this symbol is to transform symbols into Wilds. In regular play and with Super Bet turned off, the fox cub can only appear on reel 3, with level 1 on reels 2, 3 and 4, and with level 2 on all reels.\nThere are also 2 random bonuses that can be awarded from time to time, Fox Funds, which awards a prize no matter what, and Leprechaun Shakedown, which rewards us only if we manage to catch all the leprechauns. What is certain is that all prizes correspond to a multiplier ranging from 2x to 50x our bet.\n            ",

In this new installment, Fox finds himself directly involved in a real soccer match, complete with passionate cheers and thousands of people crowded on the stands admiring his feats. Needless to say, the Australian software house has done an excellent job with the graphics of Foxin’ Wins Football Fever, which are rich in colors and have a style close to that of cartoons. The musical component ranges from stadium cheers to cheerful jingles that start spinning in conjunction with the reels or with winnings.\nSlot Features\nThe grid is a classic 5x3, with 25 fixed paylines. Bets start at 0.25 € per spin, but as in the other chapters of the series, here too the Super Bet function is present with 2 betting levels that cost a little more (minimum 0.35 € with level 1, 0.50 € with level 2), but offer bonuses that almost guarantee a win. As for the average RTP (Return to Player), with Foxin’ Wins Football Fever we are at 95.61%, while volatility is average.\nSymbols and Features\nLet's take a look at the symbols before seeing in detail the advantages brought by activating the Super Bet function. We start with the low-level symbols, naturally represented by playing cards from 9 to Ace. Following them are the roll of banknotes and the golden statue. Moving on, the prizes begin to be substantial: the foxes competing in the backyard pay very well, even more so with Fox driving a car towards the stadium. As for the special symbols, the fox with the pipe is our Wild and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by a pot full of gold coins. With 3 Scatters, we get 10 free spins, in which fox cubs appear more often. The function of this symbol is to transform symbols into Wilds. In regular play and with Super Bet turned off, the fox cub can only appear on reel 3, with level 1 on reels 2, 3 and 4, and with level 2 on all reels.\nThere are also 2 random bonuses that can be awarded from time to time, Fox Funds, which awards a prize no matter what, and Leprechaun Shakedown, which rewards us only if we manage to catch all the leprechauns. What is certain is that all prizes correspond to a multiplier ranging from 2x to 50x our bet.\n            ",
