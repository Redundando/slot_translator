The theme of the game is set on a cartoon-style farm with cute animal characters like Old McDonald's Farm.\n\nGraphics are basic, lacking the 3D effects and background music seen in other slots. However, the game makes up for it with the cute animal symbols and other farm-related icons like corn, fruits, and vegetables. The bunny is the slot's icon and, when it appears three, four, or five times after a spin, activates the bonus game, where players can win additional prizes.\n\nIn the bonus game, players click on one of the carrots offered by the bunnies on screen. The type of carrot chosen and the number of bunnies on the reels determine the player's potential winnings.\n\nCash Bunny also features Autoplay, which allows players to choose the number of desired spins without having to manually select each round. The game also offers a double spin function, which suggests the reels to stop or spin again if a previous round was unsuccessful.\n\nCash Bunny prizes are in points, where each point represents one cent of euro. The total winnings from a single game are summed, but only the highest win on a single line is considered.\n\nOverall, Cash Bunny is a classic slot that appeals to those who prefer simple, straightforward gameplay and a nostalgic feel.

The graphics are simple and basic with no special effects or 3D animation. There is also no background music.\nSymbols, Bonuses, and Wilds\nThe symbols are cartoons of animals and other farm-related items. You will see a rabbit (the slot's icon), a pig, a fox, fruit such as oranges and cherries, corn, a wheat sheaf, a bucket of vegetables, and a plump farmer. The latter two symbols represent the highest payout, and the fox acts as the Wild symbol, replacing all other images except for the Bonus. The iconic rabbit is the Bonus symbol, and landing it three, four, or five times in a spin triggers the special Bonus game. Players can win additional prizes by clicking on one of the rabbits shown in the Bonus game screen. The rabbit then picks a carrot from the garden depending on the type of carrot pulled and the number of rabbits on the reels.\nHow to Play\nPlayers can bet on each spin manually or use the Autoplay feature, selecting the number of spins desired from 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, or 500. Before starting the game, bettors need to select the amount they want to bet by using the BET button. The amount ranges from a minimum of €0.25 to a maximum of €4. Just press SPIN and the game begins! Cash Bunny is a Double Spin slot machine, which means that if no winning lines appear from a turn, the system suggests which reels to keep in place and which to spin again in the next round. Winnings are expressed in points, with each point equal to one cent of euro. While total wins from one game are added up, only the highest value win on a single line counts. Symbols have different value levels, with oranges, cherries, and vegetable buckets in the first level. Payouts are higher for the corncob and wheat sheaf symbols, while the highest rewards come from a winning alignment of the crows, pig, fox, and farmer.\nConclusion\nCash Bunny is a popular slot machine in brick-and-mortar casinos, perfect for \"nostalgic\" players who love traditional slots.

The graphics are simple and basic with no 3D animation or background music.\n\nWild and Bonus Symbols\n\nThe fox symbol acts as the Wild, replacing all other images except for the Bonus symbol. The Bonus symbol is the rabbit, and landing it three, four, or five times triggers the special Bonus game. Players can win additional prizes by clicking on one of the rabbits shown in the Bonus game screen. The rabbit then picks a carrot from the garden depending on the type of carrot pulled and the number of rabbits on the reels.\n\nPayout Symbols\n\nCash Bunny has symbols with different value levels, with oranges, cherries, and vegetable buckets in the first level, followed by the corncob and wheat sheaf symbols. The highest rewards come from a winning alignment of the crows, pig, fox, and farmer. Winnings are expressed in points, with each point equal to one cent of euro. While total wins from one game are added up, only the highest value win on a single line counts.\n\nBetting Options\n\nBefore starting the game, players need to select the amount they want to bet by using the BET button. The amount ranges from a minimum of €0.25 to a maximum of €4. Players can bet on each spin manually or use the Autoplay feature, selecting the number of spins desired from 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, or 500.\n\nGameplay Features\n\nCash Bunny is a 5-reel slot game with either 5 or 10 paylines. Players must match symbols from left to right on the paylines to win. The game is a Double Spin slot machine, which means that if no winning lines appear from a turn, the system suggests which reels to keep in place and which to spin again in the next round. Cash Bunny is designed to be easy and enjoyable to play, making it perfect for experienced gamblers and 'nostalgic' players who love traditional slots.\n\n        \n            ",

The game is a Double Spin slot machine, which allows players to spin again in the next round if no winning lines appear from a turn.\n\nSymbols and Theme\n\nThe theme of Cash Bunny is a cartoon farm, with animals such as rabbits, pigs, and foxes making up the symbols along with fruits, vegetables, and farm-related items. The graphics are simple and basic, with no special effects or 3D animation, and no background music. The fox is the Wild symbol and replaces all other images except for the Bonus, which is represented by the iconic rabbit. Landing three, four, or five rabbits in a spin triggers the Bonus game, where players can win additional prizes by clicking on one of the rabbits shown on the screen.\n\nPayouts\n\nCash Bunny awards payouts in points, with each point equal to one cent of euro. Symbols have different value levels, with oranges, cherries, and vegetable buckets in the first level. Payouts are higher for corncobs and wheat sheafs, while the highest rewards come from a winning alignment of crows, pigs, foxes, and farmers. While total wins from one game are added up, only the highest value win on a single line counts.\n\nAutoplay Function\n\nThe Autoplay function in Cash Bunny allows players to select the number of spins they desire, ranging from 5 to 500. Before starting the game, players must select the amount they want to bet by using the BET button, with the amount ranging from €0.25 to €4. Once the player hits SPIN, the game begins.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nCash Bunny is a traditional slot game, popular among nostalgic players who love a simple and enjoyable gaming experience. The lack of sound effects, basic graphics, and straightforward gameplay are perfect for experienced gamblers. The game can be played by anybody, but it targets players who want to take a break from more complex slots and enjoy playing a more traditional game.\n\n        \n            ",

Before starting the game, bettors need to select the amount they want to bet by using the BET button. The amount ranges from a minimum of €0.25 to a maximum of €4. Just press SPIN and the game begins! Cash Bunny is a Double Spin slot machine, which means that if no winning lines appear from a turn, the system suggests which reels to keep in place and which to spin again in the next round. Winnings are expressed in points, with each point equal to one cent of euro. While total wins from one game are added up, only the highest value win on a single line counts. Symbols have different value levels, with oranges, cherries, and vegetable buckets in the first level. Payouts are higher for the corncob and wheat sheaf symbols, while the highest rewards come from a winning alignment of the crows, pig, fox, and farmer.\nConclusion\nCash Bunny is a popular slot machine in brick-and-mortar casinos, perfect for \"nostalgic\" players who love traditional slots. The simple graphics and lack of soundtrack accompany a game designed to be easy and enjoyable to play for experienced gamblers.\n        ",
