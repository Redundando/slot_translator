            "response": "Celestial Beauty Review:\n\nIf you're familiar with Manga, the popular Japanese comics that inspired some of the most famous animé (for the most dedicated fans), you'll absolutely adore this slot game from Skywind Group. The characters and graphics closely resemble Sailor Moon, the cartoon that features innocent young girls who can transform into fearsome warriors dressed as sailors. In fact, Celestial Beauty is a mix of several Anime genres, as some symbols closely resemble the popular creatures from the world of Pokémon, another masterpiece of Japanese pop culture.\n\nSkywind has maintained a high-quality product, excelling in graphics to the point where it's hard to tell whether you're watching an animated cartoon or playing a game. The screen is well-organized, with play buttons vertically aligned on the right, and Buy Bonus and Double Chance buttons on the left. The same area has a counter that keeps track of the number of symbols collected in a single spin.\n\nCelestial Beauty Features:\n\nThe game grid is spacious, with 6 reels and 5 rows, and uses a cascade system, meaning that each time you land a winning combination, the symbols disappear to be replaced by new ones, allowing new combinations to be formed. You get a payout of at least 8 identical symbols arranged in any part of the grid, with a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum payout of 10,000 times the wager.\n\nThe Autoplay button allows you to set automatic spins, but be careful, in Celestial Beauty, autoplay spins continue until you click the button again. The turbo is the symbol for acceleration, which speeds up the rotation of the reels and the descent of the symbols.\n\nThe volatility in the base game is moderate, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.5%.\n\nHow to Win at Celestial Beauty:\n\nThe game's symbols can be divided by value: low, medium, and high. The red, purple, and aqua green stones are the least valuable, followed by the moon, the sun, and the heart. After the three animals, fox, owl, and dragon, come the red, yellow, and blue pendants that represent the Wild symbol, which appears with a multiplier ranging from x2 to x5. The heroine is the Scatter symbol, and when it lands three times in the same round, it rewards you with free spins.\n\nBefore activating the function, you'll be asked which mode you want to play:\n\nMoon Beauty: with low volatility, it rewards you with 10, 15, or 20 free spins. Wild symbols appear with a multiplier ranging from x2 to x20.\n\nSun Beauty: with high volatility, it rewards you with 8, 12, or 16 spins, with the same multiplier value as the other function.\n\nFAQs:\n\nHow can I play with Free Spins?\n\nYou can get free spins by landing at least 3 Scatters, or you can buy the Bonus at a cost of 100 times the bet. Alternatively, you can activate the Double Chance function, which increases the possibility of landing Scatters.\n\nWhat is the volatility of the game?\n\nThe base game has moderate volatility, while Moon Beauty has low and Sun Beauty has high volatility.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nCelestial Beauty has an RTP of 96.5%.",

The characters and graphics closely resemble Sailor Moon, the cartoon that features young innocent girls capable of transforming into fearsome warriors dressed as sailors. In reality, Celestial Beauty is a mixture of anime because some of the symbols closely resemble the cute Pokemon creatures, another masterpiece of Japanese pop culture.\n\nThe provider has maintained a high-quality product by doing an excellent job on the graphics, so much so that at first glance, it is difficult to say whether it is an animation or a game.\n\nThe screen space is well-organized, with the play buttons arranged vertically on the right side, and the Buy Bonus and Double Chance buttons on the left. There is also a counter on the same side that keeps track of the number of symbols collected in a single spin.\n\nFeatures of Celestial Beauty\nThe game grid is wide, with 6 reels and 5 rows. The game system is cascading, which means that every time we get a winning combo, the winning symbols disappear to be replaced by new ones with which to form new series. Payment is received with at least 8 identical symbols arranged in any part of the grid. The minimum bet is €0.20, and the maximum win is 10,000 times the bet.\n\nThe Autoplay button allows us to start automatic spins, but beware, as in Celestial Beauty, you keep going until you click on the same button again.\n\nThe speedometer symbol is the Turbo and is used to accelerate the rotation of the reels and the fall of the symbols. The volatility in the base game is medium, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.5%.\n\nHow to win in Celestial Beauty\nSymbols can be divided by value: low, medium, and high. The red, purple, and aqua green stones are the ones that are worth the least, immediately followed by the moon, the sun, and the heart. Then come the 3 animals, fox, owl, and dragon.\n\nThe red, yellow, and blue necklace pendants represent the Wild. In addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, it appears with a multiplier between x2 and x5.\n\nThe heroine is our Scatter, and when it lands three times during the same spin, it rewards us with free spins.

Alternatively, you can activate the Double Chance function, which increases the chance of getting Scatter.\n\nWhat is the volatility of the game?\nIn the base game, it is medium, low in the Moon Beauty function, and high in the Sun Beauty function.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\nCelestial Beauty has an RTP of 96.5%.\n            ",

The volatility in the base game is medium, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.5%.\n\nHow to win in Celestial Beauty\nSymbols can be divided by value: low, medium, and high. The red, purple, and aqua green stones are the ones that are worth the least, immediately followed by the moon, the sun, and the heart. Then come the 3 animals, fox, owl, and dragon.\n\nThe red, yellow, and blue necklace pendants represent the Wild. In addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, it appears with a multiplier between x2 and x5.\n\nThe heroine is our Scatter, and when it lands three times during the same spin, it rewards us with free spins. Before activating the function, we will be asked which mode we want to play:\n\nMoon Beauty: has low volatility and rewards with 10, 15, or 20 free spins. Wild symbols appear together with a multiplier between x2 and x20.\n\nSun Beauty: has high volatility and rewards with 8, 12, or 16 spins, while the value of the multipliers is identical to that of the other function.\n\nFAQs\nHow can I play with Free Spins?\nYou can get free spins by getting at least 3 Scatter, or you can buy the Bonus for 100 times the bet. Alternatively, you can activate the Double Chance function, which increases the chance of getting Scatter.\n\nWhat is the volatility of the game?\nIn the base game, it is medium, low in the Moon Beauty function, and high in the Sun Beauty function.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\nCelestial Beauty has an RTP of 96.5%.\n            ",

I once played the game for six hours straight, and for five hours and fifty-nine minutes, I chose the low volatility mode, thinking I was outsmarting the game when, in reality, it was outsmarting me. I mean, I was winning, but free spins weren't triggering that often. As soon as I switched to the high volatility mode, bam! Three free spins and two jackpots within an hour. I mean, I still lost all my money, but what an experience! </p>\n<p>But let's get back to business. If you're all about statistics, then the theoretical RTP of Celestial Beauty is something that will make you smile. With 96.5%, the game pays out about 96.5 cents for every dollar you wager over the long term, which is pretty good for a volatile slot game. If you're feeling lucky, give this game a try and remember, sometimes you have to take a risk to win big!</p>"

Winning combos make way for new symbols to appear and form new series. Payment is made for at least 8 identical symbols arranged in any part of the grid. The minimum bet is €0.20, and the maximum win is 10,000 times the bet. Players can use the Autoplay button to initiate automatic spins but need to click it again to stop them. Turbo symbol can be used to accelerate the rotation of the reels and the fall of the symbols. The volatility in the base game is medium, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.5%.\n\nVisual design of the game\n\nCelestial Beauty has a manga aesthetic that closely resembles popular Japanese comics and anime, particularly Sailor Moon and Pokemon. The characters and graphics are of high-quality. The design appears animated and could easily be mistaken for an animation series rather than a slot game. The game layout is well-organized, with the play buttons arranged vertically on the right side and the Buy Bonus and Double Chance buttons on the left. There is a counter on the same side that keeps track of the number of symbols collected.\n\nSymbols and paylines\n\nSymbols in Celestial Beauty are divided into three value categories: low, medium, and high. The low-value symbols are red, purple, and aqua green stones, followed by the moon, the sun, and the heart. The 3 animals, fox, owl, and dragon, form the medium-value group. The red, yellow, and blue necklace pendants represent the Wild and can appear with a multiplier between x2 and x5. The heroine symbol is the Scatter and rewards  free spins when it lands three times during the same spin.\n\nBonuses and special features\n\nCelestial Beauty has a free spin mode that is activated by landing three Scatter symbols during the same spin. Before activating the feature, players are asked to choose whether they want to play the Moon Beauty or Sun Beauty mode. In Moon Beauty mode, players receive rewards low volatility free spins and Wild symbols with a multiplier of between x2 and x20. Sun Beauty mode has high volatility free spins and features the same value of multipliers as in Moon Beauty mode. Additionally, players can buy the Bonus for 100 times the bet and increase their chance of getting Scatters by activating the Double Chance feature.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP) percentage\n\nCelestial Beauty has a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.5%.\n\n        \n            ",

The Autoplay button is available for automatic spins, and the Turbo symbol accelerates the rotation of the reels and the fall of the symbols. The game's volatility in the base game is medium, while the theoretical RTP is 96.5%.\n\nGraphics\n\nCelestial Beauty has an excellent graphical design similar to Sailor Moon, with symbols that resemble the cute Pokemon creatures, giving it a mixture of anime style. The graphics are of high quality, and it is difficult to tell whether it is an animation or a game at first glance. The screen is well-organized, with the play buttons on the right side, and the Buy Bonus and Double Chance buttons on the left, making it easy to navigate.\n\nBonus Features\n\nWild symbols in Celestial Beauty are represented by red, yellow, and blue necklace pendants that replace all symbols except for the Scatter. When landing three Scatters on a single spin, we receive free spins. Before activating the function, we can choose between Moon Beauty, which has low volatility and rewards with 10, 15, or 20 free spins, and Sun Beauty, which has high volatility and awards 8, 12, or 16 spins. In both modes, Wild symbols come with a multiplier between x2 and x20.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nIn Celestial Beauty, winning combinations are formed by having at least 8 identical symbols arranged anywhere on the grid. The minimum bet is €0.20, and the maximum win is 10,000 times the bet. The Wild symbol can also appear with a multiplier between x2 and x5, further increasing the winning potential.\n\nVolatility\n\nCelestial Beauty has a medium volatility in the base game, which means that winning combinations occur reasonably often. During free spins, the volatility level changes depending on the mode we choose. Moon Beauty has low volatility, while Sun Beauty has high volatility. The theoretical RTP of the game is 96.5%, indicating that the game pays out about 96.5 cents for every dollar wagered over the long term.\n\n        \n            ",

The characters and graphics closely resemble Sailor Moon, the cartoon that features young innocent girls capable of transforming into fearsome warriors dressed as sailors. In reality, Celestial Beauty is a mixture of anime because some of the symbols closely resemble the cute Pokemon creatures, another masterpiece of Japanese pop culture.\n\nThe provider has maintained a high-quality product by doing an excellent job on the graphics, so much so that at first glance, it is difficult to say whether it is an animation or a game.\n\nThe screen space is well-organized, with the play buttons arranged vertically on the right side, and the Buy Bonus and Double Chance buttons on the left. There is also a counter on the same side that keeps track of the number of symbols collected in a single spin.\n\nFeatures of Celestial Beauty\nThe game grid is wide, with 6 reels and 5 rows. The game system is cascading, which means that every time we get a winning combo, the winning symbols disappear to be replaced by new ones with which to form new series. Payment is received with at least 8 identical symbols arranged in any part of the grid. The minimum bet is €0.20, and the maximum win is 10,000 times the bet.\n\nThe Autoplay button allows us to start automatic spins, but beware, as in Celestial Beauty, you keep going until you click on the same button again.\n\nThe speedometer symbol is the Turbo and is used to accelerate the rotation of the reels and the fall of the symbols. The volatility in the base game is medium, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.5%.\n\nHow to win in Celestial Beauty\nSymbols can be divided by value: low, medium, and high. The red, purple, and aqua green stones are the ones that are worth the least, immediately followed by the moon, the sun, and the heart. Then come the 3 animals, fox, owl, and dragon.\n\nThe red, yellow, and blue necklace pendants represent the Wild. In addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, it appears with a multiplier between x2 and x5.\n\nThe heroine is our Scatter, and when it lands three times during the same spin, it rewards us with free spins. Before activating the function, we will be asked which mode we want to play:\n\nMoon Beauty: has low volatility and rewards with 10, 15, or 20 free spins. Wild symbols appear together with a multiplier between x2 and x20.\n\nSun Beauty: has high volatility and rewards with 8, 12, or 16 spins, while the value of the multipliers is identical to that of the other function.\n\nFAQs\nHow can I play with Free Spins?\nYou can get free spins by getting at least 3 Scatter, or you can buy the Bonus for 100 times the bet. Alternatively, you can activate the Double Chance function, which increases the chance of getting Scatter.\n\nWhat is the volatility of the game?\nIn the base game, it is medium, low in the Moon Beauty function, and high in the Sun Beauty function.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\nCelestial Beauty has an RTP of 96.5%.\n            ",

The characters and graphics closely resemble Sailor Moon, the cartoon that features young innocent girls capable of transforming into fearsome warriors dressed as sailors. In reality, Celestial Beauty is a mixture of anime because some of the symbols closely resemble the cute Pokemon creatures, another masterpiece of Japanese pop culture.\n\nThe provider has maintained a high-quality product by doing an excellent job on the graphics, so much so that at first glance, it is difficult to say whether it is an animation or a game.\n\nThe screen space is well-organized, with the play buttons arranged vertically on the right side, and the Buy Bonus and Double Chance buttons on the left. There is also a counter on the same side that keeps track of the number of symbols collected in a single spin.\n\nFeatures of Celestial Beauty\nThe game grid is wide, with 6 reels and 5 rows. The game system is cascading, which means that every time we get a winning combo, the winning symbols disappear to be replaced by new ones with which to form new series. Payment is received with at least 8 identical symbols arranged in any part of the grid. The minimum bet is €0.20, and the maximum win is 10,000 times the bet.\n\nThe Autoplay button allows us to start automatic spins, but beware, as in Celestial Beauty, you keep going until you click on the same button again.\n\nThe speedometer symbol is the Turbo and is used to accelerate the rotation of the reels and the fall of the symbols. The volatility in the base game is medium, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.5%.\n\nHow to win in Celestial Beauty\nSymbols can be divided by value: low, medium, and high. The red, purple, and aqua green stones are the ones that are worth the least, immediately followed by the moon, the sun, and the heart. Then come the 3 animals, fox, owl, and dragon.\n\nThe red, yellow, and blue necklace pendants represent the Wild. In addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, it appears with a multiplier between x2 and x5.\n\nThe heroine is our Scatter, and when it lands three times during the same spin, it rewards us with free spins. Before activating the function, we will be asked which mode we want to play:\n\nMoon Beauty: has low volatility and rewards with 10, 15, or 20 free spins. Wild symbols appear together with a multiplier between x2 and x20.\n\nSun Beauty: has high volatility and rewards with 8, 12, or 16 spins, while the value of the multipliers is identical to that of the other function.\n\nFAQs\nHow can I play with Free Spins?\nYou can get free spins by getting at least 3 Scatter, or you can buy the Bonus for 100 times the bet. Alternatively, you can activate the Double Chance function, which increases the chance of getting Scatter.\n\nWhat is the volatility of the game?\nIn the base game, it is medium, low in the Moon Beauty function, and high in the Sun Beauty function.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\nCelestial Beauty has an RTP of 96.5%.\n            ",
