The backdrop is a desolate and abandoned city with a purple sky overhead, and the reels are on a rail car armored vehicle. The left-hand side has a gas mask and transparent tubes filled with orange liquid, presumably motor oil. The wheels are chained, and where the symbols land appears to be the mouths of many cannons. The buttons for the game are small in size, located at the bottom, offering an unobstructed view of the game.\n\nThe music accompanying the spins has a Western sound with darker nuances, and the sound of iron and treads can be heard when the reels are spun instead of a typical mechanical sound.\n\nFeatures of Money Cart 3:\n\nThe game grid consists of 5 reels and 4 rows, accommodating up to 20 symbols. The minimum bet accepted is 0.20€, while the maximum is 100€. The maximum payout is a hefty 10,000 times the bet, which is difficult, but possible to achieve. The Autoplay feature allows for the adjustment of automatic spins between 10-1000 rounds, and for those who want it more infinite, one can click on the infinity symbol and lock it independently. The return to player (RTP) is 96%, and the volatility is high.\n\nHow to Play Money Cart 3:\n\nUnlike typical slot games with cards, medium, and high-level base symbols creating winning combos, scatters, and wilds, Money Cart 3 does not feature any of these. Clicking on the start button lands a single symbol called a bonus on the reels, and the goal is to get 3 of these symbols to activate 3 respins where symbols remain fixed in their position and are assigned a monetary value. If any other symbol appears during the respins, the count restarts from 3. After three turns without a symbol, the sums of the symbols’ values are collected, and the game returns to its regular mode.\n\nDuring the bonus game, there are several interesting modifiers that increase winnings, with some collecting all the prizes, others multiplying them from 2-6 times, while others reactivate already used modifiers. Some also ensure that the modifiers remain present throughout all respins, changing winnings with each spin.\n\nFurthermore, when a reel is filled with symbols, an additional reel is given to play.

The game's atmosphere is inspired by a post-apocalyptic Mad Max with a destroyed and uninhabited city overhung by a purple sky, which serves as the background for the game. The game grid is an armored wagon that runs on rails, while the buttons are located at the bottom and have small dimensions, leaving the entire visual field free. The music that accompanies the spins has western sounds but with darker nuances. When the reels are spun, the sound of iron and treads is heard.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"headline\": \"Gameplay\",\n    \"content\": \"Money Cart 3 has a game grid with 5 reels and 4 rows that can accommodate up to 20 symbols. The bet must be made before playing, with a minimum of €0.20 and a maximum of €100. The maximum win is 10,000 times the bet. The Autoplay function allows you to set from 10 to 1000 automatic spins, but for those who do not want limits, you can click the infinity symbol and then block them autonomously. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96%, and the volatility is high.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"headline\": \"Symbols\",\n    \"content\": \"Money Cart 3 doesn't have playing cards, medium and high level basic symbols, Scatter or Wilds.

The goal of the game is to get 3 of these symbols to activate 3 Respins, during which the symbols remain stationary in their positions. First, however, the symbols are assigned a monetary value. If any other symbol appears during Respins, then the count starts again from 3. When three spins are completed without any symbol appearing, the sums indicated on the symbols are collected and the game returns to the regular mode. Additional reels are obtained when a reel is filled with symbols.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"headline\": \"Modifiers\",\n    \"content\": \"During the Bonus game, there are several modifiers that can increase your winnings.

The game has post-apocalyptic Mad Max atmospheres with stunning graphics and impressive gameplay design.\n\nGameplay\n\nMoney Cart 3 features a game grid with 5 reels and 4 rows that can hold up to 20 symbols. To play, players must place a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum bet of €100. Players can win up to 10,000x the bet in this high-volatility slot game. The Autoplay function allows players to set between 10 and 1000 automatic spins, or players can click the infinity symbol to spin infinitely. The theoretical return to player (RTP) rate of Money Cart 3 is 96%.\n\nSymbols and Modifiers\n\nMoney Cart 3 does not feature traditional slot game symbols. Instead, a single symbol called Bonus lands on the reels and activates 3 Respins when 3 of them are collected. During Respins, the symbols remain stationary, and players try to obtain as many monetary values as possible by landing other symbols. There are several modifiers that make the winnings soar, including ones that collect all prizes, multiply them from 2 to 6 times, reactivate already used modifiers, or keep the modifiers present during all Respins and modify winnings at each turn. Players can gain an additional reel to play with when a reel is filled with symbols.\n\nAutoplay Function\n\nThe Autoplay function in Money Cart 3 allows players to set between 10 and 1000 automatic spins. The infinity symbol also allows players to spin infinitely. However, players must keep in mind that this is a high-volatility slot game, and winnings are not guaranteed.\n\nReturn to Player and Volatility\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) rate of Money Cart 3 is 96%. The game's volatility is high, making the game more unpredictable and possibly resulting in longer losing streaks but potential for larger payouts.\n\n        \n            ",

The game's atmosphere is inspired by a post-apocalyptic Mad Max with a destroyed and uninhabited city overhung by a purple sky, which serves as the background for the game. The game grid is an armored wagon that runs on rails, while the buttons are located at the bottom and have small dimensions, leaving the entire visual field free. The music that accompanies the spins has western sounds but with darker nuances. When the reels are spun, the sound of iron and treads is heard.\n\nGameplay\n\nMoney Cart 3 has a game grid with 5 reels and 4 rows that can accommodate up to 20 symbols. The bet must be made before playing, with a minimum of €0.20 and a maximum of €100. The maximum win is 10,000 times the bet. The Autoplay function allows you to set from 10 to 1000 automatic spins, but for those who do not want limits, you can click the infinity symbol and then block them autonomously. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96%, and the volatility is high.\n\nSymbols\n\nMoney Cart 3 doesn't have playing cards, medium and high level basic symbols, Scatter or Wilds. When the Start button is pressed, a single symbol called Bonus lands on the reels. The goal of the game is to get 3 of these symbols to activate 3 Respins, during which the symbols remain stationary in their positions. First, however, the symbols are assigned a monetary value. If any other symbol appears during Respins, then the count starts again from 3. When three spins are completed without any symbol appearing, the sums indicated on the symbols are collected and the game returns to the regular mode. Additional reels are obtained when a reel is filled with symbols.\n\nModifiers\n\nDuring the Bonus game, there are several modifiers that can increase your winnings. Some collect all prizes, while others multiply them from 2 to 6 times, or reactivate already used modifiers. There are also those that make the modifiers stay present during all Respins and modify winnings at each turn.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nMoney Cart 3 has a theoretical return to player of 96%, and the volatility is high. The maximum win is 10,000 times the bet, while the Autoplay function allows you to set from 10 to 1000 automatic spins. The game can be played on any device and with any operating system, IOS, Android, etc.\n\n        \n            ",

The Autoplay function allows you to set from 10 to 1000 automatic spins, but for those who do not want limits, you can click the infinity symbol and then block them autonomously.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96%, and the volatility is high.\n \nHow to play Money Cart 3\nIf you expect playing cards, medium and high level basic symbols with which to create winning combinations, Scatter and Wild, you are off track because you will not find anything like that.\nAs soon as we click the Start button, we will see a single symbol called Bonus land on the reels. The initial goal of the game is to get 3 of these symbols to activate 3 Respins, during which the symbols will remain stationary in their positions. First, however, they will be assigned a monetary value. If any other symbol appears during Respins, then the count starts again from 3. When three spins are completed without any symbol appearing, the sums indicated on the symbols are collected and the game returns to the regular mode. During the Bonus game, there are several really interesting modifiers that make winnings soar. Some collect all prizes, others multiply them from 2 to 6 times, others reactivate already used modifiers. There are also those that make the modifiers stay present during all Respins and that modify winnings at each turn.\nAlso, when a reel is filled with symbols, an additional reel to play with will be obtained.\nWhen Respins end, the game starts again.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the maximum win in Money Cart 3?\nIn this slot, you can win up to 10,000 times the bet.\n\nWhere can I find this game?\nOn all online casinos with AAMS certification.\n\nCan I play Money Cart 3 on my phone?\nOf course, Money Cart works on any device and with any operating system, IOS, Android, etc.\n            ",

The background is a destroyed and uninhabited city overhung by a purple sky, the road is crossed by rails on which an armored wagon arrives, our game grid. The left side of the vehicle has a gas mask and transparent tubes in which orange liquid, probably motor oil, flows. The wheels are tight with chains and where the symbols land, there seem to be the mouths of many cannons.\nThe buttons are located at the bottom and have small dimensions, leaving the entire visual field free.\nThe music that accompanies the spins has western sounds but with darker nuances. When the reels are spun, instead of the typical mechanical sound, the sound of iron and treads is heard.\n \nMoney Cart 3 Features\nThe game grid with 5 reels and 4 rows can accommodate up to 20 symbols.
