            "response": "Astro Cat\nWhen Japanese anime, Asian-themed slot games and an abundance of Hello Kitty are combined, one is taking a risk, but what you get is represented by the 1296 ways to win the new slot game Astro Cat. Oh yes, we were missing space, this cat has a lot to do! At first glance, we were not sure if a designer had become a rogue or if this was a serious production of Lightning Box slot, as it seems that the eclectic theme is just part of the game's charm.\n\nAvailable on both mobile and desktop devices, both for free play and as a real money slot, this game clearly hopes to impress with its theme, gameplay, and innovative structure. Like the popular Druidess Gold slot machine from Lightning Box, Astro Cat uses the Reelfecta system, where two 2x3 reels sit next to a 16-position grid reel in the center. It seems a bit confusing, but mostly plays like a 5x3 reel slot, given the winning format.\n\nAstro Cat will take you on a journey to China with an 8 reel and 1296 ways to win slot from Lightning Box Games. A bonus feature is provided that rewards up to a dozen free spins complete with blocks and prizes paid up to 16 times thanks to the Reelfecta game engine. Play from 50 cents up to €1250 per spin.\n\nSpace Graphics\nI simply cannot explain the theme of this game, there is too much going on. The Astro Cat of the game's title forms the wild game and is clearly in some crazy cosmic adventure. For some reason, this game required a theme in some form of ancient Asian setting, so you get reels framed in traditional Chinese style, with a Japanese anime cat, and some fireworks as a bonus trigger.\n\nThere are also other Asian images in the rest of the reels, with bonsai trees, koi carp, Chinese fans, and lucky frogs that are part of the paid icon assembly. The rest of the payment symbols are completed by real playing card symbols and for that once we do not mind; if all the symbols on this giant reel set were tailor-made, I think we would be venturing too far.\n\nThe audio is good: it doesn't inspire, but it's hard to produce a single track to accommodate all the different styles; the sound effects are superb, and the animations and rendering are excellent. There is no doubt about the visual credentials of this game, or the care with which the production work has been handled, this is well away from the old Fortune 8 Cat slot game.\n\nThe images have a strong Asian touch - in addition to the lower value playing cards, there are fans, bonsai trees, a red fish, a green frog and a dragon. The Japanese anime-style cat is the game's wild - it only appears on reels 3 and 4 and replaces all other symbols except the bonus.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nWith a 1296 ways to win format, the minimum bet is 0.50 coins at a value of 0.01, this can be increased exponentially, and you can also choose a bet multiplier of up to 5 times. There are no paylines to select, so it's simply a matter of manually hitting or, if you're as lazy as me, auto-spinning once the desired bet is selected. The basic gameplay action is a bit silent, like many new online slot game titles, Astro Cat relies on a bonus system that builds in intensity to offer big combination prizes. The RTP is generous, the hit rate, on the other hand, is not as much.\n\nThe Astro Cat wild symbol replaces all the symbols in this game, including, very importantly, the game's scatter symbol that triggers up to 13 free spins. This may not seem like the luckiest number, however, wild symbols on the Reelfecta center reel are persistent or sticky, each time one appears it remains in place for the duration of the spins, also adding an extra spin as a re-trigger. If you fill the whole center box with wilds during the free spins, it can trigger a single mega spin. The symbol you don't want to see is the poisoned glass, marked by the ubiquitous skull and crossbones, this will immediately end the free spins.\n\nThe fireworks symbol is the bonus, which only appears on the outer reels of the Reelfecta. Landing 5 or more of these on the same spin will trigger the Free Spins feature, where you can see up to 12 free spins.\n\nOnce the free spins begin, keep an eye on the Reelfecta - starting from the top left outside position, a +1 Wild Cat or a poison symbol will appear. If you land the +1 Wild Cat, you will receive an additional free spin, and the wild will be frozen in place. Here, up to 12 additional free spins can be awarded.\n\nFill 12 outer positions with Wild Cats and you will also fill the inner positions - this creates 1 giant wild with 16 symbols. You will then receive 1 Mega Spin with all the extra wilds in place. If the poison appears, you will receive a payout equivalent to 2 times the bet, and the feature ends. It is guaranteed that you will not receive a poison in the first 3 free spins.\n\nThe unorthodox game engine and unusual Reelfecta feature make Astro Cat more complex than it really is.\nOther similar slot machines\nI recommend checking out Playtech, which offers many Chinese-themed slots such as Sun Wukong and Jade Emperor.",

Il gatto in stile anime è il wild del gioco – appare solo sui rulli 3 e 4 e sostituisce tutti gli altri simboli oltre al bonus.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nCon un formato di 1296 modi per vincere, la puntata minima è di 0,50 monete a un valore di 0,01, questo può essere aumentato in modo esponenziale e si può scegliere anche un moltiplicatore di scommesse fino a 5 volte. Non ci sono linee di pagamento da selezionare, quindi si tratta semplicemente di colpire manualmente o,se pigro come me, auto-spintare una volta selezionata la scommessa desiderata. L’azione di gioco di base è un po’ silenziosa, come molti nuovi titoli di giochi di slot online, Astro Cat si affida ad un sistema di bonus che costruisce in intensità per offrire grandi premi di combinazione. La RTP è generosa, il rapporto di successo, d’altra parte, non tanto.\nIl simbolo jolly Astro Cat sostituisce tutti i simboli di questo gioco, compreso, cosa molto importante, il simbolo dello scatter del gioco che fa scattare fino a 13 giri gratis. Questo potrebbe non sembrare il numero più fortunato, tuttavia i simboli wild sulla bobina centrale reelfecta sono persistenti o appiccicosi, ogni volta che ne appare uno rimane al suo posto per tutta la durata dei giri, aggiungendo anche un giro extra come re-trigger. Se si sente l’intera casella centrale con i wilds durante i giri liberi si può innescare un singolo mega giro. Il simbolo che non volete vedere è il vetro avvelenato, segnato dall’onnipresente teschio e dalle ossa incrociate, questo metterà immediatamente fine ai giri liberi.\nIl simbolo dei fuochi d’artificio è il bonus, che appare solo sui rulli esterni della Reelfecta. L’atterraggio di 5 o più di questi sullo stesso giro farà scattare la funzione Free Spins, dove si potranno vedere fino a 12 giri liberi.\nUna volta che i giri liberi iniziano, tenete d’occhio il Reelfecta – partendo dalla posizione esterna in alto a sinistra, apparirà un +1 Gatto Selvatico o un simbolo di veleno. Se atterrate il +1 Gatto Selvaggio, riceverete un ulteriore giro libero e il wild sarà congelato al suo posto. Qui possono essere assegnati fino a 12 giri extra gratuiti.\nRiempite 12 posizioni esterne con Wild Cats e riempirete anche le posizioni interne – questo crea 1 gigantesco wild a 16 simboli. Riceverete quindi 1 Mega Spin con tutti i wild extra al loro posto. Se il veleno appare, riceverete un payout equivalente a 2 volte la scommessa e la funzione termina. È garantito che non riceverai un veleno nei primi 3 giri gratuiti.\nIl motore di gioco poco ortodosso e l’insolita funzione Reelfecta rendono l’Astro Cat più complesso di quanto non sia in realtà.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nVi consiglio di dare un’occhiata a Playtech che offre molte slot a tema cinese come Sun Wukong e Jade Emperor.\n\n        ",

This space-savvy cat has a whole lot going on! At first glance, we weren't sure if the designer had gone rogue or if this was a serious production by Lightning Box, but the eclectic theme is part of the game's charm.\n\nAvailable both on mobile and desktop, as well as for free or as a real-money slot game, Astro Cat hopes to impress with its innovative theme, gameplay, and structure. Like the popular Druidess Gold slot game by Lightning Box, Astro Cat employs the Reelfecta system, where two 2x3 reels are adjacent to a 16-position grid reel center. It may seem a bit confusing, but it mostly plays like a 5x3 reel slot, given the win format.\n\nAstro Cat takes you on a journey to China, with an eight-reel, 1296 ways-to-win slot game from Lightning Box Games. The game features a bonus function that rewards up to a dozen complete free spins, complete with blocks and prizes paid up to 16 times thanks to the Reelfecta game engine. Play from 50 cents to 1,250€ per spin.\n\nSuperb Graphics\n\nI simply can't explain the theme of this game - there are too many things at play. The Astro Cat in the game's title acts as the wild and is clearly on some mad cosmic adventure. For some reason, this game required an ancient Asian-themed setting, so you get Chinese-style framed reels, a Japanese anime cat and some fireworks as a bonus trigger.\n\nThere are other Asian images on the rest of the reels, with bonsai, koi carp, Chinese fans and lucky frogs part of the setup of paying icons. The rest of the paying symbol set is completed by the standard playing card symbols, which, for once, we don't mind. If all the symbols on this giant reel set were custom-made, I think we would be venturing too far.\n\nThe audio is decent - it doesn't inspire, but it's difficult to produce a single music track to accommodate all the different styles. The sound effects are superb, and the animation and rendering are excellent. There's no doubt about the visual credentials of this game, or about the care with which the production work was handled - this is a far cry from the old Fortune 8 Cat slot game.\n\nFunction and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nWith a 1296 ways-to-win format, the minimum bet is 0.50 coins at a value of 0.01, which can be increased exponentially, and you can also choose a betting multiplier of up to 5 times. There are no paylines to select, so it's simply a matter of hitting manually or, if you're lazy like me, auto-spinning once your desired bet is selected. The base gameplay is a bit silent, like many new online slot game titles - Astro Cat relies on a bonus system that builds up in intensity to offer big combination rewards. The RTP is generous, but the success ratio, on the other hand, not so much.\n\nThe Astro Cat wild symbol replaces all symbols in this game, including, most importantly, the game's scatter symbol that triggers up to 13 free spins. This may not seem like the luckiest number, however wild symbols on the reelfecta central reel are sticky, every time one appears, it remains in place for the duration of the spins, adding one extra spin as a re-trigger. If the entire central grid is filled with wilds during free spins, you can trigger a single mega spin. The symbol you don't want to see is the poisoned glass, marked by the ubiquitous skull and crossbones, this immediately ends the free spins.\n\nThe fireworks symbol is the bonus symbol, which appears only on the outer reels of the Reelfecta. Landing five or more of these on the same spin will trigger the Free Spins feature, where you can see up to 12 free spins.\n\nOnce free spins start, keep an eye on the Reelfecta - starting from the top left outer position, a +1 Wild Cat or a poison symbol will appear. If you land a +1 Wild Cat, you'll get an extra free spin, and the wild cat will freeze in place. Here, up to 12 extra free spins can be awarded.\n\nFill up all the 12 outer positions with Wild Cats and you'll also fill the central positions - this creates one giant 16-symbol wild. You'll then receive one Mega Spin with all the extra wilds in place. If the poison appears, you'll receive a payout equivalent to 2 times the bet, and the feature ends. You're guaranteed not to receive a poison in the first three free spins.\n\nThe unorthodox game engine and unusual Reelfecta feature make Astro Cat more complex than it actually is.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nWe recommend checking out Playtech's many Chinese-themed slot games such as Sun Wukong and Jade Emperor for more fun and exciting gameplay!"

Oh yes, we were missing space, this cat has a lot to do! At first glance, we were not sure if a designer had become a rogue or if this was a serious production of Lightning Box slot, as it seems that the eclectic theme is just part of the game's charm.\n\nAvailable on both mobile and desktop devices, both for free play and as a real money slot, this game clearly hopes to impress with its theme, gameplay, and innovative structure. Like the popular Druidess Gold slot machine from Lightning Box, Astro Cat uses the Reelfecta system, where two 2x3 reels sit next to a 16-position grid reel in the center. It seems a bit confusing, but mostly plays like a 5x3 reel slot, given the winning format.\n\nAstro Cat will take you on a journey to China with an 8 reel and 1296 ways to win slot from Lightning Box Games. A bonus feature is provided that rewards up to a dozen free spins complete with blocks and prizes paid up to 16 times thanks to the Reelfecta game engine. Play from 50 cents up to €1250 per spin.\n\nSpace Graphics\nI simply cannot explain the theme of this game, there is too much going on. The Astro Cat of the game's title forms the wild game and is clearly in some crazy cosmic adventure. For some reason, this game required a theme in some form of ancient Asian setting, so you get reels framed in traditional Chinese style, with a Japanese anime cat, and some fireworks as a bonus trigger.\n\nThere are also other Asian images in the rest of the reels, with bonsai trees, koi carp, Chinese fans, and lucky frogs that are part of the paid icon assembly. The rest of the payment symbols are completed by real playing card symbols and for that once we do not mind; if all the symbols on this giant reel set were tailor-made, I think we would be venturing too far.\n\nThe audio is good: it doesn't inspire, but it's hard to produce a single track to accommodate all the different styles; the sound effects are superb, and the animations and rendering are excellent. There is no doubt about the visual credentials of this game, or the care with which the production work has been handled, this is well away from the old Fortune 8 Cat slot game.\n\nThe images have a strong Asian touch - in addition to the lower value playing cards, there are fans, bonsai trees, a red fish, a green frog and a dragon. The Japanese anime-style cat is the game's wild - it only appears on reels 3 and 4 and replaces all other symbols except the bonus.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nWith a 1296 ways to win format, the minimum bet is 0.50 coins at a value of 0.01, this can be increased exponentially, and you can also choose a bet multiplier of up to 5 times. There are no paylines to select, so it's simply a matter of manually hitting or, if you're as lazy as me, auto-spinning once the desired bet is selected. The basic gameplay action is a bit silent, like many new online slot game titles, Astro Cat relies on a bonus system that builds in intensity to offer big combination prizes. The RTP is generous, the hit rate, on the other hand, is not as much.\n\nThe Astro Cat wild symbol replaces all the symbols in this game, including, very importantly, the game's scatter symbol that triggers up to 13 free spins. This may not seem like the luckiest number, however, wild symbols on the Reelfecta center reel are persistent or sticky, each time one appears it remains in place for the duration of the spins, also adding an extra spin as a re-trigger. If you fill the whole center box with wilds during the free spins, it can trigger a single mega spin. The symbol you don't want to see is the poisoned glass, marked by the ubiquitous skull and crossbones, this will immediately end the free spins.\n\nThe fireworks symbol is the bonus, which only appears on the outer reels of the Reelfecta. Landing 5 or more of these on the same spin will trigger the Free Spins feature, where you can see up to 12 free spins.\n\nOnce the free spins begin, keep an eye on the Reelfecta - starting from the top left outside position, a +1 Wild Cat or a poison symbol will appear. If you land the +1 Wild Cat, you will receive an additional free spin, and the wild will be frozen in place. Here, up to 12 additional free spins can be awarded.\n\nFill 12 outer positions with Wild Cats and you will also fill the inner positions - this creates 1 giant wild with 16 symbols. You will then receive 1 Mega Spin with all the extra wilds in place. If the poison appears, you will receive a payout equivalent to 2 times the bet, and the feature ends. It is guaranteed that you will not receive a poison in the first 3 free spins.\n\nThe unorthodox game engine and unusual Reelfecta feature make Astro Cat more complex than it really is.\nOther similar slot machines\nI recommend checking out Playtech, which offers many Chinese-themed slots such as Sun Wukong and Jade Emperor.\n            ",

During this, all extra Wilds are put into place, shining a light on some pretty spectacular possibilities for immense payouts. So, if you're looking for a slot game that will keep you hooked for hours on end - and make you feel like a winner before you even start - then Astro Cat has got you covered!</p>\"\n}"

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay features\n\nAstro Cat presents a 1296 ways to win format, where the minimum bet is 0.50 coins at a value of 0.01. The bet can be increased exponentially, and you can also choose a bet multiplier of up to 5 times. There are no paylines to select, so it's simply a matter of manually hitting or, if desired, auto-spinning once the desired bet is selected. The basic gameplay action relies on a bonus system that builds in intensity to offer big combination prizes. The RTP is generous, but the hit rate is not as much.\n\nTheme\n\nAstro Cat has an eclectic theme that blends Japanese anime, Asian culture and space exploration. The reels are framed in traditional Chinese style, and there are various Asian symbols, such as bonsai trees, koi carp, Chinese fans, and lucky frogs which are part of the paid icon assembly, along with real playing card symbols. The game's wild symbol is a Japanese anime-style cat, which appears on reels 3 and 4 and replaces all other symbols except the bonus.\n\nReelfecta system\n\nAstro Cat uses the Reelfecta system, where two 2x3 reels sit next to a 16-position grid reel in the center. The game's colossal reel set makes it appear more complicated than it is, but it mostly plays like a 5x3 reel slot, given the winning format.\n\nWild and scatter symbols\n\nThe Astro Cat wild symbol replaces all the symbols in the game, including the scatter symbol that triggers up to 13 free spins. The scatter symbol is a fireworks symbol, which only appears on the outer reels of the Reelfecta. Landing 5 or more of these on the same spin will trigger the Free Spins feature.\n\nFree spins\n\nThe Free Spins feature in Astro Cat rewards players with up to 13 free spins. During this feature, the +1 Wild Cat or the poison symbol appears on the Reelfecta. If a +1 Wild Cat symbol lands, an additional free spin is triggered, and the wild will be frozen in place. The feature can award up to 12 additional free spins. If the poison symbol appears, the feature ends, and the player receives a payout equivalent to 2 times the bet. It is guaranteed that you will not receive a poison symbol in the first three free spins. Filling 12 outer positions with Wild Cats will also fill the inner positions, creating 1 giant wild with 16 symbols. This triggers a Mega Spin with all the extra wilds in place.\n\nBet amounts\n\nAstro Cat allows players to bet from 0.50 coins at a value of 0.01 up to €1250. The bet can be increased exponentially, and players can also choose a bet multiplier of up to 5 times.\n\nPlayable devices\n\nAstro Cat is available on both mobile and desktop devices, and players can enjoy free play or play for real money.\n\nMega spin feature\n\nFilling 12 outer positions with Wild Cats will create 1 giant wild with 16 symbols, triggering a Mega Spin with all the extra wilds in place. This feature offers players the chance to hit big combination prizes.\n\n        \n            ",

Oh yes, we were missing space, this cat has a lot to do! At first glance, we were not sure if a designer had become a rogue or if this was a serious production of Lightning Box slot, as it seems that the eclectic theme is just part of the game's charm.\n\nAvailable on both mobile and desktop devices, both for free play and as a real money slot, this game clearly hopes to impress with its theme, gameplay, and innovative structure. Like the popular Druidess Gold slot machine from Lightning Box, Astro Cat uses the Reelfecta system, where two 2x3 reels sit next to a 16-position grid reel in the center. It seems a bit confusing, but mostly plays like a 5x3 reel slot, given the winning format.\n\nAstro Cat will take you on a journey to China with an 8 reel and 1296 ways to win slot from Lightning Box Games. A bonus feature is provided that rewards up to a dozen free spins complete with blocks and prizes paid up to 16 times thanks to the Reelfecta game engine. Play from 50 cents up to €1250 per spin.\n\nSpace Graphics\nI simply cannot explain the theme of this game, there is too much going on. The Astro Cat of the game's title forms the wild game and is clearly in some crazy cosmic adventure. For some reason, this game required a theme in some form of ancient Asian setting, so you get reels framed in traditional Chinese style, with a Japanese anime cat, and some fireworks as a bonus trigger.\n\nThere are also other Asian images in the rest of the reels, with bonsai trees, koi carp, Chinese fans, and lucky frogs that are part of the paid icon assembly. The rest of the payment symbols are completed by real playing card symbols and for that once we do not mind; if all the symbols on this giant reel set were tailor-made, I think we would be venturing too far.\n\nThe audio is good: it doesn't inspire, but it's hard to produce a single track to accommodate all the different styles; the sound effects are superb, and the animations and rendering are excellent. There is no doubt about the visual credentials of this game, or the care with which the production work has been handled, this is well away from the old Fortune 8 Cat slot game.\n\nThe images have a strong Asian touch - in addition to the lower value playing cards, there are fans, bonsai trees, a red fish, a green frog and a dragon. The Japanese anime-style cat is the game's wild - it only appears on reels 3 and 4 and replaces all other symbols except the bonus.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nWith a 1296 ways to win format, the minimum bet is 0.50 coins at a value of 0.01, this can be increased exponentially, and you can also choose a bet multiplier of up to 5 times. There are no paylines to select, so it's simply a matter of manually hitting or, if you're as lazy as me, auto-spinning once the desired bet is selected. The basic gameplay action is a bit silent, like many new online slot game titles, Astro Cat relies on a bonus system that builds in intensity to offer big combination prizes. The RTP is generous, the hit rate, on the other hand, is not as much.\n\nThe Astro Cat wild symbol replaces all the symbols in this game, including, very importantly, the game's scatter symbol that triggers up to 13 free spins. This may not seem like the luckiest number, however, wild symbols on the Reelfecta center reel are persistent or sticky, each time one appears it remains in place for the duration of the spins, also adding an extra spin as a re-trigger. If you fill the whole center box with wilds during the free spins, it can trigger a single mega spin. The symbol you don't want to see is the poisoned glass, marked by the ubiquitous skull and crossbones, this will immediately end the free spins.\n\nThe fireworks symbol is the bonus, which only appears on the outer reels of the Reelfecta. Landing 5 or more of these on the same spin will trigger the Free Spins feature, where you can see up to 12 free spins.\n\nOnce the free spins begin, keep an eye on the Reelfecta - starting from the top left outside position, a +1 Wild Cat or a poison symbol will appear. If you land the +1 Wild Cat, you will receive an additional free spin, and the wild will be frozen in place. Here, up to 12 additional free spins can be awarded.\n\nFill 12 outer positions with Wild Cats and you will also fill the inner positions - this creates 1 giant wild with 16 symbols. You will then receive 1 Mega Spin with all the extra wilds in place. If the poison appears, you will receive a payout equivalent to 2 times the bet, and the feature ends. It is guaranteed that you will not receive a poison in the first 3 free spins.\n\nThe unorthodox game engine and unusual Reelfecta feature make Astro Cat more complex than it really is.\nOther similar slot machines\nI recommend checking out Playtech, which offers many Chinese-themed slots such as Sun Wukong and Jade Emperor.\n            ",

Oh yes, we were missing space, this cat has a lot to do! At first glance, we were not sure if a designer had become a rogue or if this was a serious production of Lightning Box slot, as it seems that the eclectic theme is just part of the game's charm.\n\nAvailable on both mobile and desktop devices, both for free play and as a real money slot, this game clearly hopes to impress with its theme, gameplay, and innovative structure. Like the popular Druidess Gold slot machine from Lightning Box, Astro Cat uses the Reelfecta system, where two 2x3 reels sit next to a 16-position grid reel in the center. It seems a bit confusing, but mostly plays like a 5x3 reel slot, given the winning format.\n\nAstro Cat will take you on a journey to China with an 8 reel and 1296 ways to win slot from Lightning Box Games. A bonus feature is provided that rewards up to a dozen free spins complete with blocks and prizes paid up to 16 times thanks to the Reelfecta game engine. Play from 50 cents up to €1250 per spin.\n\nSpace Graphics\nI simply cannot explain the theme of this game, there is too much going on. The Astro Cat of the game's title forms the wild game and is clearly in some crazy cosmic adventure. For some reason, this game required a theme in some form of ancient Asian setting, so you get reels framed in traditional Chinese style, with a Japanese anime cat, and some fireworks as a bonus trigger.\n\nThere are also other Asian images in the rest of the reels, with bonsai trees, koi carp, Chinese fans, and lucky frogs that are part of the paid icon assembly. The rest of the payment symbols are completed by real playing card symbols and for that once we do not mind; if all the symbols on this giant reel set were tailor-made, I think we would be venturing too far.\n\nThe audio is good: it doesn't inspire, but it's hard to produce a single track to accommodate all the different styles; the sound effects are superb, and the animations and rendering are excellent. There is no doubt about the visual credentials of this game, or the care with which the production work has been handled, this is well away from the old Fortune 8 Cat slot game.\n\nThe images have a strong Asian touch - in addition to the lower value playing cards, there are fans, bonsai trees, a red fish, a green frog and a dragon. The Japanese anime-style cat is the game's wild - it only appears on reels 3 and 4 and replaces all other symbols except the bonus.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nWith a 1296 ways to win format, the minimum bet is 0.50 coins at a value of 0.01, this can be increased exponentially, and you can also choose a bet multiplier of up to 5 times. There are no paylines to select, so it's simply a matter of manually hitting or, if you're as lazy as me, auto-spinning once the desired bet is selected. The basic gameplay action is a bit silent, like many new online slot game titles, Astro Cat relies on a bonus system that builds in intensity to offer big combination prizes. The RTP is generous, the hit rate, on the other hand, is not as much.\n\nThe Astro Cat wild symbol replaces all the symbols in this game, including, very importantly, the game's scatter symbol that triggers up to 13 free spins. This may not seem like the luckiest number, however, wild symbols on the Reelfecta center reel are persistent or sticky, each time one appears it remains in place for the duration of the spins, also adding an extra spin as a re-trigger. If you fill the whole center box with wilds during the free spins, it can trigger a single mega spin. The symbol you don't want to see is the poisoned glass, marked by the ubiquitous skull and crossbones, this will immediately end the free spins.\n\nThe fireworks symbol is the bonus, which only appears on the outer reels of the Reelfecta. Landing 5 or more of these on the same spin will trigger the Free Spins feature, where you can see up to 12 free spins.\n\nOnce the free spins begin, keep an eye on the Reelfecta - starting from the top left outside position, a +1 Wild Cat or a poison symbol will appear. If you land the +1 Wild Cat, you will receive an additional free spin, and the wild will be frozen in place. Here, up to 12 additional free spins can be awarded.\n\nFill 12 outer positions with Wild Cats and you will also fill the inner positions - this creates 1 giant wild with 16 symbols. You will then receive 1 Mega Spin with all the extra wilds in place. If the poison appears, you will receive a payout equivalent to 2 times the bet, and the feature ends.
