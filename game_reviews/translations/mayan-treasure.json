Graphically speaking, this slot is impeccable, thanks in part to its large symbols that make gameplay easier. The game grid is located in front of an ancient temple entrance, supported by two pillars surmounted by statues of two panthers. Underneath, you can find updates on your winnings, the bet selector, and other buttons. The musical composition is also excellent, featuring a jingle that's not at all invasive and can be disabled with the button on the left.\n\nGame Features\nThe traditional grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 20 fixed paylines at a cost of €0.10 per line. The game system follows a cascade structure, meaning symbols belonging to a winning combination disappear and are replaced by new symbols. This creates the potential for an infinite mechanism that only ends when you no longer get new paying combinations. \n\nWinning combinations form by matching identical symbols starting from the first reel and continuing to the right. If there are multiple combos on the same payline, only the highest will be rewarded. If there are combinations on multiple lines, the amounts will be added together.\n\nMayan Treasure also features the classic Autoplay function, with a range of choices that go from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 999 automatic spins. Quick Spin can also accelerate the fall of symbols, a highly recommended feature for those who don't want to wait too long.\n\nSpecial Symbols for Amazing Wins\nThere are nine base symbols, divided into remunerative and non-remunerative. The playing cards are positioned at the lowest step of this ranking. Much more substantial sums are instead paid out by thematic symbols: the smoking pot pays up to 10 times the bet, the two-headed snake up to 30, the dagger up to 50, the helmet up to 100, and the uroboros, the snake biting its own tail, is associated with the highest sums, up to 500 times the bet. \n\nMoving on to special symbols, the golden shield is the Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the panther, which is tied to the Bonus game. Three Scatter symbols reward us with 5 Free Spins, while four symbols give us 10 Free Spins or 15 when you land five.\n\nThe warrior is a special symbol that can only appear on the third reel.

Graphically speaking, this slot is impeccable, thanks in part to its large symbols that make gameplay easier. The game grid is located in front of an ancient temple entrance, supported by two pillars surmounted by statues of two panthers. Underneath, you can find updates on your winnings, the bet selector, and other buttons. The musical composition is also excellent, featuring a jingle that's not at all invasive and can be disabled with the button on the left.\n\nGame Features\nThe traditional grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 20 fixed paylines at a cost of €0.10 per line. The game system follows a cascade structure, meaning symbols belonging to a winning combination disappear and are replaced by new symbols. This creates the potential for an infinite mechanism that only ends when you no longer get new paying combinations. \n\nWinning combinations form by matching identical symbols starting from the first reel and continuing to the right. If there are multiple combos on the same payline, only the highest will be rewarded. If there are combinations on multiple lines, the amounts will be added together.\n\nMayan Treasure also features the classic Autoplay function, with a range of choices that go from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 999 automatic spins. Quick Spin can also accelerate the fall of symbols, a highly recommended feature for those who don't want to wait too long.\n\nSpecial Symbols for Amazing Wins\nThere are nine base symbols, divided into remunerative and non-remunerative. The playing cards are positioned at the lowest step of this ranking. Much more substantial sums are instead paid out by thematic symbols: the smoking pot pays up to 10 times the bet, the two-headed snake up to 30, the dagger up to 50, the helmet up to 100, and the uroboros, the snake biting its own tail, is associated with the highest sums, up to 500 times the bet. \n\nMoving on to special symbols, the golden shield is the Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the panther, which is tied to the Bonus game. Three Scatter symbols reward us with 5 Free Spins, while four symbols give us 10 Free Spins or 15 when you land five.\n\nThe warrior is a special symbol that can only appear on the third reel. In this case, all symbols on the third reel and the central line disappear and are replaced by all-new symbols.\n            ",

The game features a cascade structure, where winning combinations disappear and are replaced by new symbols. The game only ends when new paying combinations are no longer available. Winning combinations form by matching identical symbols from the first reel to the right. Autoplay and Quick Spin are additional functions available.\n\nSymbols and Their Values\n\nThere are nine base symbols in Mayan Treasure, divided into remunerative and non-remunerative. The playing cards are positioned at the lowest step of this ranking. Thematically appropriate symbols include the smoking pot, the two-headed snake, the dagger, the helmet, and the uroboros, with the latter paying out the highest sums. The payout for the uroboros is up to 500 times the bet.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nThe golden shield is the Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by the panther and is tied to the Bonus game. Three Scatter symbols reward the player with 5 Free Spins, four symbols give 10 Free Spins, and five symbols result in 15 Free Spins.\n\nFree Spin and Bonus Features\n\nMayan Treasure provides five, ten, or 15 Free Spins when three, four, or five Scatter symbols appear, respectively. The warrior is a special symbol that destroys all symbols on the third reel and the central line, replacing them with new symbols. This feature can only occur on the third reel and can result in significant payouts.\n\nVisual Design and Theme\n\nMayan Treasure is set in ancient Mexico and features symbols typical of pre-Columbian societies. The game grid is set in front of an ancient temple entrance, supported by two pillars surmounted by statues of two panthers. The graphics are impeccable, and the musical composition is excellent, with an option to disable the jingle. The game's large symbols make gameplay easier.\n\n        \n            ",

The Warrior is a special symbol that can only appear on the third reel and replaces all symbols on the third reel and the central line with new symbols.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe Scatter symbol, represented by the Panther, triggers the Bonus game when three or more symbols appear. Three Scatter symbols reward the player with 5 Free Spins, four symbols give 10 Free Spins, and five symbols give 15 Free Spins. During Free Spins mode, cascading wins happen more frequently. The Warrior symbol can also appear during Free Spins mode, leading to more significant wins.\n\n        \n            ",

Graphically speaking, this slot is impeccable, thanks in part to its large symbols that make gameplay easier. The game grid is located in front of an ancient temple entrance, supported by two pillars surmounted by statues of two panthers. Underneath, you can find updates on your winnings, the bet selector, and other buttons. The musical composition is also excellent, featuring a jingle that's not at all invasive and can be disabled with the button on the left.\n\nGame Features\nThe traditional grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 20 fixed paylines at a cost of €0.10 per line. The game system follows a cascade structure, meaning symbols belonging to a winning combination disappear and are replaced by new symbols. This creates the potential for an infinite mechanism that only ends when you no longer get new paying combinations. \n\nWinning combinations form by matching identical symbols starting from the first reel and continuing to the right. If there are multiple combos on the same payline, only the highest will be rewarded. If there are combinations on multiple lines, the amounts will be added together.\n\nMayan Treasure also features the classic Autoplay function, with a range of choices that go from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 999 automatic spins. Quick Spin can also accelerate the fall of symbols, a highly recommended feature for those who don't want to wait too long.\n\nSpecial Symbols for Amazing Wins\nThere are nine base symbols, divided into remunerative and non-remunerative. The playing cards are positioned at the lowest step of this ranking. Much more substantial sums are instead paid out by thematic symbols: the smoking pot pays up to 10 times the bet, the two-headed snake up to 30, the dagger up to 50, the helmet up to 100, and the uroboros, the snake biting its own tail, is associated with the highest sums, up to 500 times the bet. \n\nMoving on to special symbols, the golden shield is the Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the panther, which is tied to the Bonus game. Three Scatter symbols reward us with 5 Free Spins, while four symbols give us 10 Free Spins or 15 when you land five.\n\nThe warrior is a special symbol that can only appear on the third reel. In this case, all symbols on the third reel and the central line disappear and are replaced by all-new symbols.\n            ",

Much more substantial sums are instead paid out by thematic symbols: the smoking pot pays up to 10 times the bet, the two-headed snake up to 30, the dagger up to 50, the helmet up to 100, and the uroboros, the snake biting its own tail, is associated with the highest sums, up to 500 times the bet. \n\nMoving on to special symbols, the golden shield is the Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the panther, which is tied to the Bonus game. Three Scatter symbols reward us with 5 Free Spins, while four symbols give us 10 Free Spins or 15 when you land five.\n\nThe warrior is a special symbol that can only appear on the third reel. In this case, all symbols on the third reel and the central line disappear and are replaced by all-new symbols.\n        ",

The warrior should be the focal point of the image and should be depicted in a pose that suggests victory or triumph. In the background, include a temple entrance with two pillars, one on each side of the warrior. Place the panther scatter symbol somewhere in the image to represent the game's bonus feature. Use vibrant colours such as green, purple, blue, and gold to create a lively and upbeat atmosphere. Make sure the overall design is eye-catching and memorable, with a focus on the fun and adventurous spirit of the game."
