If you ask anyone what the first symbols that come to mind are, the answer will often be the same: bells, the BAR symbol, the number 7, and fruit.\n\nThis popularity is due to the symbols that crowded the first slot machines, and while the first three have fallen out of use, fruit continues to be widely used today.

The sound component offers a rhythmic music that can accompany us during the game. Given the little variety of this melody, some players may prefer to disable it after a few minutes of playing, and fortunately, the slot itself provides this feature.\n\nFrom a visual point of view, Bomber Fruit from Capecod is a triumph of colors without appearing tasteless and straining the player's eyes. The fruits that occupy the game grid are a real fruit salad: plums, watermelons, mandarins, lemons, grapes, raspberries, and cherries.\n\nThis variety of fruit could complicate the life of those who want to remember from the beginning what the best combinations are, as there are no classic playing cards (A, K, Q...) to occupy the lowest positions in the scale of winnings. \n\nDespite this, we are definitely faced with a well-thought-out and tasteful slot game, with captivating animations without losing the simplicity we expect from a fruit-themed slot.\n\nBomber Fruit: How to Play? \n\nMoving on to the technical aspect of our review, we find ourselves facing an Italian-made slot that exploits the common 5*3 mechanism among online slots. The fifteen symbols that are thus shown in each play are lined up along the twenty-five paylines, making Bomber Fruit a slot that satisfies all the archetypes of online slots.\n\nThis allows us to immediately move on to the game without passing through a training phase to master the slot, as we can rely on the experience we have gained with other titles. \n\nThe RTP, reflecting the canons of Capecod, is slightly above 95%, a value that is not particularly high but still allows for a decent number of winnings, thanks especially to the special symbols: the bomb is a Wild symbol that can replace other symbols as a Joker, and the question mark is a possible multiplier on winnings.\n\nSlots Similar to Bomber Fruit \n\nCapecod itself, which we have extensively discussed, makes extensive use of fruit themes for its slots, as seen in Fruits, another title from this development house. Of course, all companies have one or more slots focused on fruit, such as Fruit Case from NetEnt, which uses a cascading gameplay that can provide linked winnings, or Fruits of the Nile from Playson, which offers a particular graphic style.\n            ",

Sweet juicy goodness flying everywhere! The fruit explodes when you hit it with a Bomber Fruit symbol, and that's always a great time. The game follows the common 5x3 mechanism, so experienced slot players will feel right at home.</p><p>One of the exciting features in this game is the Wild symbol, which allows for even more explosions. Not all wilds are exciting, but when they're in this game, they certainly are. Additionally, the game has a question mark multiplier, which can lead to some decent winnings. Just don't get too excited and blow up your computer when you hit the jackpot. It's not worth it.</p><p>The RTP is slightly above 95%, meaning that you have a decent chance to walk away with some extra cash. Or, at worst, you'll have spent some time playing a fun game and throwing some fruit bombs around. Either way, it's a win-win situation!</p>\"\n}"

If you ask anyone what the first symbols that come to mind are, the answer will often be the same: bells, the BAR symbol, the number 7, and fruit.\n\nThis popularity is due to the symbols that crowded the first slot machines, and while the first three have fallen out of use, fruit continues to be widely used today. It is not surprising to find fruit-themed slots like Bomber Fruit from Capecod in order to enrich the game screen with freshness and colors.\n\nLet's discover it together. \n\nBomber Fruit: Visual and Sound Aspect \n\nLet us begin our review by talking about how Bomber Fruit appears once opened. The sound component offers a rhythmic music that can accompany us during the game. Given the little variety of this melody, some players may prefer to disable it after a few minutes of playing, and fortunately, the slot itself provides this feature.\n\nFrom a visual point of view, Bomber Fruit from Capecod is a triumph of colors without appearing tasteless and straining the player's eyes. The fruits that occupy the game grid are a real fruit salad: plums, watermelons, mandarins, lemons, grapes, raspberries, and cherries.\n\nThis variety of fruit could complicate the life of those who want to remember from the beginning what the best combinations are, as there are no classic playing cards (A, K, Q...) to occupy the lowest positions in the scale of winnings. \n\nDespite this, we are definitely faced with a well-thought-out and tasteful slot game, with captivating animations without losing the simplicity we expect from a fruit-themed slot.\n\nBomber Fruit: How to Play? \n\nMoving on to the technical aspect of our review, we find ourselves facing an Italian-made slot that exploits the common 5*3 mechanism among online slots. The fifteen symbols that are thus shown in each play are lined up along the twenty-five paylines, making Bomber Fruit a slot that satisfies all the archetypes of online slots.\n\nThis allows us to immediately move on to the game without passing through a training phase to master the slot, as we can rely on the experience we have gained with other titles. \n\nThe RTP, reflecting the canons of Capecod, is slightly above 95%, a value that is not particularly high but still allows for a decent number of winnings, thanks especially to the special symbols: the bomb is a Wild symbol that can replace other symbols as a Joker, and the question mark is a possible multiplier on winnings.\n\nSlots Similar to Bomber Fruit \n\nCapecod itself, which we have extensively discussed, makes extensive use of fruit themes for its slots, as seen in Fruits, another title from this development house. Of course, all companies have one or more slots focused on fruit, such as Fruit Case from NetEnt, which uses a cascading gameplay that can provide linked winnings, or Fruits of the Nile from Playson, which offers a particular graphic style.\n            ",
