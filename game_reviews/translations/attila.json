The paylines number ten, and the bonuses include the traditional Scatter and Wild, as well as the high-adrenaline Risk feature.

The symbols referring to the playing cards from 9 to Q pay the least, up to 125 times your bet if they appear on all five reels. Ace and King, on the other hand, range from a minimum of 20 times with 3 symbols to a maximum of 150 if they appear on all five reels. Arrows and axes pay 250 times, archers 500, and horse and foot warriors up to 1,000.

Attila also has Wild value and can replace all other symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by the symbol of the Hunnic army with the flames of conquered villages in the background. Three Scatter symbols entitle you to 16 Free Spins, with the chance to multiply your winnings by 3. After each win, you can activate the Risk feature. In this case, a flipped card will appear on the gameplay, and we must decide whether it's red or black. If the answer is correct, we'll double the winnings and can continue to risk further.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Structure\n\nAttila has a classic gameplay structure consisting of five reels and three rows, with a minimum bet of 1 token and a maximum of 100 tokens. The paylines number ten.\n\nBonuses\n\nAttila offers the traditional Scatter and Wild bonuses, as well as the high-adrenaline Risk feature. Three Scatter symbols entitle you to 16 Free Spins, with the chance to multiply your winnings by 3. After each win, you can activate the Risk feature, which gives you the chance to double your earnings.\n\nSymbols and Values\n\nAttila features thematic and non-thematic symbols of different values. The symbols referring to the playing cards from 9 to Q pay the least, while the horse and foot warriors pay up to 1,000 times. The symbol that pays the most is Attila himself: if it appears twice, it pays 20 times the bet, but if it appears five times, then you must multiply by 10,000! Attila also has Wild value and can replace all other symbols except the Scatter.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nAlthough it lacks particular bonus features, Attila offers the chance to win substantial sums, paying up to 10,000 times your bet. With a minimum bet of 1 token and a maximum bet of 100, players can aim for significant wins. Even though the number of paylines is limited to ten, the bonuses and high winning potential make up for it.\n\nGraphics\n\nAttila's graphics are straightforward, with no over-the-top animations and symbols that only depict the great Hunnic leader and his army of archers, knights, and foot soldiers. The game screen features boxes showing the bet amount, the number of spins you've chosen to make, and the paylines. The game's aesthetics are appealing and immersive, with an appropriate selection of images and a color palette that transports the player to a historical period.\n\n        \n            ",

As the ruler of the Huns, he managed to defeat and subdue peoples throughout half of Europe, from Greece to Germany. The graphics of this slot are straightforward, with no over-the-top animations and symbols that only depict the great Hunnic leader and his army of archers, knights, and foot soldiers. At the bottom of the game screen, you'll find the boxes showing the bet amount, the number of spins you've chosen to make, and the paylines. Next to them are the Auto button for automatic reel rotation and the Start button, which allows us to play independently. Clicking on the question mark symbol takes you to the paytable. \n\nKey features of the slot\nAttila has a classic gameplay structure consisting of five reels and three rows, with a minimum bet of 1 token and a maximum of 100 tokens. The paylines number ten, and the bonuses include the traditional Scatter and Wild, as well as the high-adrenaline Risk feature. Even though it lacks particular bonus features, Attila offers the chance to win substantial sums, paying up to 10,000 times your bet. We recommend it to players who, although not very experienced, aspire to wins of a certain level!\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Attila\nAttila features thematic and non-thematic symbols of different values. The symbols referring to the playing cards from 9 to Q pay the least, up to 125 times your bet if they appear on all five reels. Ace and King, on the other hand, range from a minimum of 20 times with 3 symbols to a maximum of 150 if they appear on all five reels. Arrows and axes pay 250 times, archers 500, and horse and foot warriors up to 1,000. The symbol that pays the most is, of course, Attila himself: if it appears twice, it pays 20 times the bet, but if it appears five times, then you must multiply by 10,000! Attila also has Wild value and can replace all other symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by the symbol of the Hunnic army with the flames of conquered villages in the background. Three Scatter symbols entitle you to 16 Free Spins, with the chance to multiply your winnings by 3. After each win, you can activate the Risk feature. In this case, a flipped card will appear on the gameplay, and we must decide whether it's red or black. If the answer is correct, we'll double the winnings and can continue to risk further. Otherwise, the Risk feature will end, the winnings will be reset to zero, and we'll return to playing on the reels.\n        ",
