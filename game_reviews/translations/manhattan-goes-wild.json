With five reels and consecutive wins on 243 paylines, this slot can surprise you with a wild symbol that turns other symbols wild and stacks them on full reels. A bonus feature offers free spins and a meter that can trigger additional spins. Enter the high life of Manhattan and play for a chance to win up to 20,000x in the Manhattan Goes Wild slot.\nA Swanky Graphics Design\nNolimit City's slot experts take us straight to the golden days of New York, when the Empire State and Chrysler buildings were still fresh and shining in all their glory. The artists behind the game have done their job, as can be inferred from the art deco style that pervades the slot's design. But it's not just art - it's the feeling of all things new. It was the 1930s and that look and feel is communicated in the Manhattan Goes Wild slot. The game has three rows, five reels, and 243 ways to win, with a supercharged wild symbol that gives it its name and a bonus feature that can retrieve more spins. All in all, Manhattan Goes Wild is a party in the city, the way it was depicted in Blake Edwards' films, and this sport is closely associated with money, so the game has a maximum payout of 20,000x that can result from a single spin.\n\nThe background tells everything about the identity of this release. The reel adventure is set in the world's greatest city (according to New Yorkers) whose landscape was dominated by absolutely stunning architecture that was still new and awe-inspiring in the thirties. The Manhattan Goes Wild slot has received enough attention to detail to define this game as a unique one in its kind. Although none of the symbols have been launched in 3D animation, they receive a cascade of lights and sparkles when they are part of a winning result. A lively jazz musical theme adds a perfect touch to the gameplay, as you will never dare to turn off the sound for this online slot experience.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of Slot Machine\nManhattan Goes Wild is an online slot machine with five reels and three rows with an RTP of 96.16% and high volatility. There are 243 ways to win so you won't have to worry about customizing paylines. The token per line ratio is locked at 1-1, but you can select overall bet values from 0.10 to 100 for each spin. This wide range of bets allows newbies and casual gamers to enjoy this slot, but it's also great for veterans and mid-level players. The Autoplay feature is highly customizable and you can set win and loss limits as well as the number of automatic spins.\n\nPayments in the game are made with three or more symbols of the same type that fall successively on the reel-set. The symbols are made up of a high-paying category represented by a series of image symbols and a low-paying category, which are the high cards (10 to ace). There are three symbols that have the same amount, which is the highest on the paytable. These are the Wild symbol and those of Bugsy and Betty, which pay 5x on the winning bet or €5.00 for a one euro bet and €500.00 for the highest bet of €100.00 per spin. The lady singing on the microphone pays 3x, the hot machine pays 2.5x, and the diamond earring pays 2x. The Wild is the most important symbol as it can replace any other, except for the scatter, and 'infect' the Bugsy and Betty symbols to become golden wilds.\n\nThe scatters that appear in three or more positions start the Manhattan Freespins bonus. During the bonus, only high-yield symbols are collected in the 243 Win Ways counter. When it fills up, the selected symbol becomes a golden wild for that spin and assigns an extra spin. Bugsy and Betty symbols award three extra spins, but require 10 symbols instead of 8 for all others that grant extra spins. These features do not guarantee a win, but during our review of the Manhattan Goes Wild slot, we found that they usually do. Land the cocktail glass scatter symbol in three or more positions anywhere to activate the Manhattan Spins bonus. It's a free spin tailspin during which all high-yielding symbols are added to the win counters. Once a meter is full, that symbol becomes an extra wild for the rest of the round, adding another spin to the total.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you're looking for more city-based games, there's nothing better than Portomaso Gaming's New York New York video slot. Symbols include the Brooklyn Bridge, a yellow cab, and the Wall Street bull sculpture. Saucify's Tails of New York, on the other hand, features a variety of four-legged friends that trigger free games and wild payout multipliers."

With five reels and consecutive wins on 243 paylines, this slot can surprise you with a wild symbol that turns other symbols wild and stacks them on full reels. A bonus feature offers free spins and a meter that can trigger additional spins. Enter the high life of Manhattan and play for a chance to win up to 20,000x in the Manhattan Goes Wild slot.\nA Swanky Graphics Design\nNolimit City's slot experts take us straight to the golden days of New York, when the Empire State and Chrysler buildings were still fresh and shining in all their glory. The artists behind the game have done their job, as can be inferred from the art deco style that pervades the slot's design. But it's not just art - it's the feeling of all things new. It was the 1930s and that look and feel is communicated in the Manhattan Goes Wild slot. The game has three rows, five reels, and 243 ways to win, with a supercharged wild symbol that gives it its name and a bonus feature that can retrieve more spins. All in all, Manhattan Goes Wild is a party in the city, the way it was depicted in Blake Edwards' films, and this sport is closely associated with money, so the game has a maximum payout of 20,000x that can result from a single spin.\n\nThe background tells everything about the identity of this release. The reel adventure is set in the world's greatest city (according to New Yorkers) whose landscape was dominated by absolutely stunning architecture that was still new and awe-inspiring in the thirties. The Manhattan Goes Wild slot has received enough attention to detail to define this game as a unique one in its kind. Although none of the symbols have been launched in 3D animation, they receive a cascade of lights and sparkles when they are part of a winning result. A lively jazz musical theme adds a perfect touch to the gameplay, as you will never dare to turn off the sound for this online slot experience.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of Slot Machine\nManhattan Goes Wild is an online slot machine with five reels and three rows with an RTP of 96.16% and high volatility. There are 243 ways to win so you won't have to worry about customizing paylines. The token per line ratio is locked at 1-1, but you can select overall bet values from 0.10 to 100 for each spin. This wide range of bets allows newbies and casual gamers to enjoy this slot, but it's also great for veterans and mid-level players. The Autoplay feature is highly customizable and you can set win and loss limits as well as the number of automatic spins.\n\nPayments in the game are made with three or more symbols of the same type that fall successively on the reel-set. The symbols are made up of a high-paying category represented by a series of image symbols and a low-paying category, which are the high cards (10 to ace). There are three symbols that have the same amount, which is the highest on the paytable. These are the Wild symbol and those of Bugsy and Betty, which pay 5x on the winning bet or €5.00 for a one euro bet and €500.00 for the highest bet of €100.00 per spin. The lady singing on the microphone pays 3x, the hot machine pays 2.5x, and the diamond earring pays 2x. The Wild is the most important symbol as it can replace any other, except for the scatter, and 'infect' the Bugsy and Betty symbols to become golden wilds.\n\nThe scatters that appear in three or more positions start the Manhattan Freespins bonus. During the bonus, only high-yield symbols are collected in the 243 Win Ways counter. When it fills up, the selected symbol becomes a golden wild for that spin and assigns an extra spin. Bugsy and Betty symbols award three extra spins, but require 10 symbols instead of 8 for all others that grant extra spins. These features do not guarantee a win, but during our review of the Manhattan Goes Wild slot, we found that they usually do. Land the cocktail glass scatter symbol in three or more positions anywhere to activate the Manhattan Spins bonus. It's a free spin tailspin during which all high-yielding symbols are added to the win counters. Once a meter is full, that symbol becomes an extra wild for the rest of the round, adding another spin to the total.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you're looking for more city-based games, there's nothing better than Portomaso Gaming's New York New York video slot. Symbols include the Brooklyn Bridge, a yellow cab, and the Wall Street bull sculpture. Saucify's Tails of New York, on the other hand, features a variety of four-legged friends that trigger free games and wild payout multipliers.\n            ",

It has an RTP of 96.16%, and the Autoplay feature is customizable. The slot has a wide range of bets from 0.10 to 100 per spin, making it appropriate for gamers of all levels. The game features a unique wild symbol that becomes infectious among other symbols and is stacked on full reels. The bonus feature offers free spins and an extra-spin meter that can be triggered for additional spins. The maximum payout for this slot is 20,000x on a single spin.\n\nDesign and Theme of the Game\n\nManhattan Goes Wild by Nolimit City is an online slot machine that takes us back to the golden days of New York City in the 1930s. The slot has a three-row, five-reel configuration with a supercharged wild symbol that gives it its name. With a backdrop of the stunning architecture of New York City, the art deco style and the lively jazz tune that accompanies the gameplay, the game pulls us into the world of the US's most famous city.\n\nCustomization and Suitability for Different Players\n\nManhattan Goes Wild has a wide range of bets from 0.10 to 100 per spin, making it appropriate for gamers of all levels. As the token per line ratio is locked at 1-1, customizing paylines is not an issue. The Autoplay feature is customizable, and win and loss limits can be set, as well as the number of automatic spins. The game's high volatility may deter novice players, but the possibility of landing the 20,000x jackpot on a single spin is an incentive worth considering.\n\nAutoplay Feature and RTP Percentage\n\nManhattan Goes Wild has an RTP of 96.16% and a customizable Autoplay feature. The number of automatic spins, win, and loss limits is also adjustable.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols and Their Functions\n\nThe slot's wild symbol is the most crucial symbol as it can replace all other symbols, except the scatter, and it can contaminate Bugsy and Betty symbols, morphing them into golden wilds. Scatters trigger the Manhattan Freespins bonus when landing on three or more positions anywhere. During this bonus, high-yielding symbols are accumulated in the 243 Win Ways counter, and once it is full, the associated symbol becomes a golden wild and awards an additional spin.\n\nManhattan Freespins and Manhattan Spins Bonus Features\n\nThe Manhattan Goes Wild slot has two bonus features. The first is the Manhattan Freespins bonus, triggered by landing three or more scatters in any position. During the bonus, high-yielding symbols are accumulated in the win ways counter until it is full. The corresponding symbol becomes a golden wild, and an additional spin is awarded. The second feature is the Manhattan Spins bonus, triggered by landing three or more cocktail glass scatter symbols anywhere. All high-yielding symbols are collated in win counters, and once the meter is full, the corresponding symbol becomes a permanent wild throughout the round and a further spin is awarded.\n\nComparison with Other City-based Slot Games\n\nIf you are interested in city-based games, Portomaso Gaming's New York New York slot features symbols inspired by iconic New York landmass and Saucify's Tails of New York features various four-legged friends that award free games and wild payout multipliers. Manhattan Goes Wild, however, has a unique design with an infectious wild symbol and bonus features that set it apart from other city-based games.\n\n        \n            ",

Since paylines are locked at 243 ways to win, players won't have to worry about customizing them.\n\nSymbol Combinations for Payouts\n\nThe symbols are made up of a high-paying category represented by a series of image symbols and a low-paying category, which are the high cards (10 to ace). There are three symbols that have the same amount, which is the highest on the paytable. These are the Wild symbol and those of Bugsy and Betty, which pay 5x on the winning bet or €5.00 for a one euro bet and €500.00 for the highest bet of €100.00 per spin.\n\nComparison to Other City-based Slot Games\n\nOther city-based slot games players may be interested in include Portomaso Gaming's New York New York video slot that features symbols such as the Brooklyn Bridge, a yellow cab, and the Wall Street bull sculpture. Saucify's Tails of New York features a variety of four-legged friends that trigger free games and wild payout multipliers.\n\n        \n            ",

With five reels and consecutive wins on 243 paylines, this slot can surprise you with a wild symbol that turns other symbols wild and stacks them on full reels. A bonus feature offers free spins and a meter that can trigger additional spins. Enter the high life of Manhattan and play for a chance to win up to 20,000x in the Manhattan Goes Wild slot.\nA Swanky Graphics Design\nNolimit City's slot experts take us straight to the golden days of New York, when the Empire State and Chrysler buildings were still fresh and shining in all their glory. The artists behind the game have done their job, as can be inferred from the art deco style that pervades the slot's design. But it's not just art - it's the feeling of all things new. It was the 1930s and that look and feel is communicated in the Manhattan Goes Wild slot. The game has three rows, five reels, and 243 ways to win, with a supercharged wild symbol that gives it its name and a bonus feature that can retrieve more spins. All in all, Manhattan Goes Wild is a party in the city, the way it was depicted in Blake Edwards' films, and this sport is closely associated with money, so the game has a maximum payout of 20,000x that can result from a single spin.\n\nThe background tells everything about the identity of this release. The reel adventure is set in the world's greatest city (according to New Yorkers) whose landscape was dominated by absolutely stunning architecture that was still new and awe-inspiring in the thirties. The Manhattan Goes Wild slot has received enough attention to detail to define this game as a unique one in its kind. Although none of the symbols have been launched in 3D animation, they receive a cascade of lights and sparkles when they are part of a winning result. A lively jazz musical theme adds a perfect touch to the gameplay, as you will never dare to turn off the sound for this online slot experience.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of Slot Machine\nManhattan Goes Wild is an online slot machine with five reels and three rows with an RTP of 96.16% and high volatility. There are 243 ways to win so you won't have to worry about customizing paylines. The token per line ratio is locked at 1-1, but you can select overall bet values from 0.10 to 100 for each spin. This wide range of bets allows newbies and casual gamers to enjoy this slot, but it's also great for veterans and mid-level players. The Autoplay feature is highly customizable and you can set win and loss limits as well as the number of automatic spins.\n\nPayments in the game are made with three or more symbols of the same type that fall successively on the reel-set. The symbols are made up of a high-paying category represented by a series of image symbols and a low-paying category, which are the high cards (10 to ace). There are three symbols that have the same amount, which is the highest on the paytable. These are the Wild symbol and those of Bugsy and Betty, which pay 5x on the winning bet or €5.00 for a one euro bet and €500.00 for the highest bet of €100.00 per spin. The lady singing on the microphone pays 3x, the hot machine pays 2.5x, and the diamond earring pays 2x. The Wild is the most important symbol as it can replace any other, except for the scatter, and 'infect' the Bugsy and Betty symbols to become golden wilds.\n\nThe scatters that appear in three or more positions start the Manhattan Freespins bonus. During the bonus, only high-yield symbols are collected in the 243 Win Ways counter. When it fills up, the selected symbol becomes a golden wild for that spin and assigns an extra spin. Bugsy and Betty symbols award three extra spins, but require 10 symbols instead of 8 for all others that grant extra spins. These features do not guarantee a win, but during our review of the Manhattan Goes Wild slot, we found that they usually do. Land the cocktail glass scatter symbol in three or more positions anywhere to activate the Manhattan Spins bonus. It's a free spin tailspin during which all high-yielding symbols are added to the win counters. Once a meter is full, that symbol becomes an extra wild for the rest of the round, adding another spin to the total.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you're looking for more city-based games, there's nothing better than Portomaso Gaming's New York New York video slot. Symbols include the Brooklyn Bridge, a yellow cab, and the Wall Street bull sculpture. Saucify's Tails of New York, on the other hand, features a variety of four-legged friends that trigger free games and wild payout multipliers.\n            ",
