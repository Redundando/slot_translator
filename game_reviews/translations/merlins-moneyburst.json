Over the years, various slots have been dedicated to him, including Nextgen's Merlin's Moneyburst, which we will talk about today.\n\nWill the graphics and technical section of this slot manage to bewitch us? Let's find out together.\n\nMerlin's Moneyburst - Purple reigns supreme\nLet's start talking about the graphics aspect, because the eye also wants its part. The slot opens with a 3D model of Merlin disappearing, showing us the game grid made up of the classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q ...) all accompanied by eyes that look at the mouse pointer. \n\nA vaguely disturbing choice but one that shows attention to detail not to be underestimated. Other symbols we see are the eye in the flask, the magic grimoire, and the clawed ruby.\n\nFrom a sound point of view, on the other hand, we have faint music, almost a chorus to keep us company, interrupted from time to time by the sound of a drop of water or the cry of an owl: all to further emphasize the illusion of being in the middle of a forest, ready to witness one of the spells of the great wizard Merlin.\n\nMerlin's Moneyburst - Gameplay mechanics\nWe finally come to talking about the technical behavior and gameplay mechanisms of this slot: the grid that appears in front of us is certainly out of the ordinary. In fact, on the one hand, we find a 3 * 3 pattern that shows 9 symbols at each spin, with a small accessory grid to the left that shows another 4 symbols at each spin.\n\nThere are 60 paylines, which together with the RTP of 96.75%, balance out to a rather high volatility of the slot: we can therefore expect a good number of spins without winnings before obtaining one of interesting value, but less than other titles with high volatility.\n\nAmong the various symbols found in the grid, particular attention must be paid to two: Merlin is a Wild symbol capable of replacing all other normal symbols in the game like a common wild card, while the clawed gem is a Scatter symbol. Finding at least three in a single spin, we will have the opportunity to access the bonus mode (free spins with random Wilds) and therefore aim for a more substantial win.\n\nCertainly, the original aspect of the slot will intrigue many players, although a bit of practice will be necessary to master it.\n\nSlots similar to Merlin's Moneyburst\nMagic is a dear friend of online slots and several titles can be found that use this theme within them, such as Novomatic's The Magic Flute, Merkur Gaming's Magic Mirror Delux 2, or even Wazdan's Magic of the Ring Deluxe, although there are many more choices available.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics and layout\n\nMerlin’s Moneyburst has an unconventional grid layout that consists of a 3 * 3 pattern with nine symbols and another small accessory grid to the left with four symbols for each spin. The slot has 60 paylines, and its RTP is 96.75%. It has a high volatility that makes it expectable to have a good number of spins without a winning combination, but the win amount will be less than the other high volatility slot titles.\n\nPaylines, RTP, and volatility\n\nMerlin’s Moneyburst has 60 paylines, an RTP of 96.75%, and high volatility. The high volatility nature of the game means that it is expected to have a good number of unsuccessful spins, but the payout will still be less than other high volatility games.\n\nSymbols and their significance\n\nThe game has a variety of symbols, including Merlin, which is a wild symbol that can replace all others except the scatter. The other notable symbol is the clawed gem, which is the Scatter symbol. Players can access the Bonus mode and enjoy free spins with random wilds if they get at least three clawed gems on their reels. The other symbols include the classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q), an eye in a flask, a magic grimoire, and a clawed ruby.\n\nGraphics and sound effects\n\nMerlin's Moneyburst has splendid graphics and sound effects that add to the magic theme of the game. When the game opens, a 3D model of Merlin appears and disappears to show the game grid. The classic playing card symbols are accompanied by eyes that look at the mouse pointer - an intriguing visual detail. The background music is faint, almost like a chorus, accompanied by the sound of a drop of water or the cry of an owl to depict a forest-like scenario.\n\nTarget audience and overall impression\n\nMerlin's Moneyburst is a bit of an unconventional slot, so it requires some familiarization to get used to the gameplay mechanisms and the unusual grid layout. The game will enthrall those who love magic and fantasy-themed games. Overall, the game is enjoyable and has decent winning potential, given its high volatility nature. \n\n        \n            ",

Let's find out together.\n\nMerlin's Moneyburst - Purple reigns supreme\nLet's start talking about the graphics aspect, because the eye also wants its part. The slot opens with a 3D model of Merlin disappearing, showing us the game grid made up of the classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q ...) all accompanied by eyes that look at the mouse pointer. \n\nA vaguely disturbing choice but one that shows attention to detail not to be underestimated.

In fact, on the one hand, we find a 3 * 3 pattern that shows 9 symbols at each spin, with a small accessory grid to the left that shows another 4 symbols at each spin.\n\nThere are 60 paylines, which together with the RTP of 96.75%, balance out to a rather high volatility of the slot: we can therefore expect a good number of spins without winnings before obtaining one of interesting value, but less than other titles with high volatility.\n\nAmong the various symbols found in the grid, particular attention must be paid to two: Merlin is a Wild symbol capable of replacing all other normal symbols in the game like a common wild card, while the clawed gem is a Scatter symbol. Finding at least three in a single spin, we will have the opportunity to access the bonus mode (free spins with random Wilds) and therefore aim for a more substantial win.\n\nCertainly, the original aspect of the slot will intrigue many players, although a bit of practice will be necessary to master it.\n\nSlots similar to Merlin's Moneyburst\nMagic is a dear friend of online slots and several titles can be found that use this theme within them, such as Novomatic's The Magic Flute, Merkur Gaming's Magic Mirror Delux 2, or even Wazdan's Magic of the Ring Deluxe, although there are many more choices available.\n            ",

Other symbols we see are the eye in the flask, the magic grimoire, and the clawed ruby.\n\nFrom a sound point of view, on the other hand, we have faint music, almost a chorus to keep us company, interrupted from time to time by the sound of a drop of water or the cry of an owl: all to further emphasize the illusion of being in the middle of a forest, ready to witness one of the spells of the great wizard Merlin.\n\nMerlin's Moneyburst - Gameplay mechanics\nWe finally come to talking about the technical behavior and gameplay mechanisms of this slot: the grid that appears in front of us is certainly out of the ordinary. In fact, on the one hand, we find a 3 * 3 pattern that shows 9 symbols at each spin, with a small accessory grid to the left that shows another 4 symbols at each spin.\n\nThere are 60 paylines, which together with the RTP of 96.75%, balance out to a rather high volatility of the slot: we can therefore expect a good number of spins without winnings before obtaining one of interesting value, but less than other titles with high volatility.\n\nAmong the various symbols found in the grid, particular attention must be paid to two: Merlin is a Wild symbol capable of replacing all other normal symbols in the game like a common wild card, while the clawed gem is a Scatter symbol. Finding at least three in a single spin, we will have the opportunity to access the bonus mode (free spins with random Wilds) and therefore aim for a more substantial win.\n\nCertainly, the original aspect of the slot will intrigue many players, although a bit of practice will be necessary to master it.\n\nSlots similar to Merlin's Moneyburst\nMagic is a dear friend of online slots and several titles can be found that use this theme within them, such as Novomatic's The Magic Flute, Merkur Gaming's Magic Mirror Delux 2, or even Wazdan's Magic of the Ring Deluxe, although there are many more choices available.\n        ",
