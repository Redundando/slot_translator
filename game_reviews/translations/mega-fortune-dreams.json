The rest of the symbols are in line with the theme of the slot: wealth.\n\nFrom diamonds set in rings, handbags, and even in the symbols of playing cards, to precious stones in the Scatter symbol. Finally, expensive wristwatches and the inevitable bottles of champagne on ice.\n\nThe music that accompanies the slot is as relaxing as the sounds themselves, which are not annoying or out of context. A rather appreciated detail is that moving through the game options, we will hear the sound of jingling coins.\n\nNow it's time to talk about the technical side of this slot, so let's move on to the next point.\n\nMega Fortune Dreams - The Game Itself\n\nLike the always NetEnt-branded twin, in this case too we find ourselves in front of a 5 * 3 game grid with a rather limited number of paylines. If on paper this looks like a slot in line with the many titles available online, it is not without surprises with its special functions.\n\nAmong the various symbols to keep an eye on, we immediately find the Wild, a wild card capable of replacing the other normal symbols, which is represented by two palm trees. It is possible to find more than one of these symbols on the same screen, to the point that finding three and a Scatter symbol we will get a particularly appreciated Respin.\n\nThe bonus is represented by a kind of wheel of fortune and finding at least three we can take part in the Jackpot. There are four wheels involved and we will have the opportunity to get a win or to continue towards the innermost ring accompanied by higher winnings.\n\nThanks to the presence of various special symbols, our gaming experience will usually be characterized by a large number of wins, even if of reduced value, with the possibility of aiming for a jackpot that can change our lives.\n\nSlots similar to Mega Fortune Dreams\n\nIn case we were looking for slots on the same line, we definitely start our list with the already mentioned Mega Fortune. Other titles that make opulence their image are Golden Goose Genie's Gems by Microgaming, or even Pharaoh's Secret, in case we don't want to move too far from a tropical and Middle Eastern setting.\n            ",
