            "response": "Big Bot Crew is a thrilling game developed by Quickspin that takes place in a futuristic metropolis. You'll be helping a group of tech-savvy teenagers build a humanoid robot called BigBot while trying to win big with the best winning combinations and accumulate as many BigBot Respins as possible. The gameplay has 5 reels, 40 paylines, and 4 Bigbot Jokers that activate the Bigbot Respins feature to turn all 5 reels wild and help you win up to 5,203.2 times your bet. You can bet from €0.40 to €100 per spin on any device. Make sure to keep your eyes peeled for symbols on the screen that could lead to exciting surprises! \n\nThis slot machine features robotic symbols and space-age functions. The main symbols include 4 different gears, 2 robots, and the band of 3 teenage techies. Matsuo is the most rewarding symbol, giving you 7.5 times your bet for 5 on a payline. The Bigbot icon will help you unlock various prizes. Bigbot is the Wild and if you accumulate 5 on a payline, you'll earn 10 times your bet. Remember that it only appears on the 3 central reels and on all reels with 2 bonuses. It can also move around during regular gameplay and replace all symbols in the Bonus Bar.\n\nThere are also two extra features to look out for. The Bigbot Respins function is activated when 2 or more Bigbot Wilds land on the reels. The number of respins you get is equal to the number of complete Bigbot Jokers that appear in the triggering round. Each extra Wild Bigbot that lands gives you an additional respin. The Wild Bigbot stays on the reels and moves to the indicated reel at the start of each respin. The Free Spins function is activated when you get 3 Bonus Scatters anywhere on the reels. You'll get 8 free spins as your reward. Like in the Bigbot Respins function, the Wild Bigbot stays on the reels and moves to the indicated reels at the start of each free spin.\n\nThis slot machine game is perfect for tech enthusiasts who love building and construction. You'll have a blast playing and developing the unique humanoid prototype alongside the band while potentially winning incredible prizes of over 5000 times your bet. In conclusion, if you're an experienced gambler looking for exciting gameplay, Big Bot Crew is definitely worth a try!",

It features a sci-fi theme where players can help three tech-savvy teens create a humanoid robot prototype. The game features 5 reels and 40 paylines with the potential to multiply your bets up to 5,203.2 times your initial wager.\n\nGameplay and rules\n\nPlayers can bet between €0.40 and €100.00 per spin on Big Bot Crew, making it accessible to players of various budget levels. The Bigbot Wild icon unlocks numerous bonuses and prizes, and players can activate a Free Spins bonus when three Bonus Scatters land anywhere on the reels. The Bigbot Respins bonus activates when two or more Bigbot Wilds land on the reels, and each time a Wild Bigbot lands during this feature, players get an extra respin.\n\nSymbols and paytable\n\nThe symbols on the reels of Big Bot Crew include four differently colored gears, two robots, and the three tech whiz kids themselves. Matsuo is the most valuable symbol, rewarding a generous 7.5 times your original bet for landing five on a payline. The Bigbot Wild only appears on the three central reels and on all reels containing two Bonus symbols, and it can move positions during the standard game and replace all symbols on the Bonus Bar.\n\nBonuses and features\n\nBig Bot Crew is loaded with extra features, including the Bigbot Respins bonus and the Free Spins bonus. During the Bigbot Respins bonus, players earn respins corresponding to the number of complete Bigbot Wilds present in the triggering round. Each additional Wild Bigbot landing earns players an extra respin, with the Wild remaining on the reels and moving to the indicated reel at the start of each extra respin. During the Free Spins bonus, the Bigbot Wild remains on the reels and moves to the indicated reels for each spin.\n\nMaximum payout potential\n\nPlayers have the potential to win up to 5,203.2 times their initial wager on Big Bot Crew, making it a potentially lucrative game. Matsuo is the most valuable symbol, rewarding a generous 7.5 times your original bet for landing five on a payline. If you get lucky and accumulate five of the Bigbot Wilds on a payline, you'll earn an incredible 10 times your initial wager.\n\n        \n            ",

Big Bot Crew, the popular no-registration slot developed by Quickspin, brings you on an adventure that allows you to help the trio construct a humanoid robot by hitting the best winning combinations and raking in as many BigBot Respins as possible. The game features 5 reels and 40 paylines with the potential to multiply your bets up to a whopping 5,203.2 times your initial wager. \n\nThe four Jolly Bigbot symbols present in the game activate the Bigbot Respins feature, turning all 5 reels into Wild and increasing your chances to win big. Whether you're playing on a desktop or a mobile device, you can bet between €0.40 and €100.00 per spin. Keep a lookout for the various robot-themed symbols and functions, as they often contain hidden surprises that can make all the difference in your gaming experience.\n\nThe main symbols present on the reels of Big Bot Crew include four differently colored gears, two robots, and the three tech whiz kids themselves. Matsuo, the most valuable symbol, rewards a generous 7.5 times your original bet for landing five on a payline. The Bigbot Wild icon helps unlock numerous bonuses and prizes. If you get lucky and accumulate five of the Bigbot Wilds on a payline, you'll earn an incredible 10 times your initial wager. Keep in mind that the Bigbot Wild only appears on the three central reels and on all reels containing two Bonus symbols. It can also move positions during the standard game and replace all symbols on the Bonus Bar.\n\nExtra features abound in Big Bot Crew, including the Bigbot Respins bonus, which activates when two or more Bigbot Wilds land on the reels. The number of respins awarded corresponds to the number of complete Bigbot Wilds present in the triggering round. Each additional Wild Bigbot landing earns players an extra respin, with the Wild remaining on the reels and moving to the indicated reel at the start of each extra respin. The game also features a Free Spins bonus round, activated when three Bonus Scatters land anywhere on the reels. Players earn eight free spins, during which the Bigbot Wild remains on the reels and moves to the indicated reels for each spin.\n\nAll in all, Big Bot Crew has captivated players worldwide, drawing them into an immersive universe of parallel victories and free spins. Those with a passion for technology and an eye for construction are sure to enjoy this unique game while helping the trio create their one-of-a-kind humanoid robot prototype.
