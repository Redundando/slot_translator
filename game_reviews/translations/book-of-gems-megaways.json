La Skywind Group con Book of Gems Megaways ha affrontato la questione con la solita maestria, regalando un gioco altamente adrenalinico che non lascerà indifferenti gli amanti dell’intrattenimento online.\nLa grafica è particolarmente curata, anche se non è ricca di effetti speciali, un pregio per chi non vuole essere distratto da animazioni e suoni invadenti. I simboli però sono molto ben definiti, con colori brillanti e tempestati di pietre preziose. Lo sfondo è dato da un paesaggio desertico al tramonto su cui si stagliano due piramidi avvolte da una bufera di sabbia. La griglia di grandi dimensioni ha nella parte superiore il contatore Megaways che ad ogni giro ci dice quali sono le possibilità di vincita, mentre sul lato sinistro ci sono appena tre tasti: Start, Turbo, Autoplay.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nDi base la griglia ha 5 rulli e 3 righe che possono diventare 4 o 5 durante gli spin. Come da tradizione Megaways, i modi per vincere sono ben 3.125 grazie a combinazioni di simboli identici adiacenti da sinistra a destra. Sulla parte alta della griglia, a ogni giro vengono calcolate le possibilità di vincita in base al numero di simboli comparsi su ogni rullo. La puntata minima è di 0,35 €, la massima 35 €. Per quel che riguarda l’Autoplay, non c’è possibilità di impostare limiti di vincita o di perdita, né un numero predefinito di giri, semplicemente si clicca di nuovo sul tasto quando si decide di tornare alla modalità manuale. Un pulsante apposito ci permette poi di attivare il turbo, così che i rulli corrano in maniera più veloce. Il ritorno teorico al giocatore (RTP) è del 95%, mentre la volatilità è alta, si vince meno spesso ma in media grosse cifre.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nI simboli di basso livello sono le carte da gioco dal 10 all’asso, che pagano meno rispetto agli altri anche se le cifre non sono bassissime. Con l’anello e lo scarabeo, entrambi dorati, le somme cominciano a farsi importanti, mentre le vette si toccano con la piramide e l’esploratore.\nIl libro magico è il nostro simbolo speciale e ricopre la doppia funzione di Wild e Scatter. Nel primo caso sostituirà tutti i simboli presenti, se compare per 3 volte invece sarà Scatter, ricompensandoci con 10 giri gratuiti. Prima che il gioco Bonus cominci, il libro si aprirà e verrà scelto un simbolo casuale che in caso di combinazione vincente si espanderà su tutto il rullo. I Free Spins possono essere riattivati alle stesse condizioni del gioco regolare.\nNel caso non volessimo aspettare la comparsa di 3 simboli Scatter per avere i giri gratuiti, è possibile acquistarli a parte.\n",

With Book of Gems Megaways, Skywind Group has tackled the issue with the usual mastery, offering a highly adrenaline-fueled game that will not leave online entertainment lovers indifferent. \n\nThe graphics are particularly well done, although not rich in special effects, a plus for those who do not want to be distracted by invasive animations and sounds. However, the symbols are very well defined, with bright colors and studded with precious stones. The background is given by a desert landscape at sunset on which two pyramids stand out surrounded by a sandstorm. The large grid has the Megaways counter in the upper part which tells us the winning possibilities on every spin, while on the left side there are just three buttons: Start, Turbo, Autoplay. \n\nSlot features \n\nThe basic grid has 5 reels and 3 rows that can become 4 or 5 during spins. As per Megaways tradition, there are 3,125 ways to win thanks to combinations of identical adjacent symbols from left to right. At the top of the grid, the winning possibilities are calculated based on the number of symbols that appear on each reel. The minimum bet is €0.35 and the maximum is €35. As for Autoplay, there is no possibility of setting win or loss limits, nor is there a predetermined number of spins. Instead, you can simply click the button again when you decide to return to manual mode. A special button allows us to activate the turbo so that the reels spin faster. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95%, while the volatility is high. You win less often but in average huge sums. \n\nSymbols and functions \n\nThe low-level symbols are the playing cards from 10 to Ace, which pay less than the others even if the amounts are not very low. With the golden ring and scarab, the sums begin to become important, while the peaks are reached with the pyramid and the explorer. \n\nThe magic book is our special symbol and has the dual function of Wild and Scatter. In the first case, it will replace all the other symbols, but if it appears three times, it will be Scatter, rewarding us with 10 free spins. Before the Bonus game starts, the book will open and a random symbol will be chosen, which in case of a winning combination will expand to the entire reel. Free Spins can be reactivated under the same conditions as the regular game. If you don't want to wait for the appearance of 3 Scatter symbols to get the free spins, you can buy them separately.",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and Betting Options\n\nBook of Gems Megaways by Skywind Group features a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows that can expand to 4 or 5 during spins. As per Megaways tradition, there are 3,125 ways to win thanks to combinations of identical adjacent symbols from left to right. The minimum bet is €0.35 and the maximum is €35. The Autoplay function doesn't allow setting limits for wins or losses, but a turbo button can be activated to spin the reels faster.\n\nMegaways Feature\n\nBook of Gems Megaways features Megaways, a common slot game feature in which the number of winning possibilities is calculated based on the number of symbols appearing on each reel during each spin. The counter in the upper part of the grid shows the maximum number of winning possibilities on each spin.\n\nBonus Game and Special Symbols\n\nThe Book of Gems serves as both a Wild and Scatter symbol, replacing all other symbols on the reels and rewarding 10 free spins when appearing three times on the grid. Before the Bonus game starts, the book will open and a random symbol will be chosen, which will expand to the entire reel if a winning combination is formed. Free Spins can be reactivated under the same conditions as the regular game. In addition to the book symbol, the game features playing cards, a golden ring, scarab, pyramid, and an explorer symbol.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nBook of Gems Megaways has a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 95% and high volatility. While players may win less often, the average payouts are typically substantial.\n\nGraphics and Theme\n\nBook of Gems Megaways features impressive graphics, with symbols defined by bright colors and studded with precious stones. The game's desert landscape backdrop at sunset is complemented by two pyramids surrounded by a sandstorm, creating an immersive Ancient Egypt theme for online entertainment lovers.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Features\n\nBook of Gems Megaways features a large grid with 5 reels and 3 rows that can expand to 4 or 5 rows during spins. With Megaways mechanics, there are 3,125 ways to win combinations of identical adjacent symbols from left to right. The minimum bet is €0.35, and the maximum is €35. Players can choose between Start, Turbo, or Autoplay modes. The game has a high volatility level, meaning players win less often, but the average sums are more significant.\n\nMegaways Feature\n\nThe number of Megaways (winning possibilities) is calculated based on the number of symbols that appear on each reel, with a counter displayed at the top of the grid. Players can benefit from Megaways to increase their chances of winning more often with identical adjacent symbols.\n\nBonus Game\n\nThe Book of Gems Megaways game has a special book symbol that serves as both Wild and Scatter. If three Book symbols appear on the reels during the game, players will unlock the Bonus game and be rewarded with 10 free spins. The book will randomly choose a symbol that will expand to the entire reel in case of winning combinations. Players can also choose to buy free spins separately to avoid waiting for the Scatter symbols to appear.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nBook of Gems Megaways has a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 95%, and its volatility level is high, meaning players win less often but average huge sums of money when they do win. Players cannot set win or loss limits when using the Autoplay mode. \n\nGraphics and Symbols\n\nSkywind Group has done an excellent job with the graphics of Book of Gems Megaways. The symbols are well-defined, with bright colors and studded with precious stones. The background consists of a desert landscape at sunset with two pyramids standing out surrounded by a sandstorm. The playing cards from 10 to Ace are the low-level symbols, and the higher-level symbols are represented by the golden ring, scarab, pyramid, and explorer. The game has few special effects, but the graphics are still visually appealing.\n\n        \n            ",

With Book of Gems Megaways, Skywind Group has tackled the issue with the usual mastery, offering a highly adrenaline-fueled game that will not leave online entertainment lovers indifferent. \n\nThe graphics are particularly well done, although not rich in special effects, a plus for those who do not want to be distracted by invasive animations and sounds. However, the symbols are very well defined, with bright colors and studded with precious stones. The background is given by a desert landscape at sunset on which two pyramids stand out surrounded by a sandstorm. The large grid has the Megaways counter in the upper part which tells us the winning possibilities on every spin, while on the left side there are just three buttons: Start, Turbo, Autoplay. \n\nSlot features \n\nThe basic grid has 5 reels and 3 rows that can become 4 or 5 during spins. As per Megaways tradition, there are 3,125 ways to win thanks to combinations of identical adjacent symbols from left to right. At the top of the grid, the winning possibilities are calculated based on the number of symbols that appear on each reel. The minimum bet is €0.35 and the maximum is €35. As for Autoplay, there is no possibility of setting win or loss limits, nor is there a predetermined number of spins. Instead, you can simply click the button again when you decide to return to manual mode. A special button allows us to activate the turbo so that the reels spin faster. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95%, while the volatility is high. You win less often but in average huge sums. \n\nSymbols and functions \n\nThe low-level symbols are the playing cards from 10 to Ace, which pay less than the others even if the amounts are not very low. With the golden ring and scarab, the sums begin to become important, while the peaks are reached with the pyramid and the explorer. \n\nThe magic book is our special symbol and has the dual function of Wild and Scatter. In the first case, it will replace all the other symbols, but if it appears three times, it will be Scatter, rewarding us with 10 free spins. Before the Bonus game starts, the book will open and a random symbol will be chosen, which in case of a winning combination will expand to the entire reel. Free Spins can be reactivated under the same conditions as the regular game. If you don't want to wait for the appearance of 3 Scatter symbols to get the free spins, you can buy them separately.\n        ",
