Per quanto ancora non siamo amanti dei film nipponici o cinesi, non possiamo nascondere come la cucina del Giappone e quella cinese ci abbia conquistati un po’ tutti.\nPer questo le case di produzione di Slot Machine hanno pensato bene di cominciare a creare giochi d’azzardo di intrattenimento che risentissero un po’ di questa influenza dall’Est, con il loro alfabeto particolare pieno di segni e i loro dragoni. Se vuoi conoscere una Slot Machine del genere continua a leggere!\nLa grafica della Slot Machine\nLa grafica di Long Pao, la Slot prodotta da Net Entertainment con la sua griglia classica 5×3, non ci ha fatto impazzire per la sua bellezza. Sicuramente potrebbe essere la Slot perfetta per tutti quelli appassionati alla cultura orientale, con i suoi simboli dell’alfabeto giapponese, le spade katana e i classici personaggi dei cartoni animati nipponici.\nDobbiamo dire che tutti i simboli sono disegnati alla perfezione e i colori sono brillanti e accattivanti.\nAnche per quanto riguarda lo sfondo, le considerazioni sono più o meno le stesse. Ci troviamo all’interno di un classico tempio giapponese di quelli che si potrebbero vedere anche nei film. Le sfumature predominanti sono quelle del marrone e del viola, ma il contrasto con i simboli colorati di giallo, rosso e blu è molto interessante.\nPer quanto ti parleremmo della grafica tutto il giorno, ci sembra il caso di dire anche qualcosa sulle funzioni, che hanno la loro importanza perché ti permettono di vincere un sacco di soldi.\nSticky Wild e altre funzioni\nLong Pao di NetEnt è una classica Slot Machine 5×3 e, allo stesso modo, anche il numero di linee di pagamento è abbastanza classico e non dà alcuna sorpresa: si parla di 25 paylines. La cosa estremamente interessante è l’RTP. Non ti spiegheremo nel dettaglio di cosa si tratta, ma devi sapere che maggiore è il numero, maggiori sono le probabilità di vincere ad ogni giocata. Solitamente quasi tutte le Slot Machine hanno un RTP tra il 95.5% e il 96%. Incredibilmente, Long Pao ha quasi il 97% di payout. Potresti pensare che la differenza sia poca, ma non c’è niente di più falso: hai decisamente più probabilità di ottenere un guadagno nel corso di ogni giocata.\nOltre al simbolo Free Spins, con un dragone che ti permetterà di fare dei giri gratis della Slot Machine senza utilizzare il tuo denaro, c’è anche il Bonus Sticky Wild. Il Wild, già di per sé, è molto importante perché ti permette di sostituire il simbolo mancante all’interno di una linea di pagamento per ottenere una combinazione vincente. Quando è Sticky, poi, significa che rimane nei rulli nell’arco di più giocate, senza sparire dopo un giro di Slot Machine. Ti auguriamo di ottenerli spesso, perché coincidono con le grosse vincite.\nSlot Machine simili\nSe ti piace questo contesto asiatico, con spade e dragoni, può essere un’ottima idea giocare a Slot Machine tipo Silent Samurai prodotta da Playtech. Il payout è decisamente più basso di quello di Long Pao, ma si tratta comunque di una percentuale nella media di 95.8%. I simboli di quest’ultima Slot, comunque, ci sono piaciuti maggiormente per una più alta definizione.\n",

Even those who have not yet fallen in love with Japanese or Chinese films cannot deny how their cuisine has won over our hearts.\n\nThis influence from the East has now made its way into the world of slot machine production. Players can now enjoy games of chance with symbols from the Japanese alphabet, katana swords, and classic characters from Japanese cartoons.\n\nOne such game is Long Pao, produced by Net Entertainment. While the graphics on the classic 5x3 grid may not have impressed us with their beauty, they are perfect for fans of oriental culture. Each Japanese alphabet symbol, katana sword, and cartoon character is drawn to perfection with bright and captivating colors.\n\nThe background transports players to a classic Japanese temple with shades of brown and purple. However, the contrasting colors of yellow, red, and blue make for a fascinating visual experience.\n\nBut what's a slot machine without its functions? Long Pao has an RTP of almost 97%, which is higher than most slot machines, giving you more chances to win with each spin. It also features Sticky Wilds, which stay on the reels for multiple spins instead of disappearing after one. Land these and watch as your winnings grow!\n\nThere's also a Free Spins symbol featuring a dragon that allows you to spin the reels without using your own money. And for those who love Asian culture, Silent Samurai produced by Playtech is another great option with symbols of swords and dragons, even if the payout is slightly lower.\n\nExperience the thrill of Long Pao and enjoy a world of Asian influence in your slot machine games.",

The RTP stands at almost 97%, with a relatively high payout rate. Long Pao also features a Sticky Wild Bonus. The Wild is essential as it can replace a missing symbol in a payline to get a winning combination. When it is Sticky, it remains on the reels for several plays and does not disappear after one spin. \n\nBonus features\n\nLong Pao has some exciting bonus features that make it a popular slot machine. One of the most appealing is the Sticky Wild Bonus. The Wild is essential as it can replace a missing symbol in a payline to get a winning combination. When it is Sticky, it remains on the reels for several plays and does not disappear after one spin. This often results in big wins, so it's always worth keeping an eye out for the Sticky Wild Bonus. Aside from the Free Spins symbol that represents a dragon and allows you to play for free, there are no other notable bonuses.\n\nTheme and graphics\n\nLong Pao is a slot machine produced by Net Entertainment with an Asian influence. The symbols consist of Japanese alphabets, katana blades, and classic characters from Japanese cartoons. All symbols have been beautifully designed with bright and alluring colors. Although the graphics are not the most impressive we have seen, they are still perfect for all Eastern culture enthusiasts. Regarding the background, we find ourselves inside a classic Japanese temple with a predominant color palette of brown and purple contrasted with yellow, red, and blue symbols that make the game very engaging.\n\nWinning potential and RTP\n\nLong Pao has a high RTP, averaging almost 97%. This means that players have a greater chance of winning with each play, compared to other slot machines with an average RTP between 95.5% and 96%. The Sticky Wild Bonus feature also increases the chances of a big win. Although there are no other significant bonuses, the Sticky Wild Bonus can be extremely lucrative for players.\n\nSimilar slot recommendations\n\nIf players enjoy the Asian context, with swords and dragons, they might enjoy playing Silent Samurai, produced by Playtech, as a similar slot machine. Although the payout rate is lower than Long Pao, averaging 95.8%, the symbols are more defined, making it a popular alternative.\n\n        \n            ",

Although we may not be fans of Japanese or Chinese movies, we cannot deny that their cuisine has conquered us all. That's why Slot Machine production companies have started creating gambling games infused with this Eastern influence, with their unique alphabet full of symbols and dragons. If you want to get familiar with such a slot machine, keep reading!\n\nThe Graphics of the Slot Machine,\nThe graphics of Long Pao produced by Net Entertainment, with its classic 5×3 grid, did not impress us with its beauty. However, it is undoubtedly the perfect slot machine for all Eastern culture enthusiasts, with its Japanese alphabet symbols, katana blades, and classic characters from Japanese cartoons. All symbols are perfectly drawn with bright and alluring colors.\n\nRegarding the background, things are more or less the same. We find ourselves inside a classic Japanese temple, as seen in movies. The predominant shades are brown and purple, contrasted with yellow, red, and blue symbols that make it very interesting.\n\nWhile we could talk about graphics all day, it is essential to mention the functions, which are significant since they allow you to win a lot of money.\n\nSticky Wild and Other Functions,\nLong Pao by NetEnt is a classic 5×3 slot machine, and the number of paylines is also quite traditional, totaling 25 paylines. However, the RTP is extremely interesting, with almost a 97% payout rate. This means you have a greater chance of winning with each play, compared to other slot machines with an average RTP between 95.5% and 96%. \n\nAside from the Free Spins symbol, which represents a dragon that allows you to play the slot machine for free, there is also the Sticky Wild Bonus. The Wild is essential as it can replace a missing symbol in a payline to get a winning combination. When it is Sticky, it remains on the reels for several plays and does not disappear after one spin. Hopefully, you can get it often as it often results in big wins!\n\nSimilar Slot Machines,\nIf you enjoy the Asian context, with swords and dragons, you might want to consider playing similar slot machines such as Silent Samurai, produced by Playtech. Although the payout rate is lower than Long Pao, averaging 95.8%, the symbols are more defined, making it a popular alternative.\n            ",
