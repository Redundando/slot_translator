The game starts in a misty background that changes from day to night progressively. Foxium's Adelia features a magnificent orchestral sound, its animations are realistic, and its graphics are delicate, mysterious, and powerful. The inviting reels are ancient and carved inside a monastery made of stone, which will become Adelia's refuge. Moreover, the game's graphics quality is excellent, making it visually appealing, and it is available on all mobile devices without the need to download anything.\n\nSymbolism and Wins in Adelia\n\nThe slot has 14 symbols that assist players in Adelia's magical world. They include five superior magical objects, five lower cards, four Bonus Symbols- Adelia's scatter, bonus coins, and two wild symbols. The classic W wild symbol replaces others while the multiplier wild is a wild multiplier that appears stacked. A combo with the symbol on the 3rd reel increases the win from 2 to 5 times. The Adelia scatter is always stacked and can be found on the 2nd and 4th reel. Free spins start when four or more scatters are on the playing field, and they extend for two additional rounds when a new scatter appears. Finally, there are coins that upgrade classic symbols.\n\nWhat are the 3 Bonus Games in Adelia: the Fortune Wielder?\n\nThe first bonus game is Adelia Respin. It activates when three multiplier wilds show on the central reel in the main game. Multiplier wilds lock onto the central reel for the entire game duration in this feature. When a combo forms during the respin, another spin is launched until there is no combo. If the Adelia Respin appears with the free spins, the latter will be played after the Respin. The second feature is Free Spins Bonus Game, which players receive after getting four or more Adelia scatters. They can receive 10, 20, or 30 free spins. Each scatter that appears during the spins extends the gaming session by two additional rounds. The third bonus game is Symbol Upgrade, which is only available during the free spins game. Each coin that presents itself in a treasure chest opens up another bonus game. All combinations with the selected symbols are paid at their maximum potential. At the end of the game, a message displays the total amount won.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Adelia: The Fortune Wielder Slot\n\nAdelia: The Fortune Wielder is an excellent video slot with great graphics and an incredible soundtrack that creates an excellent gaming experience.
