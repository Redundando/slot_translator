As in the previous version, the graphics are very well cared for, although there are no three-dimensional animations or special effects, but we like it that way!\nThe four \"homeowners\" dogs are a Dachshund, a Yorkshire, a Pug, and a Rottweiler, all reproduced in a certainly cute way, for a relaxing and fun gaming atmosphere!\nThe reels are located inside a kennel placed in the usual lush garden delimited by a white fence, with the name of the slot standing out in the upper part of the grid, while at the bottom we find all the buttons for setting the game, including the \"info\" button that allows you to know the value of each symbol and understand what winnings you can get with the different combinations.\nRemember that it is always possible to play The Dog House Megaways in demo version, for free and without even having to register!\nMain features of the slot machine\nCompared to the previous version, in The Dog House Megaways we find an extra reel and the Megaways gaming system, which offers even more chances to win!\nThe grid is therefore composed of six reels and seven rows, and the reels are not \"fixed\" but change in size at every turn.\nThe betting range for The Dog House Megaways ranges from 20 cents up to a maximum bet of €100, which also satisfies the most daring players, with a token value ranging from 0.01 to 50 cents.\nThe highest prize that can be won with this slot is equal to 12,305 times the bet, but it will not be easy to win, because it is a slot machine characterized by a very high volatility. As for the theoretical return to the player (return to player or RTP), we must say that The Dog House Megaways proves to be an excellent game: with 96.55%, we are more than half a point above the average of most slot games.\nSymbols and special features of The Dog House Megaways\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of this very entertaining Pragmatic Play slot machine are the playing cards from 10 to Ace, a collar, a bone, a kennel, and, of course, the four dogs that are the protagonists of the game, which, among the regular symbols, are the ones that have the highest value.\nThe kennel is the Wild symbol, it has a jolly function, and can also pay in combination.\nWe then have the Bonus symbol that is also the Scatter of the game, activating the Free Spins mode, in which you will have to choose between the free spins option and the Adhesive Wild option.\n\nFAQ\nCan I win free spins on the Dog House Megaways slot without registration?\n\nCertainly. Simply land 3 bonus paws anywhere on the reels to win your selection of free spins.\n\nIs the Dog House suitable for beginners?\n\nYes, The Dog House is particularly recommended for beginners due to its very simple and entertaining gameplay and is the ideal slot machine for four-legged friends lovers even in Demo mode!

It features colorful and well-designed graphics, taking place in a cartoon-like setting where the protagonists are cute dogs of different breeds. The main difference from the previous version is the addition of the Megaways gaming system and a sixth reel, offering even more chances to win. The grid is composed of six reels and seven rows, and the reels change in size at every turn.\n\nBetting Range and Potential Prize\n\nThe betting range for The Dog House Megaways starts from 20 cents up to a maximum bet of €100, making it suitable for both low and high rollers. The token value ranges from 0.01 to 50 cents. The highest prize that can be won in the game is 12,305 times the bet. However, it is a high volatility slot machine, making it a challenge to win such a prize. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.55%, which is higher than the average of most slot games.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nThe kennel symbol is the Wild symbol and has a jolly function that can also pay in combination. The Bonus symbol is also the Scatter of the game, activating the Free Spins mode. Landing three bonus paws anywhere on the reels will win a selection of free spins.\n\nFree Spins Mode\n\nThe Free Spins mode is activated by landing three Bonus symbols on the reels. During the mode, players can choose between the free spins option and the Adhesive Wild option, adding extra excitement to the gameplay. More Bonus symbols can also retrigger the feature, allowing players to earn even more free spins.\n\nMegaways Gaming System\n\nThe Dog House Megaways utilizes the Megaways gaming system, which offers players even more chances to win with its various combinations of icons. The system is characterized by the changing size of the reels, offering players different ways to create winning combinations. The addition of the Megaways system adds an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay of The Dog House Megaways.\n\n        \n            ",
