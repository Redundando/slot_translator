È presente invece il simbolo Scatter, che premia anche quando compare sui rulli in posizioni non adiacenti, a differenza degli altri simboli, che devono essere allineati sempre da sinistra verso destra.\nSistema di puntate\nIl valore di ogni puntata su Just Jewels viene espresso in termini di “crediti” che valgono 0,01 € ciascuno. Su ogni linea di pagamento è possibile puntare fino a 100 crediti, per un totale di 1€: questo significa che puntando il massimo su ognuna delle nove linee di pagamento, l’importo sarà di soli 9 €.\nÈ possibile poi scegliere su quante linee di pagamento puntare, partendo da 1, poi 3, 5, 7, o 9. Il valore così modesto della scommessa massima non vi deve però far pensare che si tratti di una slot a cui non vale la pensa giocare se si ama rischiare cifre consistenti: per i giocatori più intrepidi infatti, come da tradizione in casa Novomatic, c’è sempre la possibilità di raddoppiare le vincite di qualsiasi importo tramite la funzione Gamble!\nInfine, è presente l’Autoplay, che consente di impostare il numero di giri e il valore della puntata, e lasciar girare i rulli in automatico, fino a quando la funzione non viene disattivata manualmente!\n",

The theme - gemstones - is a classic VLT slot subject, and Just Jewels seeks to replicate the feel of playing a physical, land-based slot with integrated buttons and authentic sound effects. The dark blue background and variously-shaped gems shimmering on the reels give the player a sense of having found their way to a treasure trove. With no special features to speak of, the gameplay is extremely straightforward, yet the game remains enjoyable and entertaining thanks to a return rate of over 95%. With a betting range of €0.01 to €9, Just Jewels is well suited to cautious or beginner players who prefer not to take high risks before getting a feel for the game.\n\nSymbols and their values\nSymbols in Just Jewels are all about celebrating riches in all their forms: alongside the gems, there are banknote bundles and the Euro logo, as well as gold bullion and sparkling tiaras studded with precious stones! Clearly, the values of these symbols vary: for example, emeralds and amethysts are each worth up to 15,000 coins, while rubies and sapphires pay up to 20,000 coins. The Euro logo symbol can pay up to 45,000 coins, though bundles of banknotes can go as high as 50,000 and the same goes for gold bullion. The game's most valuable symbols are the stunning, jewel-encrusted crowns, which can result in a staggering jackpot of 500,000 coins! There are no Wild symbols in Just Jewels. However, there is a Scatter symbol, which pays out even when not appearing in adjacent reels, unlike the other symbols, which must be aligned from left to right.\n\nBetting system\nEvery bet in Just Jewels is measured in \"credits,\" each one worth €0.01. Players can bet up to 100 credits on each payline, for a total of €1. This means that betting the maximum amount on all nine paylines results in a mere €9 wager. However, the modest cost of the maximum bet should not deter risk-takers from enjoying this slot, as there is always the Novomatic tradition of doubling winnings of any value with the Gamble feature! Finally, the Autoplay function allows players to set the number of spins and the value of the bet, to keep the reels spinning automatically until the function is manually deactivated.",

The gemstone theme is a classic in slot machines, and Just Jewels replicates this both visually, with actual integrated buttons, and with sound effects, to recreate the feeling of being in front of a land-based game. The dark blue background and various sparkling gemstones on the reels give you the sensation of having a treasure chest in front of you. \n\nThe gameplay is extremely simple, lacking any special features, but with a return of over 95% and decent wins, the game is still enjoyable and entertaining. The betting range is not particularly wide, with bets ranging from 0.01€ to 9€, making Just Jewels a perfect fit for cautious players and beginners who prefer not to risk too much before getting familiar with the game. \n\nSymbols and their value:\nThe symbols in Just Jewels represent wealth in all its forms, including gemstones, rolls of banknotes, the euro logo, gold bars, and dazzling tiaras set with precious stones. The value of the symbols, of course, varies. As for the gemstones, emeralds and amethysts are worth up to 15,000 tokens, while rubies and sapphires pay up to 20,000 tokens. The euro logo allows you to win up to 45,000 tokens, but a nice roll of banknotes can get you up to 50,000, as can a gold bar. \n\nThe ultimate prize, however, goes to the incredibly expensive crowns encrusted with precious gems. Representing the highest paying symbol in the game, these can win you the jackpot of 500,000 tokens!\n\nWild symbols are absent from Just Jewels, so there is no symbol that can substitute for others to complete a winning combination. The game does have Scatter symbols, however, which offer rewards even when they appear on the reels in non-adjacent positions, unlike the other symbols, which must always be aligned from left to right. \n\nBetting system:\nThe value of every bet in Just Jewels is expressed in terms of \"credits,\" each of which is worth 0.01€. You can bet up to 100 credits on each payline, for a total of 1€. This means that if you bet the maximum on all nine paylines, your total bet will only be 9€. \n\nYou can also choose how many paylines to activate, starting from 1, then 3, 5, 7, or 9. Don't let the low maximum bet value fool you into thinking that this is a slot not worth playing if you enjoy taking big risks. For more daring players, as is the tradition with Novomatic games, the Gamble feature allows you to double your winnings, regardless of the amount. \n\nFinally, there's the Autoplay feature, which allows you to set the number of spins and the value of your bet, and automatically spins the reels until the function is manually turned off. \n\nOverall, Just Jewels is a visually appealing and enjoyable game for all types of players, from beginners to experienced gamblers.\n            ",

The game features a theme of precious gems, which can be seen both visually and aurally. The reels are surrounded by actual buttons, and the sound effects recreate the experience of playing on a land-based slot machine. The gemstones floating on the dark blue background create a treasure-chest-like atmosphere.\n\nSymbols and Jackpot\n\nJust Jewels features symbols that represent various forms of wealth, such as gemstones, bankrolls, gold bars, and tiaras. The gemstones, including emeralds, amethysts, rubies, and sapphires, are worth up to 15,000 and 20,000 tokens, respectively. The euro logo can reward you with up to 45,000 tokens, while banknotes and gold bars can get you as high as 50,000 tokens. The highest paying symbols are the dazzling tiaras encrusted with precious gems that can win you the jackpot of 500,000 tokens. There are no wild symbols in this game, but scatter symbols offer a chance for rewards even when appearing on non-adjacent reels.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nJust Jewels does not have any special features other than the gamble feature, which allows players to double their winnings regardless of the amount. There are no wild symbols either. The absence of special features might detract some players, but others who appreciate simple gameplay may find it entertaining. \n\nBetting Range\n\nThe betting range in Just Jewels is relatively conservative, ranging from 0.01€ to 9€. You can bet up to 100 credits on each of the nine paylines for a total of 1€. This means that the game is suitable for players who prefer not to place large bets without compromising the excitement factor. However, the gamble feature does offer a chance for more daring players to double their winnings.\n\nVisuals and Gameplay\n\nJust Jewels boasts stunning visuals with its gemstone theme, and the dark blue background creates a treasure-chest-like ambiance. The lack of special features is compensated for with exciting visuals and enjoyable gameplay. The game does offer an autoplay feature, which spins the reels automatically and allows you to set a specific number of spins and bet value. Overall, this is an engaging game that can provide endless entertainment to both new and experienced players.\n\n        \n            ",

The game replicates the classic gemstone theme visually, but stands out with actual integrated buttons and sound effects.\n\nSymbols\n\nJust Jewels' symbols represent wealth in all its forms, with gemstones, rolls of banknotes, the euro logo, gold bars, and dazzling tiaras set with precious stones. While the gemstones provide the lowest payouts of up to 15,000tokens, crowns encrusted with precious gems offer the highest paying symbol in the game as well as a chance to win the jackpot of 500,000 tokens.\n\nJackpot\n\nThe highest payout in Just Jewels is the coveted jackpot of 500,000 tokens that can be won with the crowns encrusted with precious gems. While no Wild symbol is present, Scatter symbols offer rewards even when they appear on the reels in non-adjacent positions. \n\nSpecial Features\n\nJust Jewels lacks any special feature, but the Gamble feature allows daring players to double their winnings regardless of the amount, providing a thrilling experience for those who prefer high-risk options. Additionally, the Autoplay feature permits players to set the number of spins and bet value automatically, providing a more comfortable experience for those who prefer a more hands-off approach.\n\nBetting Range\n\nThe betting range in Just Jewels ranges from 0.01€ to 9€, making it an ideal option with a low risk for cautious players and beginners, with a maximum bet of 9€. With every bet worth 0.01€, players can bet up to 100 credits on each payline, with an opportunity to activate up to nine paylines. \n\n        \n            ",

The gemstone theme is a classic in slot machines, and Just Jewels replicates this both visually, with actual integrated buttons, and with sound effects, to recreate the feeling of being in front of a land-based game. The dark blue background and various sparkling gemstones on the reels give you the sensation of having a treasure chest in front of you. \n\nThe gameplay is extremely simple, lacking any special features, but with a return of over 95% and decent wins, the game is still enjoyable and entertaining. The betting range is not particularly wide, with bets ranging from 0.01€ to 9€, making Just Jewels a perfect fit for cautious players and beginners who prefer not to risk too much before getting familiar with the game. \n\nSymbols and their value:\nThe symbols in Just Jewels represent wealth in all its forms, including gemstones, rolls of banknotes, the euro logo, gold bars, and dazzling tiaras set with precious stones. The value of the symbols, of course, varies. As for the gemstones, emeralds and amethysts are worth up to 15,000 tokens, while rubies and sapphires pay up to 20,000 tokens. The euro logo allows you to win up to 45,000 tokens, but a nice roll of banknotes can get you up to 50,000, as can a gold bar. \n\nThe ultimate prize, however, goes to the incredibly expensive crowns encrusted with precious gems. Representing the highest paying symbol in the game, these can win you the jackpot of 500,000 tokens!\n\nWild symbols are absent from Just Jewels, so there is no symbol that can substitute for others to complete a winning combination. The game does have Scatter symbols, however, which offer rewards even when they appear on the reels in non-adjacent positions, unlike the other symbols, which must always be aligned from left to right. \n\nBetting system:\nThe value of every bet in Just Jewels is expressed in terms of \"credits,\" each of which is worth 0.01€. You can bet up to 100 credits on each payline, for a total of 1€. This means that if you bet the maximum on all nine paylines, your total bet will only be 9€. \n\nYou can also choose how many paylines to activate, starting from 1, then 3, 5, 7, or 9. Don't let the low maximum bet value fool you into thinking that this is a slot not worth playing if you enjoy taking big risks. For more daring players, as is the tradition with Novomatic games, the Gamble feature allows you to double your winnings, regardless of the amount. \n\nFinally, there's the Autoplay feature, which allows you to set the number of spins and the value of your bet, and automatically spins the reels until the function is manually turned off. \n\nOverall, Just Jewels is a visually appealing and enjoyable game for all types of players, from beginners to experienced gamblers.\n        ",
