Wild Pumpkins is a Halloween-themed slot set in a spectral cemetery, amidst old tombstones, vials of poison, skulls, and bats. The predominant color is the dark blue of the night, with shades of purple from the fog that rises from the ground. There is no real grid, but the reels are separated from each other by skeletal branches. The graphics are beautiful, the icon designs are sharp, and every detail contributes to the gothic atmosphere that surrounds the game.\nThe sound department is made up of evocative music that fully blends with the aura of mystery that accompanies the gameplay.\n\nSome Information on Wild Pumpkins\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 4 rows, with 4096 ways to win, as indicated in the box in the bottom left corner. You win by matching identical symbols on adjacent reels, at least 3, starting from the left and progressing towards the right.\nAmong the features that must not be missing in a slot, there is Autoplay, which activates automatic spins starting from a minimum of 5 up to a maximum of 1,000. If you want, you can make them go indefinitely.\nAnother interesting feature is the Turbo button, which speeds up the rotation of the reels.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.5%, while the volatility is medium.\nFear Makes Ninety\nLet's now take a look at the symbols and various bonuses present in Wild Pumpkins. Accessing the paytable, we will notice that the symbols are divided into three groups based on their value: low level, mid-level, and high level. The first group includes the playing cards, the second includes sharp teeth, poison, and candy - eye. The biggest wins are ensured by the icons belonging to the third group, namely the skull, the carnivorous plant, and the bat. Jack O'Lantern is our Wild, and in addition to replacing all symbols except Scatter to complete winning combinations, he always appears with a x1, x2, or x3 multiplier. In case there are more Jack O'Lanterns to complete different combos, the amounts are multiplied and then added up.\nThe skeleton bat is our Scatter, and we need three of them to activate the Supernatural Spins feature. During the free spins, every Wild that lands on the reels remains sticky even in the following rounds. Each additional Scatter, moreover, rewards us with more Free Spins.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I play Wild Pumpkins on my smartphone?\nYes, because it is also available in HTML5 technology, which allows the slot to run on mobile devices.\n\nCan I try the slot before playing with real money?\nYes.

Wild Pumpkins is a Halloween-themed slot set in a spectral cemetery, amidst old tombstones, vials of poison, skulls, and bats. The predominant color is the dark blue of the night, with shades of purple from the fog that rises from the ground. There is no real grid, but the reels are separated from each other by skeletal branches. The graphics are beautiful, the icon designs are sharp, and every detail contributes to the gothic atmosphere that surrounds the game.\nThe sound department is made up of evocative music that fully blends with the aura of mystery that accompanies the gameplay.\n\nSome Information on Wild Pumpkins\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 4 rows, with 4096 ways to win, as indicated in the box in the bottom left corner. You win by matching identical symbols on adjacent reels, at least 3, starting from the left and progressing towards the right.\nAmong the features that must not be missing in a slot, there is Autoplay, which activates automatic spins starting from a minimum of 5 up to a maximum of 1,000. If you want, you can make them go indefinitely.\nAnother interesting feature is the Turbo button, which speeds up the rotation of the reels.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.5%, while the volatility is medium.\nFear Makes Ninety\nLet's now take a look at the symbols and various bonuses present in Wild Pumpkins. Accessing the paytable, we will notice that the symbols are divided into three groups based on their value: low level, mid-level, and high level. The first group includes the playing cards, the second includes sharp teeth, poison, and candy - eye. The biggest wins are ensured by the icons belonging to the third group, namely the skull, the carnivorous plant, and the bat. Jack O'Lantern is our Wild, and in addition to replacing all symbols except Scatter to complete winning combinations, he always appears with a x1, x2, or x3 multiplier. In case there are more Jack O'Lanterns to complete different combos, the amounts are multiplied and then added up.\nThe skeleton bat is our Scatter, and we need three of them to activate the Supernatural Spins feature. During the free spins, every Wild that lands on the reels remains sticky even in the following rounds. Each additional Scatter, moreover, rewards us with more Free Spins.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I play Wild Pumpkins on my smartphone?\nYes, because it is also available in HTML5 technology, which allows the slot to run on mobile devices.\n\nCan I try the slot before playing with real money?\nYes. On our website, the demo version allows us to test the game completely for free.\n\nAnd if I want to play with real money?\nJust take a look at the major online casinos that include Wild Pumpkins in their offer.\n        ",
