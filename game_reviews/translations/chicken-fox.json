            "response": "Looking for something that reminds you of country living? Then Chicken Fox might be the place for you, as this version from Lightning Box Games has a farm-inspired design and several great features that could make the action interesting.\n\nIf we analyze what is available in the game, there are 25 paylines involved, 5 reels will spin, while as far as payments go the slot seems capable of offering 13,500 times the bet per round. Multipliers, wilds and free spins may be the ones that add a bit of spice to the slot, giving you the features to trigger. \n\nThe action in Chicken Fox takes place in a cartoon barn. There you will find from A to 10 real values plus 4 different chicken symbols. These pay 6.66 times your bet if you land 5 in any mixed combination. In addition to these, there's a goat, a pig and a tractor that is the highest-paying standard symbol, offering prizes up to 13.33 times your bet per payline. \n\nThe farmer's wife is the wild. She is also the highest-paying symbol. Land 5 wilds in combination and you will receive a prize of 166.66 times your bet. The fox is a second wild. It doesn't offer any pay on its own, but it replaces all 4 chicken symbols.\n\nIt's a farm-inspired theme, which means you get images of characters who live and work there, but also of pets and birds. The chickens are an important part of this, with four versions designed for free spins. There's a fox chasing chickens, the farmer's wife paying a big prize, goats, pigs and tractors. Add the golden egg and you have the complete picture.\n\nChicken Fox is a simple slot machine. The cartoon images are fairly elementary but they do their job quite well. The basic action of the game is also quite well done. More potential is on offer in the Free Games feature. We found it quite difficult to land.\n\nChicken Fox is a cute online slot with a backyard theme. The game takes place in a chicken coop and there are all kinds of cute farm animals on the reels, including pigs, goats and chickens. Its graphics are rendered with adorable cartoon-style graphics that really capture your attention. \n\nFunctions and symbols of the slot machine\n\nYou can count on the Farmer's Wife to provide a lot of excitement to your gameplay, as in this case, the game will use her for the Wild feature. She is also the highest-paying symbol of the game, up to 5,000 coins coming from every complete combo formed with this symbol. \n\nA second wild feature is provided in the form of Fox. It's not as rewarding because it can't pay directly, but it can be used as a substitute for Chicken symbols. \n\nGolden Eggs will be the Scatter and these symbols must appear in the game, no matter where they do. You can have from 3 to 5 symbols of this type visible, and the game will deliver 8, 15 or 30 free spins, plus a prize up to 100 times the stake. \n\nThe free spins have their own separate reels, which have the Fox, eggs, and four types of chicken symbols, along with empty spaces. The four chicken symbols have a value each, and each time the Fox appears, it collects the money from the chickens visible on the reels at the time. Double Fox icons can also appear, paying twice the original win if they are visible. Further free spins can be triggered, if Eggs and Foxes are in view at the same time. All in all, it's possible to get up to 40 free spins and 2 multipliers for all spins, so there is a lot of potential in this feature. \n\nThe main offer, the Free Games feature, is activated by landing 3, 4 or 5 of the golden egg scatters. In addition to a payout of 2, 10 or 100 times your total bet, you will also receive 8, 15 or 30 free spins. These are played on a new set of reels that are composed of empty spaces, the 4 chicken symbols, an egg and the fox. \n\nEach of the chicken symbols has a cash value. If a fox lands, the fox collects all the cash values displayed by the chicken symbols and that's how much you win. \n\nThe wins range from 2.5 times your bet for the smallest chick to 33.33 times your bet if you see the fox and the adult rooster. Even better if you see a double fox, because this increases the win with a 2x multiplier. If you land a fox and an egg on the same free spin, you will win up to 5 extra free spins. \n\nIf the fox is a double one, you could get another 10 free spins. In practice, you can win up to 20 free spins with the fox and 40 free spins with a double fox (2x multiplier) on each free spin. \n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nAt first, we were not surprised by Chicken Fox and found it quite frustrating. Once we saw the potential rewards in the game, we liked it very quickly. We also recommend Jackaroo Jack by Lightning Box Games, because there's a huge stake in play, 768,000 times your bet to win!",

Possono apparire anche le icone Fox doppie, pagando il doppio della vincita originale se sono visibili. Ulteriori giri gratuiti possono essere attivati, se si hanno Uova e Volpi in vista contemporaneamente. Tutto sommato, è possibile ottenere un massimo di 40 giri gratis e 2 moltiplicatori per tutti i giri, quindi c’è molto potenziale in questa funzione.\nL’offerta principale, la funzione Free Games, si attiva con l’atterraggio di 3, 4 o 5 dello scatter dell’uovo d’oro. Oltre a un payout di 2, 10 o 100 volte la tua puntata totale, riceverai anche 8, 15 o 30 giri gratis. Questi si giocano su un nuovo set di bobine che sono composte da spazi vuoti, i 4 simboli della gallina, un uovo e la volpe.\nOgnuno dei simboli della gallina ha un valore in contanti. Se una volpe atterra, la volpe raccoglie tutti i valori in contanti esposti dai simboli della gallina e questo è quanto si vince.\nLe vincite vanno fino a 2,5 volte la tua puntata per il pulcino più piccolo fino a 33,33 volte la tua puntata se vedi la volpe e il gallo adulto. Meglio ancora se vedi una volpe doppia, perché questo aumenta la vincita con un moltiplicatore 2. Se atterrate una volpe e un uovo sullo stesso giro gratis, vincerete fino a 5 giri gratis extra.\nSe la volpe è un doppio, potreste ottenere altri 10 giri gratis. In pratica, si possono vincere fino a 20 giri gratis con la volpe e 40 giri gratis con una doppia volpe (moltiplicatore 2) su ogni giro gratis.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nAll’inizio non siamo stati sorpresi da Chicken Fox e l’abbiamo trovato piuttosto frustrante. Una volta che abbiamo visto le potenziali ricompense nel gioco, ci è piaciuto molto presto.

This version of Lightning Box Games has a farm-inspired design and several good features that could make the action interesting. The 25 paylines and 5 reels involved in the game offer the potential to win up to 13,500 times your bet per round, along with multipliers, wilds, and free spins that can add some spice to the slot and give you some exciting features to trigger.\n\nThe action in Chicken Fox takes place in a cartoonish barnyard. The game features a range of values from A to 10, as well as 4 different chicken symbols, paying out 6.66 times your bet when you land 5 in any mixed combination. In addition, there's a goat, a pig, and a tractor, which is the highest paying standard symbol, offering prizes up to 13.33 times your bet per payline. The farmer's wife is the wild and, as the highest paying symbol in the game, landing 5 of her in combination can earn you a prize of 166.66 times your bet. The fox is a second wild and, while not paying out on its own, it can replace all 4 chicken symbols.\n\nThe game's farm theme features characters living and working on the farm, as well as pets and birds. Chickens are an important part of this, with four versions designed for free spins. There's a fox chasing chickens, the farmer's wife, who pays out a big prize, goats, pigs, and tractors. Add the golden egg and you have the complete picture.\n\nChicken Fox is a simple online slot with a farmyard theme. The game takes place in a chicken coop and features all kinds of cute farm animals on the reels, including pigs, goats, and chickens. Its graphics are rendered in adorable cartoon style that really captures the attention of experienced gamblers.\n\nYou can count on the farmer's wife to provide lots of excitement to your gameplay, as in this case, the game uses her for the wild feature. She's also the highest paying symbol in the game, offering up to 5,000 coins from every complete combo formed with this symbol. A second wild feature is provided in the form of the fox. While not as rewarding, it can still be used as a substitute for the chicken symbols.\n\nGolden eggs are the scatter, and these symbols need to appear in the game, no matter where they do. Three to five of these symbols can be visible, and the game delivers 8, 15, or 30 free spins, plus a prize of up to 100 times your stake.\n\nThe free spins have their own separate reels, which feature the fox, eggs, and four types of chicken symbols, along with empty spaces. The four chicken symbols each have a value, and every time the fox appears, it collects the money from the visible chickens on the reels at the time. Double Fox icons can also appear, paying double the original win if visible. Additional free spins can be activated if eggs and foxes are visible at the same time. In total, you can get up to 40 free spins and 2 multipliers for all spins, so there's a lot of potential in this feature.\n\nThe main attraction, the Free Games feature, is triggered by landing 3, 4, or 5 golden egg scatters. In addition to a payout of 2, 10, or 100 times your total bet, you will also receive 8, 15, or 30 free spins. These are played on a new set of reels that are composed of empty spaces, the 4 chicken symbols, an egg, and the fox. Each of the chicken symbols has a cash value. If a fox lands, it collects all the cash values displayed by the chicken symbols, and that's how much you win. Winnings range from 2.5 times your bet for the smallest chick to 33.33 times your bet if you see the fox and the adult rooster. Even better if you see a double fox, because this increases the winnings with a 2x multiplier. If you land a fox and an egg on the same free spin, you can win up to 5 extra free spins.\n\nIf the fox is a double, you could win another 10 free spins. In practice, you can win up to 20 free spins with the fox and 40 free spins with a double fox (2x multiplier) on every free spin. At first, we weren't surprised by Chicken Fox and found it quite frustrating. But once we saw the potential rewards in the game, we liked it very much. We also recommend Jackaroo Jack from Lightning Box Games because there's a huge stake to be won, 768,000 times your bet!"

Then Chicken Fox might be the place for you, as this version from Lightning Box Games has a farm-inspired design and several great features that could make the action interesting.\n\nIf we analyze what is available in the game, there are 25 paylines involved, 5 reels will spin, while as far as payments go the slot seems capable of offering 13,500 times the bet per round. Multipliers, wilds and free spins may be the ones that add a bit of spice to the slot, giving you the features to trigger. \n\nThe action in Chicken Fox takes place in a cartoon barn. There you will find from A to 10 real values plus 4 different chicken symbols. These pay 6.66 times your bet if you land 5 in any mixed combination. In addition to these, there's a goat, a pig and a tractor that is the highest-paying standard symbol, offering prizes up to 13.33 times your bet per payline. \n\nThe farmer's wife is the wild. She is also the highest-paying symbol. Land 5 wilds in combination and you will receive a prize of 166.66 times your bet. The fox is a second wild. It doesn't offer any pay on its own, but it replaces all 4 chicken symbols.\n\nIt's a farm-inspired theme, which means you get images of characters who live and work there, but also of pets and birds. The chickens are an important part of this, with four versions designed for free spins. There's a fox chasing chickens, the farmer's wife paying a big prize, goats, pigs and tractors. Add the golden egg and you have the complete picture.\n\nChicken Fox is a simple slot machine. The cartoon images are fairly elementary but they do their job quite well. The basic action of the game is also quite well done. More potential is on offer in the Free Games feature. We found it quite difficult to land.\n\nChicken Fox is a cute online slot with a backyard theme. The game takes place in a chicken coop and there are all kinds of cute farm animals on the reels, including pigs, goats and chickens. Its graphics are rendered with adorable cartoon-style graphics that really capture your attention. \n\nFunctions and symbols of the slot machine\n\nYou can count on the Farmer's Wife to provide a lot of excitement to your gameplay, as in this case, the game will use her for the Wild feature. She is also the highest-paying symbol of the game, up to 5,000 coins coming from every complete combo formed with this symbol. \n\nA second wild feature is provided in the form of Fox. It's not as rewarding because it can't pay directly, but it can be used as a substitute for Chicken symbols. \n\nGolden Eggs will be the Scatter and these symbols must appear in the game, no matter where they do. You can have from 3 to 5 symbols of this type visible, and the game will deliver 8, 15 or 30 free spins, plus a prize up to 100 times the stake. \n\nThe free spins have their own separate reels, which have the Fox, eggs, and four types of chicken symbols, along with empty spaces. The four chicken symbols have a value each, and each time the Fox appears, it collects the money from the chickens visible on the reels at the time. Double Fox icons can also appear, paying twice the original win if they are visible. Further free spins can be triggered, if Eggs and Foxes are in view at the same time. All in all, it's possible to get up to 40 free spins and 2 multipliers for all spins, so there is a lot of potential in this feature. \n\nThe main offer, the Free Games feature, is activated by landing 3, 4 or 5 of the golden egg scatters. In addition to a payout of 2, 10 or 100 times your total bet, you will also receive 8, 15 or 30 free spins. These are played on a new set of reels that are composed of empty spaces, the 4 chicken symbols, an egg and the fox. \n\nEach of the chicken symbols has a cash value. If a fox lands, the fox collects all the cash values displayed by the chicken symbols and that's how much you win. \n\nThe wins range from 2.5 times your bet for the smallest chick to 33.33 times your bet if you see the fox and the adult rooster. Even better if you see a double fox, because this increases the win with a 2x multiplier. If you land a fox and an egg on the same free spin, you will win up to 5 extra free spins. \n\nIf the fox is a double one, you could get another 10 free spins. In practice, you can win up to 20 free spins with the fox and 40 free spins with a double fox (2x multiplier) on each free spin. \n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nAt first, we were not surprised by Chicken Fox and found it quite frustrating. Once we saw the potential rewards in the game, we liked it very quickly. We also recommend Jackaroo Jack by Lightning Box Games, because there's a huge stake in play, 768,000 times your bet to win!\n            ",

But be warned, some of these chickens are no spring chickens, so make sure the fox is quick and nimble! If the fox is a double one, players could get another 10 free spins. This is where things get egg-ceptional because in practice, players can win up to 20 free spins with the fox and 40 free spins with a double fox (2x multiplier) on each free spin. </p><p>In conclusion, Chicken Fox is one of the most egg-citing and entertaining slot games out there. From the excellent Free Games feature to the cash value of each of the chicken symbols, and the potential to win big with a double fox, this game will make you squawk with delight!

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame design and graphics\n\nChicken Fox is a farm-inspired slot machine with cartoon-style graphics that perfectly capture the countryside feel of the game. The design features images of farm characters including chickens, pigs, and goats, that live and work on the farm. The action takes place in a chicken coop and the reels are filled with adorable cartoon-style graphics that can grab your attention right from the start. \n\nSymbols and their values\n\nThe slot follows a traditional gameplay system with 5 reels and 25 paylines available for players. In terms of standard symbols, the game includes values from A to 10 accompanied by different farm animals such as pigs, goats, and chickens. The chicken symbols are the most important ones and come in four different versions designed for free spins. The Fox is a second wild that cannot pay directly, but it can replace all four chicken symbols. In addition, the farmer's wife is a wild that can pay up to 5,000 coins for every complete combo formed with this symbol. \n\nPaylines and potential winnings\n\nChicken Fox has a payout potential of up to 13,500 times the bet per round, with players having the chance to make the most out of the 25 paylines available in the game. The chances of winning big are pretty high, but the game's medium variance may slow things down a bit. Nonetheless, with a combination of multipliers, wilds, and free spins, the game is capable of offering a solid return. \n\nBonus features (multipliers, wilds, free spins)\n\nThere are several great bonus features in the game that make the action more engaging, including multipliers, wilds, and free spins. The Farmer's Wife is a wild feature that provides excitement to gameplay. She is also the highest paying symbol of the game. A second wild feature is offered in the form of Fox, which can't pay directly but can be used as a substitute for Chicken symbols. Golden Eggs are the Scatters and can trigger the Free Games feature. \n\nScatter symbols and Free Games feature\n\nGolden Eggs are the Scatter symbols in Chicken Fox and players must have three, four or five of them on the reels to trigger the Free Games feature.

The game features multipliers, wilds, and free spins, which add an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay. The game is set in a cartoon barn and features several farm-inspired symbols including chickens, pigs, goats, and tractors.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nThe game offers players the chance to win up to 13,500 times their bet per round. The highest-paying symbol of the game is the Farmer’s Wife, which can award up to 5,000 coins for every complete combo formed with this symbol. There is also a second Wild feature in the form of Fox, which is less rewarding and cannot pay directly, but can be used as a substitute for Chicken symbols. The Scatter symbol is the Golden Egg, and landing three to five of them can trigger 8, 15, or 30 free spins, as well as a prize up to 100 times the stake.\n\nGame Features\n\nChicken Fox features multipliers, wilds, and free spins that add an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay. The game has an excellent Free Games feature that is triggered by landing 3, 4 or 5 of the golden egg scatters. Players can receive up to 30 free spins during this feature. Each of the chicken symbols has a cash value, and if a fox lands, the fox collects all the cash values displayed by the chicken symbols, and that's how much players win. If the fox is a double one, players could get another 10 free spins. In practice, they can win up to 20 free spins with the fox and 40 free spins with a double fox (2x multiplier) on each free spin. \n\nSymbol Descriptions\n\nThe farm-inspired symbols in the game include A to 10 real values, four different chicken symbols, a goat, a pig, and a tractor. The chicken symbols pay 6.66 times your bet if you land 5 in any mixed combination. The highest paying symbol of the game is the Farmer's Wife who also serves as the Wild symbol. The other Wild feature is Fox, which replaces all four chicken symbols but does not offer any pay on its own. The Scatter symbol is the Golden Egg that can appear anywhere on the reels and triggers free spins.\n\nScatter Symbol\n\nThe Scatter symbol in the game is the Golden Egg that can appear anywhere on the reels and triggers free spins when three or more symbols appear on the reels. The Scatter symbol also awards players with a payout of 2, 10, or 100 times their total bet.\n\nFree Games Feature\n\nThe Free Games feature is triggered by landing 3, 4, or 5 Golden Egg symbols. Players can win up to 30 free spins and cash values on these spins. During free spins, there's a Fox chasing the chicken symbols. If a Fox lands, it collects all the cash values displayed by the chicken symbols. A double Fox can also appear, paying twice the original win if they are visible. If you land a fox and an egg in the same free spin, you will win up to 5 extra free spins. Players can win up to 40 free spins if they get lucky.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nChicken Fox is presented in a cartoon-style graphics design that captures the attention of players. The game is set in a farmyard environment that features several farm animals, including chickens, pigs, goats, and tractors. The colors used in the game complement the design and give the game an overall bright and fun appearance.\n\n        \n            ",

Then Chicken Fox might be the place for you, as this version from Lightning Box Games has a farm-inspired design and several great features that could make the action interesting.\n\nIf we analyze what is available in the game, there are 25 paylines involved, 5 reels will spin, while as far as payments go the slot seems capable of offering 13,500 times the bet per round. Multipliers, wilds and free spins may be the ones that add a bit of spice to the slot, giving you the features to trigger. \n\nThe action in Chicken Fox takes place in a cartoon barn. There you will find from A to 10 real values plus 4 different chicken symbols. These pay 6.66 times your bet if you land 5 in any mixed combination. In addition to these, there's a goat, a pig and a tractor that is the highest-paying standard symbol, offering prizes up to 13.33 times your bet per payline. \n\nThe farmer's wife is the wild. She is also the highest-paying symbol. Land 5 wilds in combination and you will receive a prize of 166.66 times your bet. The fox is a second wild. It doesn't offer any pay on its own, but it replaces all 4 chicken symbols.\n\nIt's a farm-inspired theme, which means you get images of characters who live and work there, but also of pets and birds. The chickens are an important part of this, with four versions designed for free spins. There's a fox chasing chickens, the farmer's wife paying a big prize, goats, pigs and tractors. Add the golden egg and you have the complete picture.\n\nChicken Fox is a simple slot machine. The cartoon images are fairly elementary but they do their job quite well. The basic action of the game is also quite well done. More potential is on offer in the Free Games feature. We found it quite difficult to land.\n\nChicken Fox is a cute online slot with a backyard theme. The game takes place in a chicken coop and there are all kinds of cute farm animals on the reels, including pigs, goats and chickens. Its graphics are rendered with adorable cartoon-style graphics that really capture your attention. \n\nFunctions and symbols of the slot machine\n\nYou can count on the Farmer's Wife to provide a lot of excitement to your gameplay, as in this case, the game will use her for the Wild feature. She is also the highest-paying symbol of the game, up to 5,000 coins coming from every complete combo formed with this symbol. \n\nA second wild feature is provided in the form of Fox. It's not as rewarding because it can't pay directly, but it can be used as a substitute for Chicken symbols. \n\nGolden Eggs will be the Scatter and these symbols must appear in the game, no matter where they do. You can have from 3 to 5 symbols of this type visible, and the game will deliver 8, 15 or 30 free spins, plus a prize up to 100 times the stake. \n\nThe free spins have their own separate reels, which have the Fox, eggs, and four types of chicken symbols, along with empty spaces. The four chicken symbols have a value each, and each time the Fox appears, it collects the money from the chickens visible on the reels at the time. Double Fox icons can also appear, paying twice the original win if they are visible. Further free spins can be triggered, if Eggs and Foxes are in view at the same time. All in all, it's possible to get up to 40 free spins and 2 multipliers for all spins, so there is a lot of potential in this feature. \n\nThe main offer, the Free Games feature, is activated by landing 3, 4 or 5 of the golden egg scatters. In addition to a payout of 2, 10 or 100 times your total bet, you will also receive 8, 15 or 30 free spins. These are played on a new set of reels that are composed of empty spaces, the 4 chicken symbols, an egg and the fox. \n\nEach of the chicken symbols has a cash value. If a fox lands, the fox collects all the cash values displayed by the chicken symbols and that's how much you win. \n\nThe wins range from 2.5 times your bet for the smallest chick to 33.33 times your bet if you see the fox and the adult rooster. Even better if you see a double fox, because this increases the win with a 2x multiplier. If you land a fox and an egg on the same free spin, you will win up to 5 extra free spins. \n\nIf the fox is a double one, you could get another 10 free spins. In practice, you can win up to 20 free spins with the fox and 40 free spins with a double fox (2x multiplier) on each free spin. \n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nAt first, we were not surprised by Chicken Fox and found it quite frustrating. Once we saw the potential rewards in the game, we liked it very quickly. We also recommend Jackaroo Jack by Lightning Box Games, because there's a huge stake in play, 768,000 times your bet to win!\n            ",

Then Chicken Fox might be the place for you, as this version from Lightning Box Games has a farm-inspired design and several great features that could make the action interesting.\n\nIf we analyze what is available in the game, there are 25 paylines involved, 5 reels will spin, while as far as payments go the slot seems capable of offering 13,500 times the bet per round. Multipliers, wilds and free spins may be the ones that add a bit of spice to the slot, giving you the features to trigger. \n\nThe action in Chicken Fox takes place in a cartoon barn. There you will find from A to 10 real values plus 4 different chicken symbols. These pay 6.66 times your bet if you land 5 in any mixed combination. In addition to these, there's a goat, a pig and a tractor that is the highest-paying standard symbol, offering prizes up to 13.33 times your bet per payline. \n\nThe farmer's wife is the wild. She is also the highest-paying symbol. Land 5 wilds in combination and you will receive a prize of 166.66 times your bet. The fox is a second wild. It doesn't offer any pay on its own, but it replaces all 4 chicken symbols.\n\nIt's a farm-inspired theme, which means you get images of characters who live and work there, but also of pets and birds. The chickens are an important part of this, with four versions designed for free spins. There's a fox chasing chickens, the farmer's wife paying a big prize, goats, pigs and tractors. Add the golden egg and you have the complete picture.\n\nChicken Fox is a simple slot machine. The cartoon images are fairly elementary but they do their job quite well. The basic action of the game is also quite well done. More potential is on offer in the Free Games feature. We found it quite difficult to land.\n\nChicken Fox is a cute online slot with a backyard theme. The game takes place in a chicken coop and there are all kinds of cute farm animals on the reels, including pigs, goats and chickens. Its graphics are rendered with adorable cartoon-style graphics that really capture your attention. \n\nFunctions and symbols of the slot machine\n\nYou can count on the Farmer's Wife to provide a lot of excitement to your gameplay, as in this case, the game will use her for the Wild feature. She is also the highest-paying symbol of the game, up to 5,000 coins coming from every complete combo formed with this symbol. \n\nA second wild feature is provided in the form of Fox. It's not as rewarding because it can't pay directly, but it can be used as a substitute for Chicken symbols. \n\nGolden Eggs will be the Scatter and these symbols must appear in the game, no matter where they do. You can have from 3 to 5 symbols of this type visible, and the game will deliver 8, 15 or 30 free spins, plus a prize up to 100 times the stake. \n\nThe free spins have their own separate reels, which have the Fox, eggs, and four types of chicken symbols, along with empty spaces. The four chicken symbols have a value each, and each time the Fox appears, it collects the money from the chickens visible on the reels at the time. Double Fox icons can also appear, paying twice the original win if they are visible. Further free spins can be triggered, if Eggs and Foxes are in view at the same time. All in all, it's possible to get up to 40 free spins and 2 multipliers for all spins, so there is a lot of potential in this feature. \n\nThe main offer, the Free Games feature, is activated by landing 3, 4 or 5 of the golden egg scatters. In addition to a payout of 2, 10 or 100 times your total bet, you will also receive 8, 15 or 30 free spins. These are played on a new set of reels that are composed of empty spaces, the 4 chicken symbols, an egg and the fox. \n\nEach of the chicken symbols has a cash value. If a fox lands, the fox collects all the cash values displayed by the chicken symbols and that's how much you win. \n\nThe wins range from 2.5 times your bet for the smallest chick to 33.33 times your bet if you see the fox and the adult rooster. Even better if you see a double fox, because this increases the win with a 2x multiplier. If you land a fox and an egg on the same free spin, you will win up to 5 extra free spins. \n\nIf the fox is a double one, you could get another 10 free spins. In practice, you can win up to 20 free spins with the fox and 40 free spins with a double fox (2x multiplier) on each free spin. \n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nAt first, we were not surprised by Chicken Fox and found it quite frustrating. Once we saw the potential rewards in the game, we liked it very quickly. We also recommend Jackaroo Jack by Lightning Box Games, because there's a huge stake in play, 768,000 times your bet to win!\n            ",
