In fact, it is one of the most common themes found in modern games, just like fruits and diamonds were in the past.\n\nWe have seen Ancient Egypt-themed slot machines in every variation imaginable, from those set in pyramids to those on the banks of the Nile, from those with palm trees and deserts to those developed in tombs and temples. There is truly something for everyone, and maybe even more than enough!\n\nWilliams Interactive, which already has slot machines of this type in its catalog, doesn't bring anything new to the table when it comes to the theme, but in terms of graphics, we find that Desert Cats offers elements that make it unique in some way.\n\nAt first glance, before focusing on the images, it looks like a classic arcade machine with bright colors and precious stones. But in fact, if you look closer, you'll see that the absolute stars of the slot are the cats, sacred animals in Egyptian culture, with sparkling and colorful eyes.\n\nDon't expect special effects or 3D animations when playing Desert Cats, but enjoy a sleek and well-designed graphics panel that is perfectly consistent with the easy and intuitive gameplay!\n\nMain features of the slot\n\nThe structure of Desert Cats is not the traditional five-reel one. There are seven reels, with four rows and a whopping fifty paylines.\n\nThe minimum bet is set at 50 cents (1 cent per each of the fixed paylines), while the maximum is €100, a figure that will certainly satisfy high rollers.\n\nThe highest win you can aspire to while playing Desert Cats is €250,000, which is definitely more than satisfactory, although it is not so easy to hit!\n\nThe theoretical return to the player (return to player or RTP) of 95.79% is slightly below average, in line with other products from the WMS software house that rarely exceed 96%.\n\nSymbols and features of Desert Cats\n\nWith so many reels, the chances of winning on Desert Cats are not remote, however, in virtue of the low volatility that characterizes this slot, the prizes are frequent but of low value.\n\nThe base symbols that pay the least are the numbers and letters that refer to playing cards from 10 to Ace, and an alignment of at least three symbols is required to obtain a win.\n\nThematic symbols include a stone stele, a cross of life, the head of a pharaoh, and the statue of a cat.\n\nThe Jackpot symbol is the goddess of war Bastet, which pays 200 times the value of the bet when it appears on all seven reels.\n\nTwo Wild symbols are present, both represented by golden cats, one regular and one special that occupies four positions on the game grid.\n            ",

The stars of the slot are the cats, sacred animals in Egyptian culture, with sparkling and colorful eyes.\n\nSeven reels and 50 paylines\n\nDesert Cats has an unconventional structure of seven reels with four rows and a total of fifty fixed paylines. This offers more chances to win. The prizes are frequent, but of low value, which characterizes the low volatility of the slot.\n\nMinimum and maximum bets\n\nThe minimum bet is 50 cents, while the maximum bet is €100, which is suitable for high rollers. The highest win possible is €250,000, although it is challenging to hit.\n\nWild symbols and jackpot\n\nThe game offers two Wild symbols represented by golden cats. One is a regular Wild symbol, while the other one is a special symbol that occupies four positions on the game grid. The Jackpot symbol is the goddess of war Bastet, which pays out 200 times the value of the bet when it appears on all seven reels.\n\n        \n            ",

The graphics are designed to make the game unique in some way, with vibrant and sparking cat animations, although there are no special effects or 3D animations.\n\nA Seven-Reel Slot with 50 Paylines\n\nUnlike traditional five-reel machines, Desert Cats has seven reels and 50 fixed paylines. For this reason, players have a good chance of winning, despite the low volatility of the slot. The game is easy to play, and the graphics are sleek and well-designed.\n\nBetting Options and Maximum Win You Can Expect\n\nWith a minimum bet limit of 50 cents and a maximum of €100, the game is ideal for both casual players and high rollers. The highest win you can hope to get on Desert Cats is €250,000, but it is not so easy to achieve. The theoretical return to players (RTP) percentage is slightly below average at 95.79%.\n\nDiverse Symbols and Wilds\n\nDesert Cats has both low and high payout symbols. Base symbols include numbers and letters that refer to playing cards between 10 and Ace, while thematic symbols include the cross of life, a stone stele, the head of a pharaoh, and the statue of a cat. The goddess of war Bastet represents the jackpot symbol, which pays 200 times the value of the bet when it appears on all seven reels. Two wild symbols are present, a standard golden cat and a unique variation that occupies four positions on the game grid.\n\n        \n            ",

There is truly something for everyone, and maybe even more than enough!\n\nWilliams Interactive, which already has slot machines of this type in its catalog, doesn't bring anything new to the table when it comes to the theme, but in terms of graphics, we find that Desert Cats offers elements that make it unique in some way.\n\nAt first glance, before focusing on the images, it looks like a classic arcade machine with bright colors and precious stones. But in fact, if you look closer, you'll see that the absolute stars of the slot are the cats, sacred animals in Egyptian culture, with sparkling and colorful eyes.\n\nDon't expect special effects or 3D animations when playing Desert Cats, but enjoy a sleek and well-designed graphics panel that is perfectly consistent with the easy and intuitive gameplay!\n\nMain features of the slot\n\nThe structure of Desert Cats is not the traditional five-reel one.

The warrior should be depicted with a big grin on their face, wearing a colorful outfit and holding a scepter in one hand. They should also be wearing glasses, which should be prominently featured.\n\nIn the background, there should be a desert landscape with palm trees and pyramids in the distance. The golden cats from the game should be incorporated into the image, lounging around the warrior's feet or perched on the scepter. The overall vibe of the image should be fun and playful, capturing the excitement of playing Desert Cats."
