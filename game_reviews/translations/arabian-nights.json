Set in the mystical world of Arabian folklore, the game takes inspiration from the story of Aladdin and the genie in the magic lamp. While the graphics are not very elaborate, the game's themed symbols create an overall pleasant effect. The real attraction of Arabian Nights is the amazing jackpot of €3,000,000. The game features traditional Arabian symbols, such as Aladdin, the magic lamp, a camel, and a desert tent. The Wild symbol is Aladdin himself, and the Scatter is represented by the magic lamp.

The theme of Arabian folklore is well portrayed through the use of themed symbols and features. Although the graphics are not very elaborate, they create an overall pleasant effect. The inclusion of the Wild and Scatter symbols and the 15 free spins with 3x multiplier feature add to the excitement of the game. We highly recommend Arabian Nights to anyone looking for a fun and potentially lucrative slot game experience.\"\n  }\n]"

Arabian Nights, from NetEnt, is a perfect example of the genre.\nThe game is set in the mystical world of the Arabian nights, taking inspiration, in particular, from the story of Aladdin and the genie in the magic lamp.\nContrary to NetEnt's usual style, the game's graphics are not very elaborate: the screen layout is standard, with buttons to set up the game at the bottom. The reels are encased in a simple golden frame on a static background.\nThe themed symbols appear to come straight out of \"The Thousand and One Nights\" and, although not particularly realistic, they create an overall pleasant effect.\nWhat attracts players most to Arabian Nights, however, is the amazing jackpot: €3,000,000 makes up for any lack of graphics!\nSymbols, Wilds and Scatters:\nDesigned on simple monochromatic backgrounds, the symbols that alternate on the reels in Arabian Nights are inspired by traditional Arabian folklore. Among them, we see the smiling Aladdin wearing a red waistcoat and a turban, the golden magic lamp, an indispensable camel, the typical Arab hat, green shoes with a curled tip and a desert tent.\nThe game also features the numbers and letters that correspond to poker cards from 9 to Ace, following the best traditions of land-based slot machines.\nThe Wild symbol is Aladdin himself, with his mustache upturned and a diamond in his hand. It can replace all other symbols (except for the Scatter) to create a winning combination, with a prize multiplied by three times the bet. In addition, if it appears on at least two paylines, it pays out by itself. The most sought-after combination is undoubtedly the one made up of 5 Wild symbols, which triggers the whopping €3,000,000 jackpot!\nThe Scatter is represented by the magic lamp and appears in any position on the reels. If it appears at least three times, it triggers 15 free spins, during which all winning combinations have a 3x multiplier. Under the same conditions, further multipliers and free spins can be obtained.\nThe Scatter has more than one function: if it appears twice on a payline, it pays out twice the bet; three Scatters multiply the bet by 5x, four by 20x, and if the lamp occupies all five reels, the payout is a massive 500 times the bet!\nSimilar Slots to Arabian Nights:\nThe theme of Arabian folklore has been extensively developed in slot machines. Among the various titles, we recall Arabian Oasis, Aladdin’s Treasure, and Arabian Rose. Additionally, we recommend Abra Kebab Ra, which revolves around Arabian cuisine.\n        ",
