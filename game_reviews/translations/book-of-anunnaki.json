This unique slot game from Felix Gaming includes standard features, free spins, and an expanding wild. With an RTP of 95.87% and 10 paylines, let's take a closer look at the game.\n\nGraphics: The slot has a classic Egyptian aesthetic, with a deliberately simplistic gameplay on a standard 5x3 layout. The symbols include the magical book as the wild, which substitutes for all other symbols and pays up to 1,000 times your bet for five on the reels. The statue pays 500 times the bet, while the Anubis eye brings up to 200 times the bet for five icons in play.\n\nSpecial Features: The game's interesting bonus features include free spins, triggered by placing at least 3 scatter symbols in the game. You'll receive 15 free spins, and during the round, you can select a special symbol that will expand until the end of the extra spins. If you manage to find 3 more scatters during this round, you can reactivate 15 more spins and change the special symbol. There is no limit to the number of spins received!\n\nFinal Thoughts: We were transported by the Book of Anunnaki and found that, while it has excellent graphics and gameplay, it remains a bit bland. This isn't a disadvantage, but it will appeal to only a specific category of players. The provider has rated the game's volatility at 4 out of 5, so dream payouts are rare - the maximum you can obtain is through activating the free spins.",

This unique slot game from Felix Gaming includes standard features, free spins, and an expanding wild.

The symbols include the magical book as the wild, which substitutes for all other symbols and pays up to 1,000 times your bet for five on the reels. The statue pays 500 times the bet, while the Anubis eye brings up to 200 times the bet for five icons in play.\n\nSpecial Features: The game's interesting bonus features include free spins, triggered by placing at least 3 scatter symbols in the game.

The provider has rated the game's volatility at 4 out of 5, so dream payouts are rare - the maximum you can obtain is through activating the free spins.\n            ",
