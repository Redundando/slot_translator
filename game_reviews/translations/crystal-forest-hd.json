This slot, produced by the software house WMS, takes us straight into the house of fairies, in a magical world reproduced with accuracy and attention to detail.\nIn Crystal Forest, we can find every type of plant, flower and fairy, all immersed in a magical forest with a nighttime background. The graphic compartment is really beautiful; those who designed it used blue as a background against which the symbols and images stand out, resulting in an enchanted experience.\nImmersed in a magical world, in the company of fairies, unicorns, butterflies, ladybugs and many other creatures, you will experience a visually satisfying and engaging game. But be careful when moving through the enchanted landscape of Crystal Forest; if you step on a magical creature, you could be struck by a spell and lose your winnings!\nYou can also play Crystal Forest in Play for Fun mode to discover all the tricks of the slot and practice before betting real money!\n\nKey features of the slot:\nCrystal Forest is a slot that features a very traditional basic structure: it has five reels, three rows, and 25 paylines.

Since the paylines are fixed, the total range of bets is from a minimum of €0.25 to a maximum of €125.\nThe highest win you can get playing Crystal Forest is 3,750 coins, which can be achieved thanks to different features of the slot, such as free spins, symbols that \"rain\" on the cascading reels, and stacked wilds.\nCrystal Forest presents an intuitive interface that is very easy to use and offers decent loading speed even when a fast internet connection is not available.

It does not have a traditional function as a wild but rather serves as a scatter, offering between 7 and 50 free spins. There is a second symbol, the gnome, which serves as a wild and can replace all other symbols to complete a winning combination.\nThere is no scatter symbol, but there is a Jackpot symbol, which pays the highest win when it appears on all five reels.\nCrystal Forest offers a cascading reels system. After each win, the symbols that formed the winning combination are cleared from the reels and replaced by new ones cascading down. This feature continues until new winning combinations are no longer formed.\n            ",

But don't let the classic structure fool you, this game packs a punch with its various features!</p>\n\n    <p>Firstly, the coin value ranges from 1 cent to 5 euros, giving players a broad range of betting options. However, it's not just the coin value that players can customize, they can also activate the Autoplay feature for those who want to sit back and let the magic happen on its own.</p>\n\n    <p>One of the exciting features of the game is the cascading reels. Once a winning combination is achieved, those symbols explode and disappear, allowing new symbols to cascade from the top into the game space. This provides more chances to create even more winning combinations with just a single spin!</p>\n\n    <p>Crystal Forest HD also has stacked wilds which can appear on any reel. With the potential to turn the whole reel wild, players have the chance to land some truly magical wins.

This slot, produced by the software house WMS, takes us straight into the house of fairies, in a magical world reproduced with accuracy and attention to detail.\nIn Crystal Forest, we can find every type of plant, flower and fairy, all immersed in a magical forest with a nighttime background. The graphic compartment is really beautiful; those who designed it used blue as a background against which the symbols and images stand out, resulting in an enchanted experience.\nImmersed in a magical world, in the company of fairies, unicorns, butterflies, ladybugs and many other creatures, you will experience a visually satisfying and engaging game. But be careful when moving through the enchanted landscape of Crystal Forest; if you step on a magical creature, you could be struck by a spell and lose your winnings!\nYou can also play Crystal Forest in Play for Fun mode to discover all the tricks of the slot and practice before betting real money!\n\nKey features of the slot:\nCrystal Forest is a slot that features a very traditional basic structure: it has five reels, three rows, and 25 paylines. The value of the coins in this game ranges between 1 cent and 5 €. Since the paylines are fixed, the total range of bets is from a minimum of €0.25 to a maximum of €125.\nThe highest win you can get playing Crystal Forest is 3,750 coins, which can be achieved thanks to different features of the slot, such as free spins, symbols that \"rain\" on the cascading reels, and stacked wilds.\nCrystal Forest presents an intuitive interface that is very easy to use and offers decent loading speed even when a fast internet connection is not available. It can be played not only on desktop computers but also on mobile devices on both Android and iOS.\n\nSymbols and special features of Crystal Forest:\nThe symbols of this beautiful WMS slot machine are entirely thematic and linked to the magical world of fairy tales: fairies, unicorns, ladybugs, mushrooms, rabbits, magic wands, lanterns, and garlands alternate on the reels of Crystal Forest.\nThe Wild symbol is represented by a waterfall and appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. It does not have a traditional function as a wild but rather serves as a scatter, offering between 7 and 50 free spins. There is a second symbol, the gnome, which serves as a wild and can replace all other symbols to complete a winning combination.\nThere is no scatter symbol, but there is a Jackpot symbol, which pays the highest win when it appears on all five reels.\nCrystal Forest offers a cascading reels system. After each win, the symbols that formed the winning combination are cleared from the reels and replaced by new ones cascading down. This feature continues until new winning combinations are no longer formed.\n            ",

This slot, produced by the software house WMS, takes us straight into the house of fairies, in a magical world reproduced with accuracy and attention to detail.\nIn Crystal Forest, we can find every type of plant, flower and fairy, all immersed in a magical forest with a nighttime background. The graphic compartment is really beautiful; those who designed it used blue as a background against which the symbols and images stand out, resulting in an enchanted experience.\nImmersed in a magical world, in the company of fairies, unicorns, butterflies, ladybugs and many other creatures, you will experience a visually satisfying and engaging game. But be careful when moving through the enchanted landscape of Crystal Forest; if you step on a magical creature, you could be struck by a spell and lose your winnings!\nYou can also play Crystal Forest in Play for Fun mode to discover all the tricks of the slot and practice before betting real money!\n\nKey features of the slot:\nCrystal Forest is a slot that features a very traditional basic structure: it has five reels, three rows, and 25 paylines. The value of the coins in this game ranges between 1 cent and 5 €. Since the paylines are fixed, the total range of bets is from a minimum of €0.25 to a maximum of €125.\nThe highest win you can get playing Crystal Forest is 3,750 coins, which can be achieved thanks to different features of the slot, such as free spins, symbols that \"rain\" on the cascading reels, and stacked wilds.\nCrystal Forest presents an intuitive interface that is very easy to use and offers decent loading speed even when a fast internet connection is not available. It can be played not only on desktop computers but also on mobile devices on both Android and iOS.\n\nSymbols and special features of Crystal Forest:\nThe symbols of this beautiful WMS slot machine are entirely thematic and linked to the magical world of fairy tales: fairies, unicorns, ladybugs, mushrooms, rabbits, magic wands, lanterns, and garlands alternate on the reels of Crystal Forest.\nThe Wild symbol is represented by a waterfall and appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. It does not have a traditional function as a wild but rather serves as a scatter, offering between 7 and 50 free spins. There is a second symbol, the gnome, which serves as a wild and can replace all other symbols to complete a winning combination.\nThere is no scatter symbol, but there is a Jackpot symbol, which pays the highest win when it appears on all five reels.\nCrystal Forest offers a cascading reels system. After each win, the symbols that formed the winning combination are cleared from the reels and replaced by new ones cascading down. This feature continues until new winning combinations are no longer formed.\n        ",
