Join the Mad Hatter for a Jackpot tea party and a truly enriching experience. Set amidst the flora and fauna of Wonderland, this fairytale-themed slot game is colourful and full of energy. \n\nWith gardens full of mushrooms in the background (as well as playing cards), you'll see card suits as low-value symbols. You'll also see pocket watches, teacups, butterflies, the hare, and the cheshire cat - the latter three appear on top of the cakes. \n\nThere's also the Mad Hatter who pays 0.75, 2.5, or 10 times your bet for 3, 4, or 5 in combination. The hat on a gold coin is the wild symbol that replaces all the above-mentioned symbols. Graphically, Absolootly Mad: Mega Moolah is the first Slot Machine with HD designs and an enchanting soundtrack that makes you feel as though you are in Wonderland. \n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nLet's say that rolling wins are one of the game's extra features. This feature not only occurs in the base game but is also available in the free spin bonus, which triggers an increase in multipliers. \n\nWhen a win is triggered during Free Spins, the next win gets a 3x, the one after 6x, the third win gets 9x, and the fourth and all subsequent wins get a 15x multiplier. \n\nAs for the Free Spins bonus, it's activated by the wooden door, which is the game's scatter symbol. You start with eight spins, but the bonus can be retriggered with three or more doors if they stop further on the reels. \n\nAbsolootly Mad: Mega Moolah is a 5-reel, 3 progressive jackpot row slot with 243 ways to win. Playable from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin, wins are formed by landing 3 or more matching symbols on adjacent reels, regardless of position, starting from the first reel. \n\nHigh variance, the RTP is 92.02%, which is low, but it's a progressive jackpot game - the normal range for a jackpot game is around 94-95%. In terms of hit frequency, it's 32.57%, which means that almost 1 in 3 spins will result in a winning combination. The maximum win is 2,343x your total bet from a free spin - you can win 7 or even 8 figures from the progressive jackpots. \n\nYou can play Absolootly Mad: Mega Moolah on desktop, mobile, or tablet devices - as long as your devices are powered by iOS, Android, or Windows. The 5x3 reel layout works well even on smartphone screens, which helps. You can use the Autoplay feature for as long as you like, but up to 100 spins available.

The wins are marked by fanfare, and big wins are rewarded with more golden coins than one could count. \n\nThroughout your adventure with the game, you'll be treated to a musical theme that comes from Alice's universe but fits perfectly with the gameplay. \n\nAbsolootly Mad: Mega Moolah is inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as you head to a land full of crazy wins. Join the Mad Hatter for a Jackpot tea party and a truly enriching experience. Set amidst the flora and fauna of Wonderland, this fairytale-themed slot game is colourful and full of energy. \n\nWith gardens full of mushrooms in the background (as well as playing cards), you'll see card suits as low-value symbols. You'll also see pocket watches, teacups, butterflies, the hare, and the cheshire cat - the latter three appear on top of the cakes. \n\nThere's also the Mad Hatter who pays 0.75, 2.5, or 10 times your bet for 3, 4, or 5 in combination. The hat on a gold coin is the wild symbol that replaces all the above-mentioned symbols. Graphically, Absolootly Mad: Mega Moolah is the first Slot Machine with HD designs and an enchanting soundtrack that makes you feel as though you are in Wonderland. \n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nLet's say that rolling wins are one of the game's extra features. This feature not only occurs in the base game but is also available in the free spin bonus, which triggers an increase in multipliers. \n\nWhen a win is triggered during Free Spins, the next win gets a 3x, the one after 6x, the third win gets 9x, and the fourth and all subsequent wins get a 15x multiplier. \n\nAs for the Free Spins bonus, it's activated by the wooden door, which is the game's scatter symbol. You start with eight spins, but the bonus can be retriggered with three or more doors if they stop further on the reels. \n\nAbsolootly Mad: Mega Moolah is a 5-reel, 3 progressive jackpot row slot with 243 ways to win. Playable from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin, wins are formed by landing 3 or more matching symbols on adjacent reels, regardless of position, starting from the first reel. \n\nHigh variance, the RTP is 92.02%, which is low, but it's a progressive jackpot game - the normal range for a jackpot game is around 94-95%. In terms of hit frequency, it's 32.57%, which means that almost 1 in 3 spins will result in a winning combination. The maximum win is 2,343x your total bet from a free spin - you can win 7 or even 8 figures from the progressive jackpots. \n\nYou can play Absolootly Mad: Mega Moolah on desktop, mobile, or tablet devices - as long as your devices are powered by iOS, Android, or Windows. The 5x3 reel layout works well even on smartphone screens, which helps. You can use the Autoplay feature for as long as you like, but up to 100 spins available. You can also spin with the Quick Spin option. \n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nMega Moolah is one of the most famous online progressive jackpot slots. It was developed and released by Microgaming. It can be played for a minimum of 25 cents and up to 6.25 euros. This slot game features four progressive jackpot prizes, the highest of which allows you to win an astonishing 1,000,000 euros. This game has set a Guinness World Record for awarding the highest online progressive jackpot ever.\n            ",

Join the Mad Hatter for a Jackpot tea party and a truly enriching experience. Set amidst the flora and fauna of Wonderland, this fairytale-themed slot game is colourful and full of energy. \n\nWith gardens full of mushrooms in the background (as well as playing cards), you'll see card suits as low-value symbols. You'll also see pocket watches, teacups, butterflies, the hare, and the cheshire cat - the latter three appear on top of the cakes. \n\nThere's also the Mad Hatter who pays 0.75, 2.5, or 10 times your bet for 3, 4, or 5 in combination. The hat on a gold coin is the wild symbol that replaces all the above-mentioned symbols.

This feature not only occurs in the base game but is also available in the free spin bonus, which triggers an increase in multipliers. \n\nWhen a win is triggered during Free Spins, the next win gets a 3x, the one after 6x, the third win gets 9x, and the fourth and all subsequent wins get a 15x multiplier. \n\nAs for the Free Spins bonus, it's activated by the wooden door, which is the game's scatter symbol. You start with eight spins, but the bonus can be retriggered with three or more doors if they stop further on the reels. \n\nAbsolootly Mad: Mega Moolah is a 5-reel, 3 progressive jackpot row slot with 243 ways to win. Playable from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin, wins are formed by landing 3 or more matching symbols on adjacent reels, regardless of position, starting from the first reel. \n\nHigh variance, the RTP is 92.02%, which is low, but it's a progressive jackpot game - the normal range for a jackpot game is around 94-95%. In terms of hit frequency, it's 32.57%, which means that almost 1 in 3 spins will result in a winning combination. The maximum win is 2,343x your total bet from a free spin - you can win 7 or even 8 figures from the progressive jackpots. \n\nYou can play Absolootly Mad: Mega Moolah on desktop, mobile, or tablet devices - as long as your devices are powered by iOS, Android, or Windows. The 5x3 reel layout works well even on smartphone screens, which helps. You can use the Autoplay feature for as long as you like, but up to 100 spins available.
