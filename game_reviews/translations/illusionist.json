If you don't like to bet so much money, the minimum you can bet is one coin on a single line, remembering that, if you wish, Novomatic offers the opportunity to try this slot machine in demo version, to practice and discover all the tricks before betting real money.\nThe Illusionist slot machine also has a very interesting winning potential, considering that its highest jackpot offers the possibility of a prize worth as much as 5,000 times your bet amount. To try to get your hands on the jackpot, you will have some special functions available, such as stacked Wilds and the free spins system.\n\nSymbols and special features of Illusionist\nThe vintage aesthetics of Illusionist can also be appreciated in the choice of symbols that alternate on the reels: first of all, we have the numbers and letters of playing cards, from 10 to K, to which thematic symbols are added, such as the rabbit coming out of the hat, a white dove, hands performing a card trick and, of course, the face of the illusionist, which pays the most and allows you to get the jackpot equal to 5,000 times the bet.\nThe sparkling white gloves represent the Wild symbol of the game, which replaces all other icons to complete a winning combination.\nThere is no Scatter symbol in Illusionist, but free spins can be won when stacked Wilds appear on the first or fifth reel.\n        ",
