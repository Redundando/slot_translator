    "original_text": "\nIndian Ruby\nIl tema di questa slot machine prodotta dalla software house tedesca Merkur Gaming è quello di un viaggio alla scoperta dell’India. A essere sinceri, c’è da fare un plauso per l’originalità, infatti, non è una tematica molto sfruttata nei giochi di slot, che privilegiano invece da una parte le culture classiche, quali quella egizia o romana, e dall’altra il fascino dell’Oriente (non si contano più, ad esempio, le slot machine a tema cinese).\nIndian Ruby è un viaggio alla scoperta dei colori e dei sapori dell’India, che ha come punto di partenza il focus su uno degli animali che più rappresentano il continente indiano, ossia il maestoso elefante.\nLa schermata inziale si apre infatti con l’immagine di una sorta di corsa di elefanti su una strada polverosa e i pachidermi trovano il loro spazio anche sui rulli della slot.\nLa griglia di gioco invece è posizionata in una sorta di antico tempio, che richiama il rosso dei rubini presenti nel titolo.\nComplessivamente possiamo dire che il compartimento grafico è ben realizzato, con immagini molto nitide e accattivanti e che, seppur mancando particolari effetti speciali o animazioni tridimensionali, visivamente Indian Ruby è più che soddisfacente!\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nIndian Ruby ha una struttura di gioco molto tradizionale con tre rulli e cinque righe, mentre le linee di pagamento sono dieci. Su ogni linea è possibile effettuare delle puntate a partire da solo un centesimo fino a un massimo di 1 €, il che da una parte farà storcere il naso agli high rollers mentre dall’altra renderà contenti i giocatori occasionali o coloro che non amano effettuare puntate elevate.\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP) di Indian Ruby si attesta su un canonico 96,19%, in linea con la maggior parte dei giochi di slot ma niente di particolarmente ghiotto, se comparato con altre slot machine della Merkur Gaming che superano abbondantemente il 97%.\nIndian Ruby è un gioco caratterizzato da una bassa volatilità, come si può prevedere anche osservando il range di scommesse, ciò significa che sebbene ci si possano aspettare delle vincite costanti, sarà veramente difficile che queste possano essere altamente remunerative.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Indian Ruby\nIl gameplay di Indian Ruby è decisamente semplice e intuitivo, e lo si capisce anche osservando i simboli: sono presenti solo due simboli speciali (i tradizionali Wild e Scatter) e nessun Bonus. Le funzionalità oltre il gioco base si limitano ai giri gratuiti e alla possibilità di ottenere alcuni moltiplicatori.\nI simboli con più  basso valore sono rappresentati dai numeri e dalle lettere che si riferiscono alle carte da gioco dal 10 all’Asso, che pagano da 10 a 100 volte il valore della puntata se compaiono su tutti i cinque rulli, mentre quelli con più alto valore sono i simboli legati all’India e includono una pentola, un sacco di spezie e una collana, con pagamenti fino a 500 volte la scommessa.\nIl rubino rosso che dà il titolo alla slot è il simbolo Wild che ha funzione di jolly e regala un moltiplicatore x2 quando contribuisce a realizzare una combinazione vincente. Lo Scatter infine è rappresentato da un maestoso elefante, che oltre a regalare dei giri gratuiti attiva la funzione Respins e permette di ottenere un moltiplicatore di 1000x, ossia la vincita massima a cui si può ambire giocando con questa slot.\n",

Finally, a game that does not rely on the overused themes of ancient Egypt or Rome, or the all-too-common Chinese motifs. Indian Ruby takes you through a colorful journey of the exotic flavors of India, starting with the majestic elephant - an animal that represents the continent. The game opens with a thrilling chase scene of elephants on a dusty road, and these magnificent creatures continue to be featured on the reels throughout the game. The game's grid is set in an ancient temple, highlighted with the hues of rubies - hence, the name Indian Ruby. \n\nThe graphics are expertly crafted, with sharp and enticing visuals. While there is a lack of special effects or 3D animations, visually, Indian Ruby is more than satisfying. \n\nFeatures of the slot machine \nIndian Ruby maintains a traditional game structure, with three reels and five rows. There are ten paylines, and bets can be made starting at only one penny up to a maximum of one euro. This may disappoint the high rollers, but it satisfies casual players or those who don't want to make high bets. \n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of Indian Ruby is at 96.19%, which is consistent with most slot games but isn't particularly impressive when compared to other Merkur Gaming slots that exceed 97%. Indian Ruby is a low volatility game that has consistent winning potential. However, the chances of getting highly rewarding wins are slim. \n\nSymbols and features of Indian Ruby \nIndian Ruby's gameplay is simple and easy to understand, reflected in the symbols used in the game. There are only two special symbols - the traditional Wild and Scatter symbols and no bonus rounds. The extra features offered are free spins and the possibility of earning multipliers. \n\nThe low-value symbols are digit and letter cards from 10 to Ace, paying out from 10 to 100 times the bet value when they appear on all five reels. The high-value symbols are India-themed, including a pot, a bag of spices, and a necklace, offering payouts of up to 500 times the bet. The red ruby, the game's title symbol, serves as the Wild symbol, doubling the win when it contributes to a winning combination. Lastly, the Scatter symbol is a majestic elephant that triggers free spins and Respins feature, allowing you to earn a multiplier of up to 1000x your bet - the highest payout you can score in the game. \n\nIn conclusion, Indian Ruby may not indulge the high rollers, but it provides an immersive experience of the ancient Indian culture, bright and lively graphics, and decent chances of winning.",

To be honest, we must applaud the originality of this game, as it is not a theme that is often explored in slot games. Usually, classic cultures, such as Egyptian or Roman, or the charm of the East, especially China, dominate the slot industry. Indian Ruby, on the other hand, is a journey to discover the colors and flavors of India, with its starting point being the focus on one of the most majestic animals representing the Indian continent -- the elephant.\n\nThe initial screen opens with a picture of a sort of elephant race on a dusty road, with these pachyderms also finding their space on the reels of the slot. The game grid, on the other hand, is positioned in an ancient temple that recalls the red of rubies, which are the focus of the title. Generally speaking, the graphics are well-made, with very sharp and catchy images. Although it lacks special effects or 3D animations, visually Indian Ruby is more than satisfactory for experienced gamblers!\n\nMain characteristics of the slot machine\nIndian Ruby has a very traditional game structure with three reels and five rows, while the paylines are ten. On each line, you can bet starting from only one cent up to a maximum of €1, which may irk high rollers but please casual players or those who do not like to make high bets. The theoretical return to player (RTP) of Indian Ruby stands at a canonical 96.19%, in line with most slot games. However, it is not particularly mouth-watering compared to other Merkur Gaming slot machines that exceed 97%.\n\nIndian Ruby is a game characterized by low volatility, which can be predicted by observing the range of bets. This means that although you can expect constant wins, it will be challenging to achieve highly lucrative ones.\n\nSymbols and features of Indian Ruby\nThe gameplay of Indian Ruby is relatively simple and intuitive, as can be seen through the symbols it uses. There are only two special symbols (the traditional Wild and Scatter) and no Bonus. The functions beyond the base game are limited to free spins and the possibility of obtaining some multipliers.\n\nThe symbols with the lowest value are represented by numbers and letters that refer to playing cards from 10 to Ace, which pay from 10 to 100 times the value of the bet if they appear on all five reels. The symbols with the higher value are those related to India and include a pot, a bag of spices, and a necklace, with payoffs of up to 500 times the bet.\n\nThe red ruby that gives its name to the slot is the Wild symbol that acts as a joker and gives a 2x multiplier when contributing to making a winning combination. Finally, the Scatter is represented by a majestic elephant that not only gives free spins but also activates the Respins function, allowing you to obtain a 1000x multiplier, which is the maximum win you can get while playing this slot.\n            ",

You can bet starting from one cent up to €1 per line. The game has a low volatility rating with a return-to-player (RTP) percentage of 96.19%, which is average for slot games.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nThe game has two special symbols, the Wild and the Scatter. The red ruby represents the Wild; it acts as a joker and has a 2x multiplier when contributing to a winning combination. The Scatter is represented by a majestic elephant that can trigger free spins and activate the Respins function.\n\nSymbol Payoffs\n\nIndian Ruby's low-value symbols include numbers and letters that pay from 10 to 100 times the value of the bet. The higher-value symbols are related to India's traditions and include a pot, a bag of spices, and a necklace, giving payouts of up to 500 times the bet.\n\nRespins Function\n\nThe Respins feature is triggered by the Scatter symbol, allowing players to get a 1000x multiplier, the game's maximum win. This function is designed to help players score big wins.\n\nMaximum Win\n\nThe maximum win in Indian Ruby is obtained by using the Respins function. Players can earn a 1000x multiplier, meaning that if they bet the maximum amount, they can win up to €10,000. However, as a low volatility game, highly lucrative wins are difficult to achieve.\n\n        \n            ",

To be honest, we must applaud the originality of this game, as it is not a theme that is often explored in slot games. Usually, classic cultures, such as Egyptian or Roman, or the charm of the East, especially China, dominate the slot industry. Indian Ruby, on the other hand, is a journey to discover the colors and flavors of India, with its starting point being the focus on one of the most majestic animals representing the Indian continent -- the elephant.\n\nThe initial screen opens with a picture of a sort of elephant race on a dusty road, with these pachyderms also finding their space on the reels of the slot. The game grid, on the other hand, is positioned in an ancient temple that recalls the red of rubies, which are the focus of the title. Generally speaking, the graphics are well-made, with very sharp and catchy images. Although it lacks special effects or 3D animations, visually Indian Ruby is more than satisfactory for experienced gamblers!\n\nMain characteristics of the slot machine\nIndian Ruby has a very traditional game structure with three reels and five rows, while the paylines are ten. On each line, you can bet starting from only one cent up to a maximum of €1, which may irk high rollers but please casual players or those who do not like to make high bets. The theoretical return to player (RTP) of Indian Ruby stands at a canonical 96.19%, in line with most slot games. However, it is not particularly mouth-watering compared to other Merkur Gaming slot machines that exceed 97%.\n\nIndian Ruby is a game characterized by low volatility, which can be predicted by observing the range of bets. This means that although you can expect constant wins, it will be challenging to achieve highly lucrative ones.\n\nSymbols and features of Indian Ruby\nThe gameplay of Indian Ruby is relatively simple and intuitive, as can be seen through the symbols it uses. There are only two special symbols (the traditional Wild and Scatter) and no Bonus. The functions beyond the base game are limited to free spins and the possibility of obtaining some multipliers.\n\nThe symbols with the lowest value are represented by numbers and letters that refer to playing cards from 10 to Ace, which pay from 10 to 100 times the value of the bet if they appear on all five reels. The symbols with the higher value are those related to India and include a pot, a bag of spices, and a necklace, with payoffs of up to 500 times the bet.\n\nThe red ruby that gives its name to the slot is the Wild symbol that acts as a joker and gives a 2x multiplier when contributing to making a winning combination. Finally, the Scatter is represented by a majestic elephant that not only gives free spins but also activates the Respins function, allowing you to obtain a 1000x multiplier, which is the maximum win you can get while playing this slot.\n            ",

Usually, classic cultures, such as Egyptian or Roman, or the charm of the East, especially China, dominate the slot industry. Indian Ruby, on the other hand, is a journey to discover the colors and flavors of India, with its starting point being the focus on one of the most majestic animals representing the Indian continent -- the elephant.\n\nThe initial screen opens with a picture of a sort of elephant race on a dusty road, with these pachyderms also finding their space on the reels of the slot. The game grid, on the other hand, is positioned in an ancient temple that recalls the red of rubies, which are the focus of the title. Generally speaking, the graphics are well-made, with very sharp and catchy images. Although it lacks special effects or 3D animations, visually Indian Ruby is more than satisfactory for experienced gamblers!\n\nMain characteristics of the slot machine\nIndian Ruby has a very traditional game structure with three reels and five rows, while the paylines are ten. On each line, you can bet starting from only one cent up to a maximum of €1, which may irk high rollers but please casual players or those who do not like to make high bets. The theoretical return to player (RTP) of Indian Ruby stands at a canonical 96.19%, in line with most slot games. However, it is not particularly mouth-watering compared to other Merkur Gaming slot machines that exceed 97%.\n\nIndian Ruby is a game characterized by low volatility, which can be predicted by observing the range of bets. This means that although you can expect constant wins, it will be challenging to achieve highly lucrative ones.\n\nSymbols and features of Indian Ruby\nThe gameplay of Indian Ruby is relatively simple and intuitive, as can be seen through the symbols it uses. There are only two special symbols (the traditional Wild and Scatter) and no Bonus. The functions beyond the base game are limited to free spins and the possibility of obtaining some multipliers.\n\nThe symbols with the lowest value are represented by numbers and letters that refer to playing cards from 10 to Ace, which pay from 10 to 100 times the value of the bet if they appear on all five reels. The symbols with the higher value are those related to India and include a pot, a bag of spices, and a necklace, with payoffs of up to 500 times the bet.\n\nThe red ruby that gives its name to the slot is the Wild symbol that acts as a joker and gives a 2x multiplier when contributing to making a winning combination. Finally, the Scatter is represented by a majestic elephant that not only gives free spins but also activates the Respins function, allowing you to obtain a 1000x multiplier, which is the maximum win you can get while playing this slot.\n        ",
