The setting of this slot is the perennial snows of Antarctica, with small icicle stalactites hanging over the grid. The predominant color, blue, can be found in the starry sky in the background, as well as on the reel grid and most of the symbols, impeccably designed by Swintt's graphic designers.\n\nThe accompanying music, a well-crafted, catchy tune, can be turned off at any time in the settings menu.\n\nWhat We Find in Bloxx Arctic\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this game uses the gameplay called Bloxx. In practice, we have two mirrored grids: the first, always active, welcomes symbols and behaves like a normal grid; in the second, we find blocks with amounts that remain immobile for the most part, except for occasional changes. For operation, please refer to the next paragraph.\n\nBoth grids have 5 reels and 3 rows with 30 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is 10 virtual coins, and you can get a maximum win of up to 3,500 times the bet. With the Autospin function, you can activate 10 to 100 automatic spins. For those who want to keep their balance under control, it is possible to set win and loss limits beyond which the automatic game stops.\n\nFrom the same Autoplay page, you can also disable the Gamble function, which allows the player to try to double the win or lose it entirely. In Bloxx Arctic, the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.47%.\n\nDifferent Types of Symbols\n\nIn Bloxx Arctic, we find different groups of symbols that can be summarized as low level, high level, and special. The good poker cards for a straight belong to the first category, while the snowflake, moose, bear, snowflakes, and wolf reward with much higher amounts.\n\nThe specials are the snow girl, our Wild, which replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The icicle is the Scatter, and landing at least 3 of them during the same spin rewards us with 10 free spins. Both of these symbols are also paying.\n\nNow let's talk about the dollar, directly related to the Bloxx function: when at least three adjacent dollar symbols appear on the regular grid, the same positions on the mirrored grid light up, and we win the sum of the amounts contained in the selected blocks. After the win, the winning blocks are removed and replaced by others with new amounts. Additionally, the dollar can be replaced by the Wild to create a winning combo.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow do I activate the Bloxx feature?\n\nEvery time three adjacent dollar symbols land on the regular grid starting from the first reel and moving to the right, we'll win the amounts indicated in the same positions on the mirrored grid.\n\nCan I play Bloxx Arctic on my smartphone?\n\nAbsolutely yes, this slot is available in HTML5 version, suitable for any portable device.\n\nWhat is the maximum win in Bloxx Arctic?\n\nYou can get a figure corresponding to 3,500x the bet.",

The setting of this slot is the perennial snows of Antarctica, with small icicle stalactites hanging over the grid. The predominant color, blue, can be found in the starry sky in the background, as well as on the reel grid and most of the symbols, impeccably designed by Swintt's graphic designers.\n\nThe accompanying music, a well-crafted, catchy tune, can be turned off at any time in the settings menu.\n\nWhat We Find in Bloxx Arctic\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this game uses the gameplay called Bloxx. In practice, we have two mirrored grids: the first, always active, welcomes symbols and behaves like a normal grid; in the second, we find blocks with amounts that remain immobile for the most part, except for occasional changes. For operation, please refer to the next paragraph.\n\nBoth grids have 5 reels and 3 rows with 30 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is 10 virtual coins, and you can get a maximum win of up to 3,500 times the bet. With the Autospin function, you can activate 10 to 100 automatic spins. For those who want to keep their balance under control, it is possible to set win and loss limits beyond which the automatic game stops.\n\nFrom the same Autoplay page, you can also disable the Gamble function, which allows the player to try to double the win or lose it entirely. In Bloxx Arctic, the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.47%.\n\nDifferent Types of Symbols\n\nIn Bloxx Arctic, we find different groups of symbols that can be summarized as low level, high level, and special. The good poker cards for a straight belong to the first category, while the snowflake, moose, bear, snowflakes, and wolf reward with much higher amounts.\n\nThe specials are the snow girl, our Wild, which replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The icicle is the Scatter, and landing at least 3 of them during the same spin rewards us with 10 free spins. Both of these symbols are also paying.\n\nNow let's talk about the dollar, directly related to the Bloxx function: when at least three adjacent dollar symbols appear on the regular grid, the same positions on the mirrored grid light up, and we win the sum of the amounts contained in the selected blocks. After the win, the winning blocks are removed and replaced by others with new amounts. Additionally, the dollar can be replaced by the Wild to create a winning combo.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow do I activate the Bloxx feature?\n\nEvery time three adjacent dollar symbols land on the regular grid starting from the first reel and moving to the right, we'll win the amounts indicated in the same positions on the mirrored grid.\n\nCan I play Bloxx Arctic on my smartphone?\n\nAbsolutely yes, this slot is available in HTML5 version, suitable for any portable device.\n\nWhat is the maximum win in Bloxx Arctic?\n\nYou can get a figure corresponding to 3,500x the bet.\n            ",

In addition, the Bloxx system, which is already known for Bloxx Fruit, has two mirrored grids and unique symbols that make it stand out in the crowded slot market.\n\nWhat We Find in Bloxx Arctic\n\nBloxx Arctic uses two mirrored grids of 5 reels and 3 rows with 30 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is 10 virtual coins, and the maximum win is 3,500 times the bet. This slot is equipped with useful features such as the Autospin function and win/loss limits. Additionally, the Gamble function can be disabled if the player wants to exercise caution. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.47%\n\nDifferent Types of Symbols\n\nBloxx Arctic features different symbol categories such as low level, high level, and special symbols. The low-level symbols include good poker cards for a straight, while high-level symbols are snowflake, moose, bear, snowflakes, and wolf with higher payouts. The special symbols consist of the snow girl (Wild), icicle (Scatter), and dollar (related to the Bloxx function). The Wild replaces all symbols except the Scatter, and landing 3 Scatters during the same spin rewards the player with 10 free spins. Notably, the dollar is directly related to the Bloxx feature, which activates when at least three adjacent dollar symbols appear on the regular grid, and it is explained in the next section.\n\nBonus Feature and How to Trigger It\n\nBloxx Arctic's main bonus feature is called Bloxx, and it is triggered when at least three adjacent dollar symbols land on the regular grid from the first reel to the right. The same positions on the mirrored grid light up, and the player wins the sum of the amounts contained in the selected blocks. After the win, the winning blocks are removed and replaced by others with new amounts. Additionally, the dollar can be replaced by the Wild to create a winning combo.\n\nCompatibility and Accessibility\n\nBloxx Arctic is available in HTML5 version, making it compatible with any portable device such as tablets and smartphones.\n\n        \n            ",

One grid behaves like a normal grid with symbols, while the other features blocks with amounts that stay immobile until activated by adjacent dollar symbols on the first grid.

The game also features special symbols that include the Wild, a snow girl that replaces all symbols except for the Scatter, and the icicle Scatter symbol that activates 10 free spins when you land at least three of them during the same spin.

When activated, the corresponding blocks on the second grid light up, giving the sum of the amounts contained in the selected blocks. Additionally, you get 10 free spins when you land at least three icicle Scatter symbols on any of the reels, where both the Scatter and the Wild are also paying symbols. There is also a Gamble function that allows you to double your wins.\n\nMaximum win potential\n\nThe maximum win in Bloxx Arctic is 3,500x the bet when you land five wolf symbols on a payline. The game has an Autospin function allowing you to activate 10 to 100 automatic spins, and you can set win and loss limits beyond which the automatic game stops. The Gamble function allows you to double your wins in the base game, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.47%.\n\nCompatibility with devices\n\nBloxx Arctic is available in HTML5 version, making it compatible with any portable device.

The setting of this slot is the perennial snows of Antarctica, with small icicle stalactites hanging over the grid. The predominant color, blue, can be found in the starry sky in the background, as well as on the reel grid and most of the symbols, impeccably designed by Swintt's graphic designers.\n\nThe accompanying music, a well-crafted, catchy tune, can be turned off at any time in the settings menu.\n\nWhat We Find in Bloxx Arctic\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this game uses the gameplay called Bloxx. In practice, we have two mirrored grids: the first, always active, welcomes symbols and behaves like a normal grid; in the second, we find blocks with amounts that remain immobile for the most part, except for occasional changes. For operation, please refer to the next paragraph.\n\nBoth grids have 5 reels and 3 rows with 30 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is 10 virtual coins, and you can get a maximum win of up to 3,500 times the bet. With the Autospin function, you can activate 10 to 100 automatic spins. For those who want to keep their balance under control, it is possible to set win and loss limits beyond which the automatic game stops.\n\nFrom the same Autoplay page, you can also disable the Gamble function, which allows the player to try to double the win or lose it entirely. In Bloxx Arctic, the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.47%.\n\nDifferent Types of Symbols\n\nIn Bloxx Arctic, we find different groups of symbols that can be summarized as low level, high level, and special. The good poker cards for a straight belong to the first category, while the snowflake, moose, bear, snowflakes, and wolf reward with much higher amounts.\n\nThe specials are the snow girl, our Wild, which replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The icicle is the Scatter, and landing at least 3 of them during the same spin rewards us with 10 free spins. Both of these symbols are also paying.\n\nNow let's talk about the dollar, directly related to the Bloxx function: when at least three adjacent dollar symbols appear on the regular grid, the same positions on the mirrored grid light up, and we win the sum of the amounts contained in the selected blocks. After the win, the winning blocks are removed and replaced by others with new amounts. Additionally, the dollar can be replaced by the Wild to create a winning combo.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow do I activate the Bloxx feature?\n\nEvery time three adjacent dollar symbols land on the regular grid starting from the first reel and moving to the right, we'll win the amounts indicated in the same positions on the mirrored grid.\n\nCan I play Bloxx Arctic on my smartphone?\n\nAbsolutely yes, this slot is available in HTML5 version, suitable for any portable device.\n\nWhat is the maximum win in Bloxx Arctic?\n\nYou can get a figure corresponding to 3,500x the bet.\n            ",

The setting of this slot is the perennial snows of Antarctica, with small icicle stalactites hanging over the grid. The predominant color, blue, can be found in the starry sky in the background, as well as on the reel grid and most of the symbols, impeccably designed by Swintt's graphic designers.\n\nThe accompanying music, a well-crafted, catchy tune, can be turned off at any time in the settings menu.\n\nWhat We Find in Bloxx Arctic\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this game uses the gameplay called Bloxx. In practice, we have two mirrored grids: the first, always active, welcomes symbols and behaves like a normal grid; in the second, we find blocks with amounts that remain immobile for the most part, except for occasional changes. For operation, please refer to the next paragraph.\n\nBoth grids have 5 reels and 3 rows with 30 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is 10 virtual coins, and you can get a maximum win of up to 3,500 times the bet. With the Autospin function, you can activate 10 to 100 automatic spins. For those who want to keep their balance under control, it is possible to set win and loss limits beyond which the automatic game stops.\n\nFrom the same Autoplay page, you can also disable the Gamble function, which allows the player to try to double the win or lose it entirely. In Bloxx Arctic, the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.47%.\n\nDifferent Types of Symbols\n\nIn Bloxx Arctic, we find different groups of symbols that can be summarized as low level, high level, and special. The good poker cards for a straight belong to the first category, while the snowflake, moose, bear, snowflakes, and wolf reward with much higher amounts.\n\nThe specials are the snow girl, our Wild, which replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The icicle is the Scatter, and landing at least 3 of them during the same spin rewards us with 10 free spins. Both of these symbols are also paying.\n\nNow let's talk about the dollar, directly related to the Bloxx function: when at least three adjacent dollar symbols appear on the regular grid, the same positions on the mirrored grid light up, and we win the sum of the amounts contained in the selected blocks. After the win, the winning blocks are removed and replaced by others with new amounts. Additionally, the dollar can be replaced by the Wild to create a winning combo.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow do I activate the Bloxx feature?\n\nEvery time three adjacent dollar symbols land on the regular grid starting from the first reel and moving to the right, we'll win the amounts indicated in the same positions on the mirrored grid.\n\nCan I play Bloxx Arctic on my smartphone?\n\nAbsolutely yes, this slot is available in HTML5 version, suitable for any portable device.\n\nWhat is the maximum win in Bloxx Arctic?\n\nYou can get a figure corresponding to 3,500x the bet.\n            ",
