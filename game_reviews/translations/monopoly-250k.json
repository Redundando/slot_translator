Monopoly 250k is a 5x5 action-packed game with 40 paylines that offers endless opportunities to win the jackpot. Featuring Mr. Monopoly himself as the game's Wild, Monopoly 250k also features a whole selection of bonus games, activated by the Big Wheel bonus.\nBoard game graphics\nUnless you've been living under a rock for the past few decades, you've probably played Monopoly at some point. It is one of the most beloved board games, so it was only a matter of time before software developers seized the opportunity to merge the popular game into a slot format.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a city, the reels of Monopoly 250k are arranged in a 5x5 grid format. To the right of the reels, Mr. Monopoly stands tall, offering players a thumbs up sign. To the left of the reels is the jackpot table, which adjusts automatically based on the current bet. In the background, fresh and jazzy melodies move, giving the game a sense of elegance and sophistication.\n\nA useful Wild can substitute for other symbols, obtaining a winning line even when it seems that there are not enough symbols to do so. And the range of Bonus games ensures that players will never be bored with the action of the spinning reels.\n\nMonopoly 250k was created and developed by SG Interactive, a company with a great reputation for creating engaging slot games that players love. The company has already introduced players to its popular title Monopoly Millionaire, so Monopoly 250k is the natural successor to that release. And of course, like all SG slot games, Monopoly 250k displays effortlessly on mobile and tablet devices, as well as desktops and laptops, so you can enjoy all your favorite Monopoly gaming action on the go as well.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nSlot enthusiasts love the numerous bonus features and bonus spins that make the gaming experience much more engaging, and Monopoly 250K certainly doesn't disappoint! Most reel spins launch a series of Chance and Mystery symbols - once the reels stop spinning, these question mark symbols disappear, revealing other symbols below them, which could lead to some payouts, depending on the symbols themselves and their placement on the reels.\n\nThere is a completely random Community Chest Bonus that can happen at any time, offering the player a selection of Multipliers to apply to their latest win. Choose one of the three options, and your Multiplier will be revealed, which will increase your jackpot accordingly. Random features like this are of great value, as they add extra levels of excitement to the game - not to mention greater opportunities to get an attractive prize.\n\nThe Big Wheel symbol is the game's Scatter, which has the potential to offer some very tempting delights.\n\nEach window in the game area counts as a separate reel, so rather than five reels of five symbols, the game developers prefer to think of it as a 25-reel game. The Big Wheel Bonus symbol can only appear on the first, thirteenth, and twenty-fifth reels, but when it occurs in all three places during the same spin, the Big Wheel Bonus starts, and the player is awarded a spin.\n\nThe Big Wheel spin can lead to cash prizes ranging from 100x the line bet to 4,000x the line bet, so there is a lot of potential to accumulate an extremely impressive jackpot if luck is on your side. Landing on a property on the Big Wheel will result in a cash prize, but there are also four separate bonuses that can be awarded, resulting in some extra prizes.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to land on the Free Parking Bonus, you will be presented with a garage full of cars - twenty-three to be exact. You will be invited to choose five of them, and each one will reveal a jackpot symbol or a cash amount, with multipliers ranging from 1x to 7x the amount of your bet line. If you are lucky enough to uncover five jackpot symbols, you will receive up to 400x your bet line, making this a potentially very lucrative spin!\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\nSG Digital and Bally's beloved Monopoly slot brand is back with the new Monopoly Heights slot.

A helpful Wild can replace other symbols, getting a winning line even when it seems there aren't enough symbols to do so. Most of the reel spins launch a series of Chance and Mystery symbols – once the reels stop spinning, these question mark symbols disappear, revealing other symbols beneath them, which could lead to some prize payouts, depending on the symbols themselves and their positioning on the reels.\n\nBonus features\n\nMonopoly 250K features a whole selection of bonus games, activated by the Big Wheel bonus. The Great Wheel symbol is the game's Scatter, which has the potential to offer some very attractive delights. The Big Wheel Bonus spin can lead to cash prizes ranging from 100x the line bet to 4,000x the line bet, so there's a lot of potential to accumulate an extremely impressive jackpot if luck is on your side. Landing on a property on the Big Wheel will result in a cash prize, but there are also four separate bonuses that can be awarded, resulting in some extra prizes. If you're lucky enough to land on the Free Parking Bonus, you'll be presented with a garage full of cars - twenty-three to be exact. You will be invited to choose five of them, and each one will reveal a jackpot symbol or a cash amount, with multipliers ranging from 1x to 7x the amount of your line bet. If you're lucky enough to uncover five jackpot symbols, you'll receive up to 400x your line bet, making this a potentially very lucrative spin!\n\nGraphics and design\n\nSet against a cityscape, the reels of Monopoly 250k are arranged in a 5×5 grid format. To the right of the reels, Mr. Monopoly stands, offering players a 'thumbs up' sign. To the left of the reels is the payout table, which adjusts automatically based on the current bet. In the background, fresh and jazzy melodies move, giving the game a feeling of elegance and sophistication. Unless you've been living under a rock for the past few decades, you can't have missed playing Monopoly at some point. The board game-style graphics are well executed, and the game is enjoyable to play.\n\nCompatibility with devices\n\nMonopoly 250k was created and developed by SG Interactive, a company that offers great reputation for creating engaging slot games that players love. Like all other SG slot games, Monopoly 250k displays seamlessly on mobile and tablet devices, as well as on desktop and laptop, so you can enjoy all your favorite Monopoly gaming action while on the go.\n\nSimilar games\n\nIf you're a fan of the classic board game, then you'll love Monopoly Heights slot. The game features a vibrant theme with colorful skyscrapers in the background, and symbols featuring Monopoly money, the Monopoly Man, and Community Chests. There's also a cute retro soundtrack that creates an atmosphere of joy.\n\nJackpot potential\n\nThe Big Wheel Bonus spin can lead to cash prizes ranging from 100x the line bet to 4,000x the line bet, so there's a lot of potential to accumulate an extremely impressive jackpot if luck is on your side. If you're lucky enough to uncover five jackpot symbols in the Free Parking Bonus, you'll receive up to 400x your line bet, making this a potentially very lucrative spin!\n\nOverall impression\n\nMonopoly 250k is an excellent online slot game that perfectly captures the spirit and excitement of the classic board game. The graphics and design are well executed, and gameplay mechanics are straightforward and easy to understand. The game offers a variety of bonus features that can lead to some attractive payouts, including a Free Parking Bonus that has the potential to offer a significant jackpot.

Monopoly 250k is a 5×5 game packed with action and 40 paylines that offers endless opportunities to win the big jackpot prize. Featuring Mr. Monopoly himself as the game's wild, Monopoly 250k also features a whole selection of bonus games, activated by the Big Wheel bonus.\n\nA board game-style graphics: \n\nUnless you've been living under a rock for the past few decades, you can't have missed playing Monopoly at some point. It's one of the most beloved board games, so it was only a matter of time before software developers seized the opportunity to merge the popular game into a slot format.\n\nSet against a cityscape, the reels of Monopoly 250k are arranged in a 5×5 grid format. To the right of the reels, Mr. Monopoly stands, offering players a \"thumbs up\" sign. To the left of the reels is the payout table, which adjusts automatically based on the current bet. In the background, fresh and jazzy melodies move, giving the game a feeling of elegance and sophistication.\n\nA helpful Wild can replace other symbols, getting a winning line even when it seems there aren't enough symbols to do so. And the range of Bonus games ensures that players will never get bored with the spinning reel action.\n\nMonopoly 250k was created and developed by SG Interactive, a company with a great reputation for creating engaging slot games that players love. The company has already introduced players to its popular title Monopoly Millionaire, so Monopoly 250k is the natural successor to that release. And of course, like all other SG slot games, Monopoly 250k displays seamlessly on mobile and tablet devices, as well as on desktop and laptop, so you can enjoy all your favorite Monopoly gaming action while on the go.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine:\n\nSlot enthusiasts love the numerous added value features and bonus spins that make the gaming experience much more engaging, and Monopoly 250K does not disappoint! Most of the reel spins launch a series of Chance and Mystery symbols – once the reels stop spinning, these question mark symbols disappear, revealing other symbols beneath them, which could lead to some prize payouts, depending on the symbols themselves and their positioning on the reels.\n\nThere is a completely random Community Chest Bonus that can occur at any time, offering the player a selection of Multipliers to apply to their latest win. Choose one of the three options, and your Multiplier will be revealed, which will increase your payout accordingly. Random features like this are of great value, as they add extra levels of excitement to the game - not to mention greater opportunities to get an attractive prize.\n\nThe Great Wheel symbol is the game's Scatter, which has the potential to offer some very attractive delights. \n\nEach window on the game area counts as a separate reel, so rather than five reels of five symbols, the game developers prefer to think of it as a 25-reel game. The Big Wheel Bonus symbol can only appear on the first, thirteenth, and twenty-fifth reel, but when it occurs in all three places during the same spin, the Big Wheel Bonus begins, and the player is awarded a spin.\n\nThe Big Wheel spin can lead to cash prizes ranging from 100x the line bet to 4,000x the line bet, so there's a lot of potential to accumulate an extremely impressive jackpot if luck is on your side. Landing on a property on the Big Wheel will result in a cash prize, but there are also four separate bonuses that can be awarded, resulting in some extra prizes.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to land on the Free Parking Bonus, you'll be presented with a garage full of cars - twenty-three to be exact. You will be invited to choose five of them, and each one will reveal a jackpot symbol or a cash amount, with multipliers ranging from 1x to 7x the amount of your line bet. If you're lucky enough to uncover five jackpot symbols, you'll receive up to 400x your line bet, making this a potentially very lucrative spin!\n\nSimilar Slot Machines:\n\nThe beloved Monopoly slot brand from SG Digital and Bally is back with the new Monopoly Heights slot.

Monopoly 250k is a 5×5 game packed with action and 40 paylines that offers endless opportunities to win the big jackpot prize. Featuring Mr. Monopoly himself as the game's wild, Monopoly 250k also features a whole selection of bonus games, activated by the Big Wheel bonus.\n\nA board game-style graphics: \n\nUnless you've been living under a rock for the past few decades, you can't have missed playing Monopoly at some point. It's one of the most beloved board games, so it was only a matter of time before software developers seized the opportunity to merge the popular game into a slot format.\n\nSet against a cityscape, the reels of Monopoly 250k are arranged in a 5×5 grid format. To the right of the reels, Mr. Monopoly stands, offering players a \"thumbs up\" sign. To the left of the reels is the payout table, which adjusts automatically based on the current bet. In the background, fresh and jazzy melodies move, giving the game a feeling of elegance and sophistication.\n\nA helpful Wild can replace other symbols, getting a winning line even when it seems there aren't enough symbols to do so. And the range of Bonus games ensures that players will never get bored with the spinning reel action.\n\nMonopoly 250k was created and developed by SG Interactive, a company with a great reputation for creating engaging slot games that players love. The company has already introduced players to its popular title Monopoly Millionaire, so Monopoly 250k is the natural successor to that release. And of course, like all other SG slot games, Monopoly 250k displays seamlessly on mobile and tablet devices, as well as on desktop and laptop, so you can enjoy all your favorite Monopoly gaming action while on the go.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine:\n\nSlot enthusiasts love the numerous added value features and bonus spins that make the gaming experience much more engaging, and Monopoly 250K does not disappoint! Most of the reel spins launch a series of Chance and Mystery symbols – once the reels stop spinning, these question mark symbols disappear, revealing other symbols beneath them, which could lead to some prize payouts, depending on the symbols themselves and their positioning on the reels.\n\nThere is a completely random Community Chest Bonus that can occur at any time, offering the player a selection of Multipliers to apply to their latest win. Choose one of the three options, and your Multiplier will be revealed, which will increase your payout accordingly. Random features like this are of great value, as they add extra levels of excitement to the game - not to mention greater opportunities to get an attractive prize.\n\nThe Great Wheel symbol is the game's Scatter, which has the potential to offer some very attractive delights. \n\nEach window on the game area counts as a separate reel, so rather than five reels of five symbols, the game developers prefer to think of it as a 25-reel game. The Big Wheel Bonus symbol can only appear on the first, thirteenth, and twenty-fifth reel, but when it occurs in all three places during the same spin, the Big Wheel Bonus begins, and the player is awarded a spin.\n\nThe Big Wheel spin can lead to cash prizes ranging from 100x the line bet to 4,000x the line bet, so there's a lot of potential to accumulate an extremely impressive jackpot if luck is on your side. Landing on a property on the Big Wheel will result in a cash prize, but there are also four separate bonuses that can be awarded, resulting in some extra prizes.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to land on the Free Parking Bonus, you'll be presented with a garage full of cars - twenty-three to be exact. You will be invited to choose five of them, and each one will reveal a jackpot symbol or a cash amount, with multipliers ranging from 1x to 7x the amount of your line bet. If you're lucky enough to uncover five jackpot symbols, you'll receive up to 400x your line bet, making this a potentially very lucrative spin!\n\nSimilar Slot Machines:\n\nThe beloved Monopoly slot brand from SG Digital and Bally is back with the new Monopoly Heights slot.
