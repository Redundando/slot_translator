There's a lot of planning behind every big heist, and game developer Betsoft has clearly planned Take the Bank slot down to the last detail.\n\nStacks of cash, lock-pickers, vault doors, and other themed symbols land on five reels and 75 paylines. When you play Take the Bank slot, watch out for a ticking time bomb that counts down to an explosion of wild symbols on the screen. The arrival of the cops means trouble for the bad guys, but when the feds show up, you'll demand a bounty of free games with extra wild symbols. \n\nA bank heist-inspired graphics:\n \nSkyscrapers pierce the night sky behind an old bank building in the heart of the city. The Take the Bank slot game by Betsoft uses the exceptional graphics we've come to expect from this developer. It's not quite realistic movie-style graphics, but the background is still convincing enough. \n\nA cheerful soundtrack serves as a background. The online slot Take the Bank is a fun game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Some symbols are very comical and cartoon-like, such as the police car and a bank robber wearing a black-and-white striped shirt. \n\nYou can play Take the Bank slot with bets ranging from €0.20 to €20.00 per spin. This means you can't use huge bets, but most of us will find a suitable level somewhere. However, our Take the Bank slot review team discovered an interesting \"Buy\" option. \n\nThis gives you immediate access to the free spin bonus round, with a guarantee of extra wilds. You'll receive 15 free spins with five, seven, or ten wilds in view for 27x, 50x, or 75x your total bet, respectively. It's only an option, and our Take the Bank slot review team found that it doesn't always lead to guaranteed wins on every free spin.\n\nWhatever your bet, the Take the Bank slot machine pays out an average of around 95% in the long run. It's a medium volatility game, although we found that winning spins often coincide with bomb explosions, which we'll talk about more in our review. \n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols: \n\nAlthough standard playing card symbols pay the smaller prizes, the higher-paying symbols are much more imaginative in their design. The crowbar, a red bomb, and the vault door each pay up to 60 coins when they fill a payline. A stack of cash is worth up to 90 coins, and gold bars pay out 100 when they land across the line. \n\nA brilliant blue diamond pays out the biggest prizes. Just two on a line are worth five coins, while a complete set of five will see 300 coins paid out. \n\nAll prizes can be gambled in a double-or-nothing game. If you choose this option, select heads or tails and a coin spins. If you've guessed correctly, the Take the Bank slot game doubles your win and you can collect or continue. \n\nThe online Take the Bank slot is equipped with a fantastic countdown feature. A digital counter on a cartoon bomb at the bottom of the reels goes from 10 to 0 on each set of ten spins. Each robber symbol that appears during the ten spins transforms into a small bomb that locks in position. \n\nThese bombs don't fill entire points on the reels and don't hinder the landing of winning combinations before the clock hits 0. At the end of the ten spins, each collected bomb symbol on the Take the Bank slot game reels starts to shake. Then they explode, leaving wild symbols in their place. \n\nUsually, this leads to some nice winning combinations, as wild symbols act like others to complete combinations. If you have five wilds right across a payline, your reward will be a 300-coin prize. However, our Take the Bank reviewers found that this fun feature doesn't always lead to a win. \n\nOnce the wins are collected, the counter resets and the next batch of ten spins begins. \n\nIf three or more police car scatter symbols appear together, a free spin feature begins. Take the Bank slot rewards 15 free spins, during which five, seven, or ten randomly selected wild symbols are displayed. These are wild symbols that move around the reels on every free spin, and with the potential for ten wilds in their place, you could collect one win after another from this exciting feature. \n\nOther Similar Slot Machines: \n\nOne of the most popular crime-style games comes from the same developer as Take the Bank slot. Heist is another Betsoft crime-themed slot and features the high-level graphics that are a hallmark of the company. \n\nYou might also be interested in playing Microgaming's Bust the Bank slot, which uses animated graphics to bring a fun and fast crime to your desktop PC or mobile device.",

                            "content": "Take the Bank\nCrime-based slot games seem to be increasingly popular, and our review of Take the Bank slot revolves around another bank robbery adventure. There's a lot of planning behind all the biggest heists, and game developer Betsoft has clearly planned Take the Bank slot down to the last detail.\nStacks of cash, lockpicks, vault doors, and other themed symbols land on five reels and 75 paylines. When playing Take the Bank slot, beware of a ticking time bomb that counts down to an explosion of wild symbols on the screen. The arrival of the cops means trouble for the baddies, but when the Feds arrive, you'll demand a bounty of free games with extra wild symbols.\nBank heist graphics\nSkyscrapers pierce the night sky behind an old bank building in the heart of the city. Betsoft's Take the Bank slot game uses the exceptional graphics we expect from this developer. It's not quite photorealistic graphics like in a movie, but the background is still convincing enough.\nA cheerful soundtrack provides background music. Take the Bank online slot is a fun game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Some symbols are very cartoonish and comical, like the police car and a bank robber wearing a black and white striped shirt.\nYou can play Take the Bank slot with bets ranging from €0.20 to €20.00 per spin. This means you can't use huge bets, but most of us will find a suitable level somewhere. However, our team of Take the Bank slot review found an interesting \"Buy\" option.\nThis gives you immediate access to the free spin bonus round, with guaranteed extra wilds. You'll receive 15 free games with five, seven or ten wilds in view for 27x, 50x or 75x your total bet, respectively. It's just an option and our Take the Bank slot review team found that it doesn't always lead to guaranteed wins on every free spin.\nWhatever your bet, the Take the Bank slot machine pays out an average long-term of around 95%. It's a medium volatility game, although we found that winning spins often coincide with bomb explosions, which we'll discuss later in our review.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nAlthough standard playing card symbols pay the smallest prizes, the highest paying symbols are much more imaginative in their design. The crowbar, a red bomb, and the vault door each pay up to 60 coins when they fill a pay line. A stack of cash is worth up to 90 coins and gold bars pay out 100 when seen across the line.\nA bright blue diamond pays the biggest prizes. Only two on a line are worth five coins, while a full set of five will see 300 coins paid out.\nAll prizes can be gambled in a double-up game. If you choose this option, select heads or tails and a coin flips. If you've guessed right, the Take the Bank slot game doubles the win and you can collect it or continue.\nThe Take the Bank slot online is equipped with a fantastic countdown feature. A digital counter on a cartoon bomb at the bottom of the reels goes from 10 to 0 on every set of ten spins. Each robber symbol that appears during the ten spins turns into a small bomb that locks in place.\nThese bombs don't fill whole points on the reels and don't obstruct the landing of winning combinations before the clock reaches 0. At the end of the ten spins, each collected bomb symbol on the Take the Bank slot game reels starts shaking. Then they explode, leaving Wild symbols in their place.\nUsually, this leads to some nice winning combinations as the wild symbols act like others to complete combinations. If you have five wilds right across a payline, your reward will be a 300 coin prize. However, our Take the Bank slot review team found that this fun feature doesn't always lead to a win.\nOnce winnings are collected, the counter resets and begins the next batch of ten spins.\nIf three or more police car Scatter symbols appear at the same time, a free spin feature triggers. Take the Bank slot rewards 15 free games, during which five, seven or ten random Wild symbols appear. These are Wild symbols that move around the reels on every free spin, and with the potential of ten wilds in their place, you could collect one win after another from this exciting feature.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nOne of the most popular crime style games comes from the same developer as Take the Bank online slot game. Heist is another Betsoft crime-themed slot with the high-level graphics that are a hallmark of the company.\nPerhaps you would also be interested in playing Microgaming's Bust the Bank slot, which uses animated graphics to bring a fun and fast-paced crime to your desktop PC or mobile device."

There's a lot of planning behind every big heist, and game developer Betsoft has clearly planned Take the Bank slot down to the last detail.\n\nStacks of cash, lock-pickers, vault doors, and other themed symbols land on five reels and 75 paylines. When you play Take the Bank slot, watch out for a ticking time bomb that counts down to an explosion of wild symbols on the screen. The arrival of the cops means trouble for the bad guys, but when the feds show up, you'll demand a bounty of free games with extra wild symbols. \n\nA bank heist-inspired graphics:\n \nSkyscrapers pierce the night sky behind an old bank building in the heart of the city. The Take the Bank slot game by Betsoft uses the exceptional graphics we've come to expect from this developer. It's not quite realistic movie-style graphics, but the background is still convincing enough. \n\nA cheerful soundtrack serves as a background. The online slot Take the Bank is a fun game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Some symbols are very comical and cartoon-like, such as the police car and a bank robber wearing a black-and-white striped shirt. \n\nYou can play Take the Bank slot with bets ranging from €0.20 to €20.00 per spin. This means you can't use huge bets, but most of us will find a suitable level somewhere. However, our Take the Bank slot review team discovered an interesting \"Buy\" option. \n\nThis gives you immediate access to the free spin bonus round, with a guarantee of extra wilds. You'll receive 15 free spins with five, seven, or ten wilds in view for 27x, 50x, or 75x your total bet, respectively. It's only an option, and our Take the Bank slot review team found that it doesn't always lead to guaranteed wins on every free spin.\n\nWhatever your bet, the Take the Bank slot machine pays out an average of around 95% in the long run. It's a medium volatility game, although we found that winning spins often coincide with bomb explosions, which we'll talk about more in our review. \n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols: \n\nAlthough standard playing card symbols pay the smaller prizes, the higher-paying symbols are much more imaginative in their design. The crowbar, a red bomb, and the vault door each pay up to 60 coins when they fill a payline. A stack of cash is worth up to 90 coins, and gold bars pay out 100 when they land across the line. \n\nA brilliant blue diamond pays out the biggest prizes. Just two on a line are worth five coins, while a complete set of five will see 300 coins paid out. \n\nAll prizes can be gambled in a double-or-nothing game. If you choose this option, select heads or tails and a coin spins. If you've guessed correctly, the Take the Bank slot game doubles your win and you can collect or continue. \n\nThe online Take the Bank slot is equipped with a fantastic countdown feature. A digital counter on a cartoon bomb at the bottom of the reels goes from 10 to 0 on each set of ten spins. Each robber symbol that appears during the ten spins transforms into a small bomb that locks in position. \n\nThese bombs don't fill entire points on the reels and don't hinder the landing of winning combinations before the clock hits 0. At the end of the ten spins, each collected bomb symbol on the Take the Bank slot game reels starts to shake. Then they explode, leaving wild symbols in their place. \n\nUsually, this leads to some nice winning combinations, as wild symbols act like others to complete combinations. If you have five wilds right across a payline, your reward will be a 300-coin prize. However, our Take the Bank reviewers found that this fun feature doesn't always lead to a win. \n\nOnce the wins are collected, the counter resets and the next batch of ten spins begins. \n\nIf three or more police car scatter symbols appear together, a free spin feature begins. Take the Bank slot rewards 15 free spins, during which five, seven, or ten randomly selected wild symbols are displayed. These are wild symbols that move around the reels on every free spin, and with the potential for ten wilds in their place, you could collect one win after another from this exciting feature. \n\nOther Similar Slot Machines: \n\nOne of the most popular crime-style games comes from the same developer as Take the Bank slot. Heist is another Betsoft crime-themed slot and features the high-level graphics that are a hallmark of the company. \n\nYou might also be interested in playing Microgaming's Bust the Bank slot, which uses animated graphics to bring a fun and fast crime to your desktop PC or mobile device.\n            ",

There's a lot of planning behind every big heist, and game developer Betsoft has clearly planned Take the Bank slot down to the last detail.\n\nStacks of cash, lock-pickers, vault doors, and other themed symbols land on five reels and 75 paylines. When you play Take the Bank slot, watch out for a ticking time bomb that counts down to an explosion of wild symbols on the screen. The arrival of the cops means trouble for the bad guys, but when the feds show up, you'll demand a bounty of free games with extra wild symbols. \n\nA bank heist-inspired graphics:\n \nSkyscrapers pierce the night sky behind an old bank building in the heart of the city. The Take the Bank slot game by Betsoft uses the exceptional graphics we've come to expect from this developer. It's not quite realistic movie-style graphics, but the background is still convincing enough. \n\nA cheerful soundtrack serves as a background. The online slot Take the Bank is a fun game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Some symbols are very comical and cartoon-like, such as the police car and a bank robber wearing a black-and-white striped shirt. \n\nYou can play Take the Bank slot with bets ranging from €0.20 to €20.00 per spin. This means you can't use huge bets, but most of us will find a suitable level somewhere. However, our Take the Bank slot review team discovered an interesting \"Buy\" option. \n\nThis gives you immediate access to the free spin bonus round, with a guarantee of extra wilds. You'll receive 15 free spins with five, seven, or ten wilds in view for 27x, 50x, or 75x your total bet, respectively. It's only an option, and our Take the Bank slot review team found that it doesn't always lead to guaranteed wins on every free spin.\n\nWhatever your bet, the Take the Bank slot machine pays out an average of around 95% in the long run. It's a medium volatility game, although we found that winning spins often coincide with bomb explosions, which we'll talk about more in our review. \n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols: \n\nAlthough standard playing card symbols pay the smaller prizes, the higher-paying symbols are much more imaginative in their design. The crowbar, a red bomb, and the vault door each pay up to 60 coins when they fill a payline. A stack of cash is worth up to 90 coins, and gold bars pay out 100 when they land across the line. \n\nA brilliant blue diamond pays out the biggest prizes. Just two on a line are worth five coins, while a complete set of five will see 300 coins paid out. \n\nAll prizes can be gambled in a double-or-nothing game. If you choose this option, select heads or tails and a coin spins. If you've guessed correctly, the Take the Bank slot game doubles your win and you can collect or continue. \n\nThe online Take the Bank slot is equipped with a fantastic countdown feature. A digital counter on a cartoon bomb at the bottom of the reels goes from 10 to 0 on each set of ten spins. Each robber symbol that appears during the ten spins transforms into a small bomb that locks in position. \n\nThese bombs don't fill entire points on the reels and don't hinder the landing of winning combinations before the clock hits 0. At the end of the ten spins, each collected bomb symbol on the Take the Bank slot game reels starts to shake. Then they explode, leaving wild symbols in their place. \n\nUsually, this leads to some nice winning combinations, as wild symbols act like others to complete combinations. If you have five wilds right across a payline, your reward will be a 300-coin prize. However, our Take the Bank reviewers found that this fun feature doesn't always lead to a win. \n\nOnce the wins are collected, the counter resets and the next batch of ten spins begins. \n\nIf three or more police car scatter symbols appear together, a free spin feature begins. Take the Bank slot rewards 15 free spins, during which five, seven, or ten randomly selected wild symbols are displayed. These are wild symbols that move around the reels on every free spin, and with the potential for ten wilds in their place, you could collect one win after another from this exciting feature. \n\nOther Similar Slot Machines: \n\nOne of the most popular crime-style games comes from the same developer as Take the Bank slot. Heist is another Betsoft crime-themed slot and features the high-level graphics that are a hallmark of the company. \n\nYou might also be interested in playing Microgaming's Bust the Bank slot, which uses animated graphics to bring a fun and fast crime to your desktop PC or mobile device.\n            ",

It's only an option, and our Take the Bank slot review team found that it doesn't always lead to guaranteed wins on every free spin.\n\nWhatever your bet, the Take the Bank slot machine pays out an average of around 95% in the long run. It's a medium volatility game, although we found that winning spins often coincide with bomb explosions, which we'll talk about more in our review. \n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols: \n\nAlthough standard playing card symbols pay the smaller prizes, the higher-paying symbols are much more imaginative in their design. The crowbar, a red bomb, and the vault door each pay up to 60 coins when they fill a payline. A stack of cash is worth up to 90 coins, and gold bars pay out 100 when they land across the line. \n\nA brilliant blue diamond pays out the biggest prizes. Just two on a line are worth five coins, while a complete set of five will see 300 coins paid out. \n\nAll prizes can be gambled in a double-or-nothing game. If you choose this option, select heads or tails and a coin spins. If you've guessed correctly, the Take the Bank slot game doubles your win and you can collect or continue. \n\nThe online Take the Bank slot is equipped with a fantastic countdown feature. A digital counter on a cartoon bomb at the bottom of the reels goes from 10 to 0 on each set of ten spins. Each robber symbol that appears during the ten spins transforms into a small bomb that locks in position. \n\nThese bombs don't fill entire points on the reels and don't hinder the landing of winning combinations before the clock hits 0. At the end of the ten spins, each collected bomb symbol on the Take the Bank slot game reels starts to shake. Then they explode, leaving wild symbols in their place. \n\nUsually, this leads to some nice winning combinations, as wild symbols act like others to complete combinations. If you have five wilds right across a payline, your reward will be a 300-coin prize. However, our Take the Bank reviewers found that this fun feature doesn't always lead to a win. \n\nOnce the wins are collected, the counter resets and the next batch of ten spins begins. \n\nIf three or more police car scatter symbols appear together, a free spin feature begins. Take the Bank slot rewards 15 free spins, during which five, seven, or ten randomly selected wild symbols are displayed. These are wild symbols that move around the reels on every free spin, and with the potential for ten wilds in their place, you could collect one win after another from this exciting feature. \n\nOther Similar Slot Machines: \n\nOne of the most popular crime-style games comes from the same developer as Take the Bank slot. Heist is another Betsoft crime-themed slot and features the high-level graphics that are a hallmark of the company. \n\nYou might also be interested in playing Microgaming's Bust the Bank slot, which uses animated graphics to bring a fun and fast crime to your desktop PC or mobile device.\n        ",
