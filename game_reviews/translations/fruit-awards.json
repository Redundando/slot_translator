Per Fruit Awards è stata organizzata una cerimonia di premiazione degna degli Oscar americani. I protagonisti restano i simboli di uva, ciliegie, cocomeri di arance, ma il tocco di genio è di proiettarli in una cerimonia in stile hollywoodiano. La struttura della slot prevede 4 rulli e 81 linee di pagamento sulle quali si possono creare diverse combinazioni pronte a regalare ricchi premi in denaro.\nE’ possibile raddoppiare le vincite più volte durante il gameplay, sfruttando un’alta percentuale di RTP che presenta la slot come affidabile e ricca. Vediamo da vicino che cosa offre questo titolo e soprattutto quali sono i simboli di gioco, le caratteristiche grafiche e funzioni.\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nDal punto di vista grafico questo titolo è semplice ma ben curato, con immagini e animazioni nitide che sanno dare un tocco coinvolgente. Sullo sfondo abbiamo un teatro arricchito da sipario e bordi dorati sui quali si posiziona la griglia di gioco. Propone un funzionamento molto semplice ma anche un layout convenzionale.\nSynot ha pensato di utilizzare il sistema Criss Cross, che è presente in molte slot online, al fine di premiare i giocatori tutte le volte che 3 o 4 icone dello stesso tipo appaiono sui rulli collegati. I pagamenti vengono così calcolati come multipli e la tua scommessa iniziale può aumentare notevolmente il suo valore. Non mancano poi il simbolo BAR e il fortunato 7 rosso che ci riportano indietro nel tempo, un po’ come se ci trovassimo di fronte a una macchinetta vecchio stile. Aggiungiamo anche la presenza di una stella d’oro che funge da Jolly e moltiplica le linee che completa con la sua presenza. Il valore dei simboli principali fruttati varia da 1x per la prima puntata e aumenta nel caso di serie complete di 4 icone, firmando vincite di 4x a scommessa.\nIl numero 7 vale 16 volte se appare sui rulli 1, 2 e 3, mentre si completa una linea di 4 paga 160 volte.\nFunzioni speciali\nLa stella oro è quella più importante per il bonus principale perché completa le combinazioni vincenti e colma eventuali spazi vuoti all’interno di una linea. Può anche avere la funzione di moltiplicatore sulle vincite: se trovi 3 jolly in una stessa linea permette di moltiplicare a 4x la vincita. Se riesci a trovare 3 jolly e un singolo frutto, la vincita è pagata a 8 volte il valore dell’icona. Nel caso del 7 rosso la vittoria vola alle stelle per un valore pari a 1.280 volte la scommessa.\nChi desidera rischiare può trovare pane per i suoi denti con il un round game che segue ogni giro vincente.  Scegli se scommettere la tua vincita o solo una parte per raddoppiare il premio scegliendo di indovinare il colore di una carta da gioco coperta.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Fruit Awards\nFruit Awards è un titolo piacevole che sa unire un tocco classico a una ventata moderna e briosa. Oltre a frutta, BAR e Lucky 7 mette in palio vincite di prestigio, pur contando su un gameplay che è davvero alla portata di tutti. Non è presente la funzione dei giri gratuiti ma la sua assenza non si farà sentire. Synot è riuscita a sopperire a questa mancanza con idee che funzionano al meglio.\n",

Look no further than Synot Games' Fruit Awards slot game.

The gold star symbol is the real MVP (Most Valuable Player) of the game. It can complete any winning combination and fill in any empty spaces like a boss. And that's not all - this shiny star can also act as a multiplier, increasing your winnings by four times if you're lucky enough to match three of them on a payline. </p>\n\n    <p>Of course, there are other classic symbols in the game, like grapes, cherries, and oranges, which are all juicy and delicious. And let's not forget about the BAR symbol - it's not a place to grab a drink; instead, it's a symbol that can lead to big wins. And last but not least, we have the lucky 7, which is a lucky charm that can really bring some fortune your way.</p>\n\n    <p>With all these symbols working together, Fruit Awards really lives up to its name. You might even say it's a fruit salad of symbols, but instead of being served in a bowl, it's on the reels. </p>\n\n    <p>So, if you're feeling fruity and want to try your luck at a classic slot game with some modern twists, give Fruit Awards a spin.</p>\"\n}"
