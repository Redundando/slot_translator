Quando ciò avverrà, il moltiplicatore del rullo utilizzato tornerà al valore di partenza, ovvero 1x. Almeno, ad avvantaggiare questa scelta di gameplay, c’è il fatto che i simboli scatter potranno apparire su ogni rullo, aumentando quindi la probabilità di incontrarli.

The symbols include classic card symbols (A, K, Q, and J) made of stone and vines, and the special symbols are a chameleon, a parrot, an elephant, a tiger, and finally, the gorilla that gives the slot its name. The wild symbol is simply the word “Wild,” and the scatter, a gold medal with a gorilla engraved on it. In many ways, this slot machine is reminiscent of Great Rhino Deluxe, another slot machine by Pragmatic Play that features a medal with the titular animal and animals framed in a similar way.\n\nMultipliers among the vines of Jungle Gorilla\n\nWith an RTP of 96%, Jungle Gorilla offers uncomplicated gameplay that does not include free spins, now a classic feature among slot machines, including those from Pragmatic Play. Multipliers are the central feature of the gameplay, increasing up to 5x whenever a scatter symbol appears on a particular reel, and then transmitted to the wild symbol when it is part of a winning combination. Once this happens, the multiplier returns to its initial value of 1x. At least, the scatter symbols can appear on any reel, increasing the probability of encountering them. Despite its simplicity and subpar graphics compared to other slot machines produced by Pragmatic Play, the multiplier element could attract some players and keep them entertained for a couple of spins.\n\nSimilar slots to Jungle Gorilla\n\nAs mentioned throughout the review, there are many slot machines similar to Jungle Gorilla, some produced by Pragmatic Play.

Among the symbols, we find classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q, and J), this time in stone and covered in vines, which allow us to immerse ourselves even more in the jungle atmosphere.

At the center of the entire gameplay are the multipliers, which will increase on a specific reel (from 1x to 5x) every time a scatter symbol appears, and will then be transmitted to the Wild symbol when it is part of a winning combination. When this happens, the multiplier on the used reel will return to its starting value of 1x. At least, to the advantage of this gameplay choice, scatter symbols can appear on every reel, increasing the likelihood of encountering them. Despite its simplicity and graphics not quite up to the standard of other Pragmatic Play slot machines, the element of multipliers could attract some players and entertain them for at least a couple of rounds.\n\nSimilar slots to Jungle Gorilla\n\nAs mentioned several times during the review, there are many slot machines similar to Jungle Gorilla, also produced by Pragmatic Play. If you want to give it another chance, you could stay in the jungle with Aztec Gems Deluxe, going hunting for lost gems, or you could move to the savannah with the highly successful and aforementioned Great Rhino Deluxe.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and mechanics\n\nJungle Gorilla from Pragmatic Play has a fairly simple gameplay with 5 reels and 3 rows. The game does not feature any free spins, which is a classic among most slot machines these days. The game's main element is the increasing multipliers that increase up to 5x on each reel every time a scatter symbol appears.\n\nSpecial symbols and features\n\nThe slot machine has many animal symbols that are drawn in a somewhat attractive style. Special symbols include a chameleon, a parrot, an elephant, a tiger, and the gorilla that gives the slot machine its name. The wild symbol is easily recognizable as the word 'Wild,' while the scatter is a golden medal with a gorilla engraved on it. The game does not offer any traditional free spins feature, but it has an increasing multiplier feature that makes up for it.\n\nMultipliers and their impact on the game\n\nThe multiplier is the most important feature in Jungle Gorilla. It is a game mechanic that works by increasing the value of each reel up to 5x every time a scatter symbol appears in the game. When a wild symbol is part of a winning combination, it will take the multiplier assigned to that specific reel. The multipliers in each reel return to their default value of 1x once they have been used. The high multiplier values make it possible to win massive rewards, and the chances of winning increase with every spin.\n\nLack of free spins but high RTP\n\nPlayers who enjoy free spin features in their slot machines may be disappointed with Jungle Gorilla's lack of this feature. However, the game makes up for it with an RTP of 96%, which means the returns are decent. The game offers the multiplier feature that can multiply your winnings. Even though the game's graphics may not match other Pragmatic Play slot machines, Jungle Gorilla's simple gameplay and high RTP can keep players entertained for hours.\n\nTheme and visual design\n\nJungle Gorilla has a jungle theme. The game's interface is quite simple, with most of the screen space being taken up by the 5x3 grid. The grid is surrounded by an ancient structure that is covered in vines and moss. Symbols in the game are all inspired by the jungle and include classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q, and J), chameleon, parrot, elephant, tiger, and the gorilla. The design of the symbols is fairly attractive, and the background offers a feel of being in the jungle. The vibe suits the theme of the game perfectly with a unique style that's both naturalistic and game-oriented.\n\n        \n            ",

(4 bullet points)\n- Bullet lists briefly covering the topic \"What we don't like\". (2 bullet pints)\n- SEO optimized meta title with a maximum length of 45 characters. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nJungle theme and animal symbols\n\nJungle Gorilla is a Pragmatic Play's slot game that features 5 reels and 3 rows with various symbols. The game is set in the jungle, as indicated by the few leaves visible in the background. The playing card symbols in the game are designed into stone and vines to fit in with the jungle theme. Other symbols on the reel include animals like a chameleon, parrot, elephant, tiger, and a gorilla, which is the title of the slot game.\n\nMultiplier feature\n\nJungle Gorilla has an RTP of 96% with a straightforward gameplay that does not offer free spins, unlike many slot machines. The slot game has multipliers instead, where the multiplier on any specific reel increases from 1x to 5x every time a scatter symbol appears. At this point, the multiplier is then transferred to the Wild symbol when it is part of any winning combination, and then the multiplier on the used reel returns to 1x. The scatter symbols can emerge on any reel increasing the chances for players to encounter them.\n\nWild symbol with multipliers\n\nThe Wild symbol in Jungle Gorilla is easily recognizable by the word “Wild.” When it appears as part of a winning combination, the multiplier from the used reel is transferred to the Wild symbol, increasing the player's winnings. This game's entire gameplay revolves around multiplying winnings using wild symbols that have multipliers.\n\nAbsence of free spins\n\nOne of the unique features of Jungle Gorilla is that it does not have a free spins bonus round, which is a classic feature in many slot games, including some of Pragmatic Play's other slot games. Its gameplay is centered on multipliers and Wild symbols, which will appeal to some players more than others.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP)\n\nJungle Gorilla has an average RTP of 96%, which is standard for many slot games in the casino industry. While the gameplay is not complex, the frequency of small payouts, combined with Wild symbols and multipliers, creates opportunities for players to invent a strategy that works for them. The chance of winning in Jungle Gorilla is relatively high, and the theme and graphics are satisfactory.\n\n        \n            ",

From facing ferocious animals to searching for lost temples, the options are endless, and Pragmatic Play tries its hand at it once again (after proposing the jungle as the location in many of its other slot games) with Jungle Gorilla. Have they created a product that was not needed or something unexpectedly original?\n\nFace to face with the beasts of Jungle Gorilla\n\nThe interface of the game is dominated by the grid, which takes up most of the screen, leaving very little space for the background, of which only a few leaves belonging to the jungle can be seen. The grid, consisting of 5 reels with 3 lines, is surrounded by an ancient structure covered in vines and moss, and multipliers for each reel are marked on it. Among the symbols, we find classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q, and J), this time in stone and covered in vines, which allow us to immerse ourselves even more in the jungle atmosphere. The special symbols, drawn in a fairly attractive style, are: a chameleon, a parrot, an elephant, a tiger, and finally, the gorilla that gives the slot machine its name. The Wild symbol is easily recognizable, simply being the word \"Wild,\" while the scatter is a golden medal with an engraved gorilla on it. In many ways, this slot machine is very similar to Great Rhino Deluxe, another Pragmatic Play slot machine that also features a medal with the titular animal (though as Wild) and animals drawn and framed similarly.\n\nMultipliers among the vines of Jungle Gorilla\n\nWith an RTP of 96%, Jungle Gorilla presents an extremely simple gameplay that does not even offer free spins, which have become a classic among all slot machines, including other Pragmatic Play ones. At the center of the entire gameplay are the multipliers, which will increase on a specific reel (from 1x to 5x) every time a scatter symbol appears, and will then be transmitted to the Wild symbol when it is part of a winning combination. When this happens, the multiplier on the used reel will return to its starting value of 1x. At least, to the advantage of this gameplay choice, scatter symbols can appear on every reel, increasing the likelihood of encountering them. Despite its simplicity and graphics not quite up to the standard of other Pragmatic Play slot machines, the element of multipliers could attract some players and entertain them for at least a couple of rounds.\n\nSimilar slots to Jungle Gorilla\n\nAs mentioned several times during the review, there are many slot machines similar to Jungle Gorilla, also produced by Pragmatic Play. If you want to give it another chance, you could stay in the jungle with Aztec Gems Deluxe, going hunting for lost gems, or you could move to the savannah with the highly successful and aforementioned Great Rhino Deluxe.\n            ",

From facing ferocious animals to searching for lost temples, the options are endless, and Pragmatic Play tries its hand at it once again (after proposing the jungle as the location in many of its other slot games) with Jungle Gorilla. Have they created a product that was not needed or something unexpectedly original?\n\nFace to face with the beasts of Jungle Gorilla\n\nThe interface of the game is dominated by the grid, which takes up most of the screen, leaving very little space for the background, of which only a few leaves belonging to the jungle can be seen. The grid, consisting of 5 reels with 3 lines, is surrounded by an ancient structure covered in vines and moss, and multipliers for each reel are marked on it. Among the symbols, we find classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q, and J), this time in stone and covered in vines, which allow us to immerse ourselves even more in the jungle atmosphere. The special symbols, drawn in a fairly attractive style, are: a chameleon, a parrot, an elephant, a tiger, and finally, the gorilla that gives the slot machine its name. The Wild symbol is easily recognizable, simply being the word \"Wild,\" while the scatter is a golden medal with an engraved gorilla on it. In many ways, this slot machine is very similar to Great Rhino Deluxe, another Pragmatic Play slot machine that also features a medal with the titular animal (though as Wild) and animals drawn and framed similarly.\n\nMultipliers among the vines of Jungle Gorilla\n\nWith an RTP of 96%, Jungle Gorilla presents an extremely simple gameplay that does not even offer free spins, which have become a classic among all slot machines, including other Pragmatic Play ones. At the center of the entire gameplay are the multipliers, which will increase on a specific reel (from 1x to 5x) every time a scatter symbol appears, and will then be transmitted to the Wild symbol when it is part of a winning combination. When this happens, the multiplier on the used reel will return to its starting value of 1x. At least, to the advantage of this gameplay choice, scatter symbols can appear on every reel, increasing the likelihood of encountering them. Despite its simplicity and graphics not quite up to the standard of other Pragmatic Play slot machines, the element of multipliers could attract some players and entertain them for at least a couple of rounds.\n\nSimilar slots to Jungle Gorilla\n\nAs mentioned several times during the review, there are many slot machines similar to Jungle Gorilla, also produced by Pragmatic Play. If you want to give it another chance, you could stay in the jungle with Aztec Gems Deluxe, going hunting for lost gems, or you could move to the savannah with the highly successful and aforementioned Great Rhino Deluxe.\n        ",
