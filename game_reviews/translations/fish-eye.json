None of them have chosen to develop the game at the bottom of the Nile, except for Pragmatic Play with Fish Eye. It’s almost redundant to talk about the graphics, considering the beautiful games that this provider has offered us over the years. Just a few words, the game grid is located below the water level, with a few vases floating on the surface. The symbols have precise lines and are adorned with numerous details that make the game a little gem.\nFeatures of Fish Eye\nLet's take a panoramic view of the main features of this game. We start by saying that the grid has a traditional cut, with a size of 5x3 and non-modifiable paylines. Each spin costs just €0.10 (€0.01 per payline), but if desired, it can be raised up to a maximum of €375. The maximum win is 10,000x the bet, and all wins that develop from the leftmost reel and proceed towards the right are considered winners. The volatility is high, meaning you win less often on average, but when it happens, the figures are always very substantial. The theoretical return to the player is 96.07%.\nSymbols\nThere are nine base symbols plus two special symbols to create winning combos. There are the classic royals, from 10 to Ace, and they are the symbols of lesser value. Much more profitable instead are the eye, cat, bird, and beetle symbols. The golden fish is a special symbol and takes on a value ranging from 0.1x to 100x. Based on the number of these symbols in a single spin, a multiplier is obtained. Just to give an example, 4 fish give a 1x multiplier, 7 fish 10x, and 15 fish a whopping 2,000x! \nThe Eye of Ra with the pyramid in the background is our Scatter and gives out 10 to 20 Free Spins depending on the number of them that appear. During Bonus play, two symbols will appear on the screen: the golden statue of the pharaoh and Cleopatra. The pharaoh is the Collection symbol, its function is to collect the fish symbols. If 4 appear, they give an additional 10 Free Spins. The other additional symbol is Cleopatra: it is a Removal symbol because it removes low-value symbols from the current game and overall bonus game. This means that until the end of the function, low-value symbols will no longer appear. With two Removal symbols, three additional free spins are obtained.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions \nWhat is the theoretical return to player percentage in Fish Eye?\n\nThe theoretical return to player percentage (Return to Player or RTP) in Fish Eye is 96.07%.\n\nWhat is the maximum win amount in Fish Eye?\n\nIn Fish Eye, the maximum amount that can be won in a single game is 2,000x the bet.\n\nWhere can I play Fish Eye?\n\nThis game can be found in all major Italian casinos with AAMS certification.",

There are the classic royals, from 10 to Ace, and they are the symbols of lesser value. Much more profitable instead are the eye, cat, bird, and beetle symbols. The golden fish is a special symbol and takes on a value ranging from 0.1x to 100x. Based on the number of these symbols in a single spin, a multiplier is obtained. Just to give an example, 4 fish give a 1x multiplier, 7 fish 10x, and 15 fish a whopping 2,000x! \nThe Eye of Ra with the pyramid in the background is our Scatter and gives out 10 to 20 Free Spins depending on the number of them that appear. During Bonus play, two symbols will appear on the screen: the golden statue of the pharaoh and Cleopatra. The pharaoh is the Collection symbol, its function is to collect the fish symbols. If 4 appear, they give an additional 10 Free Spins. The other additional symbol is Cleopatra: it is a Removal symbol because it removes low-value symbols from the current game and overall bonus game. This means that until the end of the function, low-value symbols will no longer appear. With two Removal symbols, three additional free spins are obtained.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions \nWhat is the theoretical return to player percentage in Fish Eye?\n\nThe theoretical return to player percentage (Return to Player or RTP) in Fish Eye is 96.07%.\n\nWhat is the maximum win amount in Fish Eye?\n\nIn Fish Eye, the maximum amount that can be won in a single game is 2,000x the bet.\n\nWhere can I play Fish Eye?\n\nThis game can be found in all major Italian casinos with AAMS certification.\n            ",

Unlike most other Ancient Egypt-themed slot games, Fish Eye offers a captivating and innovative take on the popular theme. The game grid is placed at water level, with a few floating vases on the surface. The graphics are impressive, and the symbols are adorned with numerous details that make the game a little gem.\n\nSpecial Symbols and Multipliers\n\nFish Eye has nine base symbols and two special symbols. The royals, from 10 to Ace, are the symbols of lesser value, while more profitable symbols include the eye, cat, bird, and beetle. The golden fish is a special symbol, and depending on the number of these symbols in a single spin, a multiplier is obtained. For instance, 4 fish give a 1x multiplier, 7 fish 10x, and 15 fish a whopping 2,000x! The Eye of Ra with the pyramid in the background is the Scatter symbol that gives out 10-20 Free Spins, depending on its frequency.\n\nEgyptian Theme at the Bottom of the Nile\n\nFish Eye offers an innovative take on the Egyptian theme by developing the game at the bottom of the Nile. The graphics are breathtaking, and the symbols are adorned with numerous details that make the game a little gem. The game grid is located below the water level, with a few vases floating on the surface.\n\nHigh Volatility for Big Wins\n\nFish Eye has high volatility, meaning that players win less often on average, but when it happens, the figures are always substantial. The maximum win is 10,000x the bet, and all wins that develop from the leftmost reel and proceed towards the right are considered winners. Fish Eye offers players an excellent opportunity to win big, even if it happens less often than low-volatility games. \n\nBonus Play with Golden Statue and Cleopatra Symbols\n\nDuring Bonus play in Fish Eye, two symbols will appear on the screen: the golden statue of the pharaoh and Cleopatra. The pharaoh is the Collection symbol, and its function is to collect fish symbols. If 4 appear, they give an additional 10 Free Spins. Cleopatra, on the other hand, is a Removal symbol because it removes low-value symbols from the current game and overall bonus game. With two Removal symbols, three additional free spins are obtained.\n\n        \n            ",

None of them have chosen to develop the game at the bottom of the Nile, except for Pragmatic Play with Fish Eye. It’s almost redundant to talk about the graphics, considering the beautiful games that this provider has offered us over the years. Just a few words, the game grid is located below the water level, with a few vases floating on the surface. The symbols have precise lines and are adorned with numerous details that make the game a little gem.\nFeatures of Fish Eye\nLet's take a panoramic view of the main features of this game. We start by saying that the grid has a traditional cut, with a size of 5x3 and non-modifiable paylines. Each spin costs just €0.10 (€0.01 per payline), but if desired, it can be raised up to a maximum of €375. The maximum win is 10,000x the bet, and all wins that develop from the leftmost reel and proceed towards the right are considered winners. The volatility is high, meaning you win less often on average, but when it happens, the figures are always very substantial. The theoretical return to the player is 96.07%.\nSymbols\nThere are nine base symbols plus two special symbols to create winning combos. There are the classic royals, from 10 to Ace, and they are the symbols of lesser value. Much more profitable instead are the eye, cat, bird, and beetle symbols. The golden fish is a special symbol and takes on a value ranging from 0.1x to 100x. Based on the number of these symbols in a single spin, a multiplier is obtained. Just to give an example, 4 fish give a 1x multiplier, 7 fish 10x, and 15 fish a whopping 2,000x! \nThe Eye of Ra with the pyramid in the background is our Scatter and gives out 10 to 20 Free Spins depending on the number of them that appear. During Bonus play, two symbols will appear on the screen: the golden statue of the pharaoh and Cleopatra. The pharaoh is the Collection symbol, its function is to collect the fish symbols. If 4 appear, they give an additional 10 Free Spins. The other additional symbol is Cleopatra: it is a Removal symbol because it removes low-value symbols from the current game and overall bonus game. This means that until the end of the function, low-value symbols will no longer appear. With two Removal symbols, three additional free spins are obtained.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions \nWhat is the theoretical return to player percentage in Fish Eye?\n\nThe theoretical return to player percentage (Return to Player or RTP) in Fish Eye is 96.07%.\n\nWhat is the maximum win amount in Fish Eye?\n\nIn Fish Eye, the maximum amount that can be won in a single game is 2,000x the bet.\n\nWhere can I play Fish Eye?\n\nThis game can be found in all major Italian casinos with AAMS certification.\n            ",

None of them have chosen to develop the game at the bottom of the Nile, except for Pragmatic Play with Fish Eye. It’s almost redundant to talk about the graphics, considering the beautiful games that this provider has offered us over the years. Just a few words, the game grid is located below the water level, with a few vases floating on the surface. The symbols have precise lines and are adorned with numerous details that make the game a little gem.\nFeatures of Fish Eye\nLet's take a panoramic view of the main features of this game. We start by saying that the grid has a traditional cut, with a size of 5x3 and non-modifiable paylines. Each spin costs just €0.10 (€0.01 per payline), but if desired, it can be raised up to a maximum of €375. The maximum win is 10,000x the bet, and all wins that develop from the leftmost reel and proceed towards the right are considered winners. The volatility is high, meaning you win less often on average, but when it happens, the figures are always very substantial. The theoretical return to the player is 96.07%.\nSymbols\nThere are nine base symbols plus two special symbols to create winning combos. There are the classic royals, from 10 to Ace, and they are the symbols of lesser value. Much more profitable instead are the eye, cat, bird, and beetle symbols. The golden fish is a special symbol and takes on a value ranging from 0.1x to 100x. Based on the number of these symbols in a single spin, a multiplier is obtained. Just to give an example, 4 fish give a 1x multiplier, 7 fish 10x, and 15 fish a whopping 2,000x! \nThe Eye of Ra with the pyramid in the background is our Scatter and gives out 10 to 20 Free Spins depending on the number of them that appear. During Bonus play, two symbols will appear on the screen: the golden statue of the pharaoh and Cleopatra. The pharaoh is the Collection symbol, its function is to collect the fish symbols. If 4 appear, they give an additional 10 Free Spins. The other additional symbol is Cleopatra: it is a Removal symbol because it removes low-value symbols from the current game and overall bonus game. This means that until the end of the function, low-value symbols will no longer appear. With two Removal symbols, three additional free spins are obtained.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions \nWhat is the theoretical return to player percentage in Fish Eye?\n\nThe theoretical return to player percentage (Return to Player or RTP) in Fish Eye is 96.07%.\n\nWhat is the maximum win amount in Fish Eye?\n\nIn Fish Eye, the maximum amount that can be won in a single game is 2,000x the bet.\n\nWhere can I play Fish Eye?\n\nThis game can be found in all major Italian casinos with AAMS certification.\n            ",
