Non poteva non mancare il moltiplicatore di vincite fino a 666 volte (il numero non è un caso), che rende l’atmosfera di gioco sempre più caratteristica e misteriosa (non dimenticandoci di menzionare anche il simbolo jolly “Mistero).\nSe siete alla ricerca di una piattaforma di gioco virtuale carica di simbolismo e oscura ai massimi livelli, Slotmill può darvi esattamente ciò di cui avete bisogno: se il vostro profilo corrisponde a quello descritto, vi consigliamo decisamente di provare Lucky Lucifer e avrete pane per i vostri denti.\n",

In fact, this slot machine provides us with a clear example of how Slotmill is capable of producing thrilling forms of online entertainment, with some of the best graphics around and many special features, while minimizing the overall weight of this platform, making it perfect for use even on smartphones. This way, you won't even have to worry about when and where you can play Lucky Lucifer, since you can take it with you wherever you go! The main theme of the gaming experience is clear: the symbols and functions all have to do with hell, trying to align themselves in a winning manner to get you up to ten thousand times your initial bet (a feature that is becoming a habit for Slotmill's slot machines).

It is undoubtedly one of the most realistic gaming experiences, thanks to the full HD offered by Slotmill. Everything seems really well taken care of down to the smallest detail, not only when using the game on a computer, but also and especially on a phone (given the latest technologies on the market). The graphics are further enhanced when dealing with very particular symbols, which are described in the next paragraph.\n\nFeatures and symbols of Lucky Lucifer\n\nLucky Lucifer is a slot machine full of wild symbols: these are present in large quantities and all obtainable thanks to the combinations of the symbols of Lucifer and Succubus; just to give you an idea, with each spin it's possible to obtain, in a totally random way, from 1 to 7 wild symbols and it's not easy to find an online slot machine that can offer you such a deal. There could not be a lack of the winnings multiplier up to 666 times (the number is no coincidence), which makes the gaming atmosphere even more characteristic and mysterious (without forgetting to mention the \"Mystery\" wild symbol).\n\nIf you are looking for a virtual gaming platform loaded with symbolism and darkness at its highest levels, Slotmill can give you exactly what you need: if your profile matches the one described, we strongly recommend that you try Lucky Lucifer, and you will have your hands full.\n            ",
