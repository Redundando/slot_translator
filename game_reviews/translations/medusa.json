Many development studios decide to concentrate their energies exclusively on the game mechanics, knowing the importance that this factor represents.\nBut we will never stop saying that the eye also wants its part and that a slot with aesthetic taste is easier to be tried by new players.\nMedusa certainly falls into this category: the frame of the game grid only hints at the Hellenic world, with temples and helmets in the background.

The paylines are twenty-five, a value that falls within the average of online slots and the RTP only slightly exceeds 95%.\nThe aspect that strikes most about this title is the presence of numerous special symbols.

But if we were looking for some similar titles, we could think of 300 Shields (and its variants) always from NextGen Gaming, as well as Age of Gods from Playtech.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay features\n\nMedusa follows the traditional slot gameplay structure with five reels and twenty-five paylines. The RTP slightly exceeds 95%. The special symbols include a Wild symbol, which is the face of Medusa and appears only in the three central reels. Two Scatter symbols, MEDUSA, and Pegasus, allow access to the bonus modes, and the Soldier allows access to the \"Super Spin\" feature.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nNextGen Gaming's Medusa is a visually stunning online slot game. The game grid rotates above what appears to be stone, perhaps a reference to Medusa's deadly power. The background shows a Hellenic world with temples and helmets. The various symbols are illustrated with taste and refinement, making the game a pleasure to look at. The sound of drums that accompanies the game adds to Medusa's immersive gameplay experience.\n\nSpecial symbols\n\nMedusa has several special symbols, including a Wild symbol that replaces all other normal symbols in the game and appears only in the three central reels. Two Scatter symbols, MEDUSA, and Pegasus, allow access to the bonus modes, and the Soldier allows access to the \"Super Spin\" feature. The Scatter symbols present an opportunity to win big in the game.\n\nRTP\n\nThe RTP for Medusa is slightly over 95%, a value that falls within the average of online slots. While the game offers a fair chance of winning, players should always gamble responsibly and within their budget.\n\nSimilar games\n\nThere are numerous online slot games inspired by ancient Greece, including 300 Shields (and its variants) from NextGen Gaming, Age of Gods by Playtech, Aura of Zeus by Bally Wulff, and Disc of Athena also by Bally Wulff. While Medusa shares some similarities with these games, it also offers unique gameplay features that set it apart from the rest.\n\n        \n            ",

The game features a traditional slot layout with five reels and twenty-five paylines, and an RTP of just over 95%. It stands out for its numerous special symbols, including a Wild symbol that can replace all others, two Scatter symbols that activate bonus modes, and a Soldier symbol that triggers the Super Spin feature.\n\nGameplay and features\n\nMedusa's gameplay follows the classic slot mechanics. Players spin the reels, hoping to land winning combinations on the paylines. The Wild symbol, represented by Medusa's face, can substitute for all regular symbols in the game and appears only on the three central reels. The Scatter symbols, MEDUSA and Pegasus, trigger different bonus modes. Finally, the Soldier symbol activates the Super Spin feature, which gives players a chance to win higher payouts. Overall, the game combines traditional slot gameplay with engaging special features.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nMedusa has a well-designed aesthetic, with the game grid located on a stone-like background, perhaps a reference to Medusa's petrifying power. The symbol design is thoughtful and elegant, and the game's accompanying sound effects add to its immersive atmosphere. The game's general theme, inspired by ancient Greek mythology, is subtle but clear and makes this slot visually appealing.\n\nSpecial symbols\n\nMedusa's special symbols add to the excitement and give players more chances to win. Medusa's face, a Wild symbol, can replace all regular symbols. MEDUSA and Pegasus, the two Scatter symbols, activate bonus modes that can lead to bigger payouts. Finally, the Soldier symbol unlocks the Super Spin feature, which increases players' chances of winning even more. Overall, Medusa offers a variety of special symbols that make the game more engaging and rewarding.\n\nOther Ancient Greece-inspired online slots\n\nAncient Greek mythology is a popular theme among online slot games, and there are many titles similar to Medusa. NextGen Gaming also developed 300 Shields and its variants. Playtech offers the Age of Gods series, while Bally Wulff created Aura of Zeus and Disc of Athena. These slots have their unique features and designs, but they all share the common motif of ancient Greece and its mythology.\n\n        \n            ",

We're talking about movies, books, video games, and more: there are more and more titles that exploit the ancient Egyptian, Roman, and Greek populations as themes.\nAnd the world of online slots is no different, we can count hundreds of slots inspired by ancient Egypt and Greece (the Roman Empire is still relatively untapped in comparison) and today's title is precisely inspired by one of the many Greek legends: the myth of Medusa.\nNextGen Gaming takes us back in time and on a fantasy trip, to discover one of the most famous women of all time: with snakes in place of her hair and the power to petrify with her gaze, Medusa is known all over the world.\nLet's discover her again with this slot.\n\nThe visual aspect of Medusa\nLet's start our analysis with the most direct aspect that will strike us: the graphics. Many development studios decide to concentrate their energies exclusively on the game mechanics, knowing the importance that this factor represents.\nBut we will never stop saying that the eye also wants its part and that a slot with aesthetic taste is easier to be tried by new players.\nMedusa certainly falls into this category: the frame of the game grid only hints at the Hellenic world, with temples and helmets in the background. The game grid rotates above what appears to be stone (perhaps a reference to Medusa's deadly power) and the various symbols are illustrated with taste and refinement.\nOur play is accompanied by the sound of drums that make us feel like we are at war, in short: NextGen Gaming's Medusa proves to be a pleasant slot to look at before actually trying the game. Let's see if the gameplay mechanics are on the same level.\n\nHow to play Medusa\nWhat we have in front of us is a traditional slot, with five reels that spin on themselves and each displaying three symbols per play. The paylines are twenty-five, a value that falls within the average of online slots and the RTP only slightly exceeds 95%.\nThe aspect that strikes most about this title is the presence of numerous special symbols. We obviously start with the same Medusa: the enchanting face of the woman is a Wild symbol capable of replacing all the other normal symbols in the game. It appears only in the three central reels.\nThe title of the slot, MEDUSA, and the winged horse Pegasus are two Scatter symbols that allow access to the bonus modes and the Soldier allows access to the \"Super Spin\" feature.\nA slot, therefore, to be tried out, which demonstrates as much care in graphic details as in gameplay mechanics.\n\nSlots similar to Medusa\nAs we established at the beginning of this review, the pantheon of slots themed \"Ancient Greece\" is very crowded, so it's not possible to list them all. But if we were looking for some similar titles, we could think of 300 Shields (and its variants) always from NextGen Gaming, as well as Age of Gods from Playtech. Or even Aura of Zeus from Bally Wulff, a company that also proposes Disc of Athena.\n            ",

We're talking about movies, books, video games, and more: there are more and more titles that exploit the ancient Egyptian, Roman, and Greek populations as themes.\nAnd the world of online slots is no different, we can count hundreds of slots inspired by ancient Egypt and Greece (the Roman Empire is still relatively untapped in comparison) and today's title is precisely inspired by one of the many Greek legends: the myth of Medusa.\nNextGen Gaming takes us back in time and on a fantasy trip, to discover one of the most famous women of all time: with snakes in place of her hair and the power to petrify with her gaze, Medusa is known all over the world.\nLet's discover her again with this slot.\n\nThe visual aspect of Medusa\nLet's start our analysis with the most direct aspect that will strike us: the graphics. Many development studios decide to concentrate their energies exclusively on the game mechanics, knowing the importance that this factor represents.\nBut we will never stop saying that the eye also wants its part and that a slot with aesthetic taste is easier to be tried by new players.\nMedusa certainly falls into this category: the frame of the game grid only hints at the Hellenic world, with temples and helmets in the background. The game grid rotates above what appears to be stone (perhaps a reference to Medusa's deadly power) and the various symbols are illustrated with taste and refinement.\nOur play is accompanied by the sound of drums that make us feel like we are at war, in short: NextGen Gaming's Medusa proves to be a pleasant slot to look at before actually trying the game. Let's see if the gameplay mechanics are on the same level.\n\nHow to play Medusa\nWhat we have in front of us is a traditional slot, with five reels that spin on themselves and each displaying three symbols per play. The paylines are twenty-five, a value that falls within the average of online slots and the RTP only slightly exceeds 95%.\nThe aspect that strikes most about this title is the presence of numerous special symbols. We obviously start with the same Medusa: the enchanting face of the woman is a Wild symbol capable of replacing all the other normal symbols in the game. It appears only in the three central reels.\nThe title of the slot, MEDUSA, and the winged horse Pegasus are two Scatter symbols that allow access to the bonus modes and the Soldier allows access to the \"Super Spin\" feature.\nA slot, therefore, to be tried out, which demonstrates as much care in graphic details as in gameplay mechanics.\n\nSlots similar to Medusa\nAs we established at the beginning of this review, the pantheon of slots themed \"Ancient Greece\" is very crowded, so it's not possible to list them all. But if we were looking for some similar titles, we could think of 300 Shields (and its variants) always from NextGen Gaming, as well as Age of Gods from Playtech. Or even Aura of Zeus from Bally Wulff, a company that also proposes Disc of Athena.\n        ",
