First of all, as in the other game, you will find the option of +5 paylines, which gives you 30 paylines instead of the standard 25. Our advice is not to miss out on these extra paylines, as they will increase the RTP by a good percentage, increasing your chances of winning.

The More Hearts Bonus Round will be activated as soon as 3 or more More Hearts Scatter symbols land anywhere on the reels.

If you want to go straight to real money, just select one of our AAMS certified casinos in the list and choose from the numerous Welcome Bonuses and Bonuses with or without Deposits available in each of them.\n            ",

Although its name may suggest a romantic storyline, the central theme is quite varied, ranging from images of wild animals such as lions and birds to glittering precious stones scattered on the reels. Perhaps the developer's idea was to include the most beloved and desired elements in a single online slot game.\n\nGameplay of More Hearts\nDespite the uniqueness of the game, the no-download More Hearts slot game resembles in several aspects the spicy Aristocrat slot game entitled More Chilli, which is available in our list. First of all, as in the other game, you will find the option of +5 paylines, which gives you 30 paylines instead of the standard 25. Our advice is not to miss out on these extra paylines, as they will increase the RTP by a good percentage, increasing your chances of winning. Just click on the + sign under the LINE header and you're done!\n\nMain Symbols\nSeveral standard and extra symbols are present in the free slot game More Hearts, let's see them together:\n\nPlaying Card Icons - 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, and Ace,\nMachine Logo - this is the game's Scatter,\nWild Icons - in an alternating color sequence, fun Wild icons appear, such as the Yellow Rose, Butterflies, Leopards, and the precious Diamond, all of which are essential elements to give you additional advantages during your bets.\n\nMore Hearts Bonus Rounds\nWin 15 free spins in the More Hearts Free Spins Bonus Round! The More Hearts Bonus Round will be activated as soon as 3 or more More Hearts Scatter symbols land anywhere on the reels. You will be awarded 15 free spins if you have chosen the 5 extra paylines, and the screen will be divided into four parts with two games ready to start simultaneously.\n\nExtra Game\nIf you manage to land 9 hearts in the free spins rounds in rapid succession, you could get four games with free spins, turning this online slot game into a truly rewarding multi-game platform.\n\nOur point of view\nIf you are a fan of Aristocrat's free slot games, we recommend trying to play More Hearts, taking advantage of the original extra game with multi-game mode. If you want to go straight to real money, just select one of our AAMS certified casinos in the list and choose from the numerous Welcome Bonuses and Bonuses with or without Deposits available in each of them.\n            ",
