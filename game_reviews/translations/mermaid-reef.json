A fare da sfondo a questa bellissima slot, c’è la caratteristica barriera corallina, più precisamente la scogliera della sirena, luogo suggestivo meta di numerosi turisti provenienti da tutto il mondo. Cominciamo subito dicendo che la parola d’ordine di Mermaid Reef è semplicità, a partire dalla grafica, che risulta essere elaborata ma senza grandi effetti speciali. La griglia si trova sul fondo del mare, circondata dalla flora del posto. Il sottofondo musicale è molto rilassante e piacevole, adatto a chi non ama le slot con numerosi effetti sonori, spesso giudicati disturbanti dai giocatori. Il tasto Start si trova sul lato destro rispetto ai rulli e sotto la griglia troviamo il riassunto della puntata. Per settare al meglio la nostra scommessa è però necessario accedere al menù interno attraverso l’apposito pulsante.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nCome detto in precedenza, è stata la semplicità a guidare gli sviluppatori della ReelPlay quando hanno deciso di creare questa slot. La griglia ha 5 rulli e 3 righe, con 10 linee di pagamento fisse e una scommessa che parte da 10 gettoni sino a un massimo di 10.000. Dotata di Autoplay, è possibile impostare tra i 5 e i 100 giri automatici senza dover per forza impostare qualche limite. Un buon RTP del 95,9% e una volatilità alta fanno di Mermaid Reef una slot in grado di regalarci vincite abbastanza frequenti.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nI simboli base sono 10 in tutto, i primi 6 che rappresentano le carte da gioco dal 9 all’asso e gli altri 4 a tema mare. Come di consueto, i simboli non tematici hanno un valore basso, ma a partire dalla medusa e proseguendo con la stella, il pesce pagliaccio e il delfino le cifre si fanno molto più interessanti. La sirena è il nostro simbolo Wild, copre l’intero rullo e sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto quelli speciali. Può comparire soltanto sui rulli 2, 3 e 4. Un altro simbolo speciale è quello Scattered Pearl, una perla rosa pulsante che può regalarci 10, 15 o 20 Free Spins, durante i quali tutte le vincite verranno moltiplicate per 2.\nL’ostrica è invece il nostro simbolo detto Scatter Clam. Esso può comparire solo sui rulli 2, 3 e 4 e ricompensa con un gioco bonus che può farci vincere premi da capogiro. Se sui rulli atterrano 3 Scattered Clam, allora vedremo apparire sullo schermo 15 ostriche chiuso. Il nostro compito sarà quello di aprirle una alla volta. All’interno potremo trovare delle perle di diverso colore:\n• Bianca, che ci ricompensa con un moltiplicatore compreso tra 1x e 20x\n• Nera, che paga con un moltiplicatore compreso tra 2x e 25x ma che farà anche concludere il gioco.\n• Dorata che paga con un moltiplicatore compreso tra 50x e 1.000x.\n",

The characteristic coral reef, more precisely the mermaid's cliff, is the background of this beautiful slot, a suggestive place visited by numerous tourists from all over the world. Let's start by saying that the watchword of Mermaid Reef is simplicity, starting from the graphics, which are elaborate but without major special effects. The grid is located on the seabed, surrounded by local flora. The background music is very relaxing and pleasant, suitable for those who do not like slots with numerous sound effects often considered disturbing by players. The Start button is located on the right side compared to the reels and below the grid, we find a summary of the bet. However, to set our bet well, it is necessary to access the internal menu through the appropriate button.\nSlot features:\nAs mentioned earlier, simplicity guided the ReelPlay developers when they decided to create this slot. The grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 10 fixed pay lines and a bet that starts from 10 coins up to a maximum of 10,000. Equipped with Autoplay, you can set between 5 and 100 automatic spins without necessarily setting any limits. A good RTP of 95.9% and high volatility make Mermaid Reef a slot machine capable of giving quite frequent wins.\nSymbols and features:\nThere are 10 basic symbols in total, the first 6 representing playing cards from 9 to Ace and the other 4, sea-themed. As usual, non-themed symbols have a low value, but starting from the jellyfish and continuing with the star, the clownfish, and the dolphin, the figures become much more interesting. The mermaid is our Wild symbol, covers the entire reel, and replaces all symbols except the special ones. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. Another special symbol is the Scattered Pearl, a pulsating pink pearl that can give us 10, 15, or 20 Free Spins, during which all winnings will be multiplied by 2.\nThe clam is our Scatter Clam symbol. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 and rewards with a bonus game that can make us win dizzying prizes. If 3 Scattered Clams land on the reels, we will see 15 closed oysters appear on the screen. Our task will be to open them one at a time. Inside, we can find pearls of different colors:\n• White, which rewards us with a multiplier between 1x and 20x\n• Black, which pays with a multiplier between 2x and 25x but also makes the game end.\n• Gold that pays with a multiplier between 50x and 1,000x.",

The background of this beautiful slot is the characteristic coral reef, more precisely the mermaid's cliff, a suggestive place visited by many tourists from all over the world. Let's start by saying that the keyword of Mermaid Reef is simplicity, starting from the graphics, which are elaborate but without big special effects. The grid is located at the bottom of the sea, surrounded by the local flora. The musical background is very relaxing and pleasant, suitable for those who do not like slots with numerous sound effects, often considered disturbing by players. The Start button is located on the right side of the reels and below the grid we find a summary of the bet. However, to set our bet to the best it can be, it is necessary to access the internal menu through the appropriate button.\n\nSlot features\n\nAs previously mentioned, simplicity guided ReelPlay developers when they decided to create this slot. The grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 10 fixed paylines and a bet that starts from 10 coins up to a maximum of 10,000. Equipped with Autoplay, it is possible to set between 5 and 100 automatic spins without having to set any limits. A good RTP of 95.9% and high volatility make Mermaid Reef a slot capable of giving us quite frequent winnings.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nThere are 10 basic symbols in total, the first 6 representing playing cards from 9 to Ace and the other 4 themed sea symbols. As usual, non-themed symbols have a low value, but starting from the jellyfish and continuing with the starfish, the clownfish, and the dolphin, the figures become much more interesting. The mermaid is our Wild symbol, covering the entire reel and replacing all symbols except for the special ones. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. Another special symbol is the Scattered Pearl, a pulsating pink pearl that can give us 10, 15, or 20 Free Spins, during which all winnings will be multiplied by 2.\n\nThe clam is instead our Scatter Clam symbol. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 and rewards with a bonus game that can make us win dizzying prizes. If 3 Scattered Clams land on the reels, we will see 15 closed oysters appear on the screen. Our task will be to open them one by one. Inside, we may find pearls of different colors:\n\n• White, which rewards us with a multiplier ranging from 1x to 20x\n• Black, which pays with a multiplier ranging from 2x to 25x, but also ends the game.\n• Golden, which pays with a multiplier ranging from 50x to 1,000x.\n            ",

It's essential to keep in mind that high volatility slots tend to have longer losing streaks before players can hit a significant win.\n\n        \n            ",

The background of this beautiful slot is the characteristic coral reef, more precisely the mermaid's cliff, a suggestive place visited by many tourists from all over the world. Let's start by saying that the keyword of Mermaid Reef is simplicity, starting from the graphics, which are elaborate but without big special effects. The grid is located at the bottom of the sea, surrounded by the local flora. The musical background is very relaxing and pleasant, suitable for those who do not like slots with numerous sound effects, often considered disturbing by players. The Start button is located on the right side of the reels and below the grid we find a summary of the bet. However, to set our bet to the best it can be, it is necessary to access the internal menu through the appropriate button.\n\nSlot features\n\nAs previously mentioned, simplicity guided ReelPlay developers when they decided to create this slot. The grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 10 fixed paylines and a bet that starts from 10 coins up to a maximum of 10,000. Equipped with Autoplay, it is possible to set between 5 and 100 automatic spins without having to set any limits. A good RTP of 95.9% and high volatility make Mermaid Reef a slot capable of giving us quite frequent winnings.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nThere are 10 basic symbols in total, the first 6 representing playing cards from 9 to Ace and the other 4 themed sea symbols. As usual, non-themed symbols have a low value, but starting from the jellyfish and continuing with the starfish, the clownfish, and the dolphin, the figures become much more interesting. The mermaid is our Wild symbol, covering the entire reel and replacing all symbols except for the special ones. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. Another special symbol is the Scattered Pearl, a pulsating pink pearl that can give us 10, 15, or 20 Free Spins, during which all winnings will be multiplied by 2.\n\nThe clam is instead our Scatter Clam symbol. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 and rewards with a bonus game that can make us win dizzying prizes. If 3 Scattered Clams land on the reels, we will see 15 closed oysters appear on the screen. Our task will be to open them one by one. Inside, we may find pearls of different colors:\n\n• White, which rewards us with a multiplier ranging from 1x to 20x\n• Black, which pays with a multiplier ranging from 2x to 25x, but also ends the game.\n• Golden, which pays with a multiplier ranging from 50x to 1,000x.\n            ",

It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 and rewards with a bonus game that can make us win dizzying prizes. If 3 Scattered Clams land on the reels, we will see 15 closed oysters appear on the screen. Our task will be to open them one by one. Inside, we may find pearls of different colors:\n\n• White, which rewards us with a multiplier ranging from 1x to 20x\n• Black, which pays with a multiplier ranging from 2x to 25x, but also ends the game.\n• Golden, which pays with a multiplier ranging from 50x to 1,000x.\n        ",
