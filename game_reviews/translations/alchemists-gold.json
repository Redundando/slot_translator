The player will only have to predict whether the drawn card will have a red or black suit: with the right choice, you will double, while if you're wrong, you'll crash your dreams of glory. You risk losing all the money you accumulated.\n\nFinal thoughts on the slot\nIt's true that this video slot lacks features that would spice up its gameplay a little, but its Wild will fill the absence of free spins and bonuses. Alchemist's Gold boasts a good appearance, good graphics, and the presence of a mysterious symbol that manages to appear on the reels quite often. And this means being able to win extra prizes that never hurt. It pleases with its small details and its ability to intrigue players even without relying on special animations or effects. It certainly won't bring overturning wealth, but entertainment is guaranteed.\n        ",

Not a bad thought, right? You can try it out with Alchemist's Gold, which allows players to dream of important wealth starting from metal. Synot Games created this slot, which starts with a normal structure of 5 reels and 10 lines to present some pleasant gifts to gamers.\n\nAlthough the slot is basic, it includes a Mystery Symbol function that is ideal for creating winning combinations. And if you love to challenge yourself and put yourself to the test, you can also try to multiply your winnings over and over again by betting what you have conquered.\n\nBelow we will talk about the features of this modern-like title, which, in addition to symbols that reflect the chosen theme, also offers the inevitable cards. Among elements such as earth, air, fire, and water, you can transform symbols and push yourself higher and higher.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe graphics are well-crafted, making this video slot truly unique for the industry. Alchemist's Gold focuses on the value of its icons: starting with the playing cards, which range from J or Q and appear on reels 3, 4, or 5, guaranteeing up to 1x, 2x, or 10 times the bet. Then we move up to K and A to get instead 2x, 5x, or 15x, but to aim for something more important, you will need to land the official symbols of the game. The Earth is represented by a tree on a hill, while the tornado is the symbol of the Air, and for each, you will have 3x, 8x, or 25x the amount of the bet. But they will have to be positioned on reels 3, 4, or 5. And water? It is shown with a giant wave that brings with it a value equal to 5x, 10x, or 30x. We then have fire, which is worth 5x, 20x, or 40x, and a pink luminous vial that gives 10, 20, or 50 times the bet.\n\nBut let's not forget the importance of the mysterious symbol: what can it offer you? Its power is to transform into any other image selected randomly, thus increasing the chance of making the winnings. However, when tested, the bonus seems a bit inconsistent, but one should not give up: the moment it pays, it will do so in a unique way.\n\nSpecial features\nOne of the strengths of Synot Games is to offer an additional round of pure chance: do you want to double?

Not a bad thought, right? You can try it out with Alchemist's Gold, which allows players to dream of important wealth starting from metal. Synot Games created this slot, which starts with a normal structure of 5 reels and 10 lines to present some pleasant gifts to gamers.\n\nAlthough the slot is basic, it includes a Mystery Symbol function that is ideal for creating winning combinations. And if you love to challenge yourself and put yourself to the test, you can also try to multiply your winnings over and over again by betting what you have conquered.\n\nBelow we will talk about the features of this modern-like title, which, in addition to symbols that reflect the chosen theme, also offers the inevitable cards. Among elements such as earth, air, fire, and water, you can transform symbols and push yourself higher and higher.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe graphics are well-crafted, making this video slot truly unique for the industry. Alchemist's Gold focuses on the value of its icons: starting with the playing cards, which range from J or Q and appear on reels 3, 4, or 5, guaranteeing up to 1x, 2x, or 10 times the bet. Then we move up to K and A to get instead 2x, 5x, or 15x, but to aim for something more important, you will need to land the official symbols of the game. The Earth is represented by a tree on a hill, while the tornado is the symbol of the Air, and for each, you will have 3x, 8x, or 25x the amount of the bet. But they will have to be positioned on reels 3, 4, or 5. And water? It is shown with a giant wave that brings with it a value equal to 5x, 10x, or 30x. We then have fire, which is worth 5x, 20x, or 40x, and a pink luminous vial that gives 10, 20, or 50 times the bet.\n\nBut let's not forget the importance of the mysterious symbol: what can it offer you? Its power is to transform into any other image selected randomly, thus increasing the chance of making the winnings. However, when tested, the bonus seems a bit inconsistent, but one should not give up: the moment it pays, it will do so in a unique way.\n\nSpecial features\nOne of the strengths of Synot Games is to offer an additional round of pure chance: do you want to double? You can do it with a 50/50 game that is risky but can make you win a lot. The player will only have to predict whether the drawn card will have a red or black suit: with the right choice, you will double, while if you're wrong, you'll crash your dreams of glory. You risk losing all the money you accumulated.\n\nFinal thoughts on the slot\nIt's true that this video slot lacks features that would spice up its gameplay a little, but its Wild will fill the absence of free spins and bonuses. Alchemist's Gold boasts a good appearance, good graphics, and the presence of a mysterious symbol that manages to appear on the reels quite often. And this means being able to win extra prizes that never hurt. It pleases with its small details and its ability to intrigue players even without relying on special animations or effects. It certainly won't bring overturning wealth, but entertainment is guaranteed.\n            ",

Not a bad thought, right? You can try it out with Alchemist's Gold, which allows players to dream of important wealth starting from metal. Synot Games created this slot, which starts with a normal structure of 5 reels and 10 lines to present some pleasant gifts to gamers.\n\nAlthough the slot is basic, it includes a Mystery Symbol function that is ideal for creating winning combinations. And if you love to challenge yourself and put yourself to the test, you can also try to multiply your winnings over and over again by betting what you have conquered.\n\nBelow we will talk about the features of this modern-like title, which, in addition to symbols that reflect the chosen theme, also offers the inevitable cards. Among elements such as earth, air, fire, and water, you can transform symbols and push yourself higher and higher.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe graphics are well-crafted, making this video slot truly unique for the industry. Alchemist's Gold focuses on the value of its icons: starting with the playing cards, which range from J or Q and appear on reels 3, 4, or 5, guaranteeing up to 1x, 2x, or 10 times the bet. Then we move up to K and A to get instead 2x, 5x, or 15x, but to aim for something more important, you will need to land the official symbols of the game. The Earth is represented by a tree on a hill, while the tornado is the symbol of the Air, and for each, you will have 3x, 8x, or 25x the amount of the bet. But they will have to be positioned on reels 3, 4, or 5. And water? It is shown with a giant wave that brings with it a value equal to 5x, 10x, or 30x. We then have fire, which is worth 5x, 20x, or 40x, and a pink luminous vial that gives 10, 20, or 50 times the bet.\n\nBut let's not forget the importance of the mysterious symbol: what can it offer you? Its power is to transform into any other image selected randomly, thus increasing the chance of making the winnings. However, when tested, the bonus seems a bit inconsistent, but one should not give up: the moment it pays, it will do so in a unique way.\n\nSpecial features\nOne of the strengths of Synot Games is to offer an additional round of pure chance: do you want to double? You can do it with a 50/50 game that is risky but can make you win a lot. The player will only have to predict whether the drawn card will have a red or black suit: with the right choice, you will double, while if you're wrong, you'll crash your dreams of glory. You risk losing all the money you accumulated.\n\nFinal thoughts on the slot\nIt's true that this video slot lacks features that would spice up its gameplay a little, but its Wild will fill the absence of free spins and bonuses. Alchemist's Gold boasts a good appearance, good graphics, and the presence of a mysterious symbol that manages to appear on the reels quite often. And this means being able to win extra prizes that never hurt. It pleases with its small details and its ability to intrigue players even without relying on special animations or effects. It certainly won't bring overturning wealth, but entertainment is guaranteed.\n            ",
