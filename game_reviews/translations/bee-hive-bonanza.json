With Bee Hive, we are immersed in nature, thanks to a game dedicated to bees. The loveable cartoon version of these insects makes for a very enjoyable and entertaining game. Additionally, the high-quality graphics, as always with NetEnt, make the experience even more immersive!\n\nIn Bee Hive Bonanza, the theme of bees is fused with that of the Middle Ages. Bees are dressed as kings or jesters, the grid is located within a castle, and the symbols look like knightly effigies.\n\nFeatures of Bee Hive Bonanza\n\nThe grid is square in shape with 5 reels and 5 rows, and to win, you need to create combos of at least 6 symbols. The game system is cascade, which means that every time we get a winning combination, the paying symbols disappear and are replaced by others.\n\nThe minimum bet is 0.10 €, the maximum is 3 €. Among the most interesting functions we find Autoplay and the turbo function, which allows us to speed up the rotation of the reels.\n\nA swarm of Bonuses!\n\nThe symbols in Bee Hive Bonanza can be divided into those with low value and those with high value. Counting the minimum bet, the former pay between 0.03 € for a combination of 6-7 symbols and up to a maximum of 0.60 € for a combination of 22-24.\n\nWith the high-value symbols, on the other hand, you can earn up to 0.80 € with extended combinations. \n\nThe Money Bee feature is activated when the Bee symbols associated with a 1x, 2x, 5x, or 10x multiplier appear on the reels.\n\nThe Bee symbols can appear associated with other special symbols and activate different functions. Here they are in detail:\n\nBee Hive: the values of all the bees appearing on the reels are added.\n\nMultiplier Bee Hive: doubles all the values of the Bee symbols.\n\nAdder Bee Hive: increases the values of all the Bee symbols.\n\nThe honey cup is our Scatter symbol: with 3, 4, or 5, you can respectively activate 10, 15, and 20 Free Spins. Each additional Scatter that appears during the Bonus round is collected in a meter to the left of the grid. Every few Scatter collected corresponds to a multiplier ranging from x2 to x5. This special function can also be purchased.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nDo the cascade system increases your chances of winning?\n\nYes, because there is the possibility of creating new potential combinations. Some games with this system only offer one Respin, but this is not the case with Bee Hive Bonanza, which continues to replace symbols until winning combos are created.\n\nCan I only play on a computer?\n\nNo, Bee Hive Bonanza offers the possibility to play with any device, smartphone or tablet, without losing in fluidity!\n\nWhere can I find Bee Hive Bonanza?\n\nIn all the major casinos certified by AAMS, the only ones recognized by the Italian State.\n            ",

The game system is cascade, which means that every time we get a winning combination, the paying symbols disappear and are replaced by others. The minimum bet is 0.10 €, the maximum is 3 €. Among the most interesting functions we find Autoplay and the turbo function, which allows us to speed up the rotation of the reels.\n\nTheme and design\n\nBee Hive Bonanza's theme is bees fused with that of the Middle Ages. Bees are dressed as kings or jesters, and the grid is located within a castle. The symbols look like knightly effigies these plus the loveable cartoon version of these insects make for a fun and endearing game. The high-quality graphics immerse players even further.\n\nBonus symbols\n\nThe Bee symbols can appear associated with other special symbols and activate different functions. The Money Bee feature is activated when the Bee symbols associated with a 1x, 2x, 5x, or 10x multiplier appear on the reels. Bee Hive: the values of all the bees appearing on the reels are added. Multiplier Bee Hive: doubles all the values of the Bee symbols. Adder Bee Hive: increases the values of all the Bee symbols.\n\nScatter symbol\n\nThe honey cup is the Scatter symbol in Bee Hive Bonanza. With 3, 4, or 5, you can respectively activate 10, 15, and 20 Free Spins. Each additional Scatter that appears during the Bonus round is collected to a meter to the left of the grid. Every few Scatter collected corresponds to a multiplier ranging from x2 to x5. This special function can also be purchased.\n\nFree spins\n\nYou can activate Free Spins in Bee Hive Bonanza by landing 3, 4, or 5 Scatter symbols. The number of Free Spins you receive depends on how many Scatters you landed. Each additional Scatter that appears during the Bonus round adds to a meter to the left of the grid. Every few Scatter collected corresponds to a multiplier ranging from x2 to x5. This special function can also be purchased.\n\n        \n            ",

With Bee Hive, we are immersed in nature, thanks to a game dedicated to bees. The loveable cartoon version of these insects makes for a very enjoyable and entertaining game. Additionally, the high-quality graphics, as always with NetEnt, make the experience even more immersive!\n\nIn Bee Hive Bonanza, the theme of bees is fused with that of the Middle Ages. Bees are dressed as kings or jesters, the grid is located within a castle, and the symbols look like knightly effigies.\n\nFeatures of Bee Hive Bonanza\n\nThe grid is square in shape with 5 reels and 5 rows, and to win, you need to create combos of at least 6 symbols. The game system is cascade, which means that every time we get a winning combination, the paying symbols disappear and are replaced by others.\n\nThe minimum bet is 0.10 €, the maximum is 3 €. Among the most interesting functions we find Autoplay and the turbo function, which allows us to speed up the rotation of the reels.\n\nA swarm of Bonuses!\n\nThe symbols in Bee Hive Bonanza can be divided into those with low value and those with high value. Counting the minimum bet, the former pay between 0.03 € for a combination of 6-7 symbols and up to a maximum of 0.60 € for a combination of 22-24.\n\nWith the high-value symbols, on the other hand, you can earn up to 0.80 € with extended combinations. \n\nThe Money Bee feature is activated when the Bee symbols associated with a 1x, 2x, 5x, or 10x multiplier appear on the reels.\n\nThe Bee symbols can appear associated with other special symbols and activate different functions. Here they are in detail:\n\nBee Hive: the values of all the bees appearing on the reels are added.\n\nMultiplier Bee Hive: doubles all the values of the Bee symbols.\n\nAdder Bee Hive: increases the values of all the Bee symbols.\n\nThe honey cup is our Scatter symbol: with 3, 4, or 5, you can respectively activate 10, 15, and 20 Free Spins. Each additional Scatter that appears during the Bonus round is collected in a meter to the left of the grid. Every few Scatter collected corresponds to a multiplier ranging from x2 to x5. This special function can also be purchased.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nDo the cascade system increases your chances of winning?\n\nYes, because there is the possibility of creating new potential combinations. Some games with this system only offer one Respin, but this is not the case with Bee Hive Bonanza, which continues to replace symbols until winning combos are created.\n\nCan I only play on a computer?\n\nNo, Bee Hive Bonanza offers the possibility to play with any device, smartphone or tablet, without losing in fluidity!\n\nWhere can I find Bee Hive Bonanza?\n\nIn all the major casinos certified by AAMS, the only ones recognized by the Italian State.\n            ",

With Bee Hive, we are immersed in nature, thanks to a game dedicated to bees. The loveable cartoon version of these insects makes for a very enjoyable and entertaining game. Additionally, the high-quality graphics, as always with NetEnt, make the experience even more immersive!\n\nIn Bee Hive Bonanza, the theme of bees is fused with that of the Middle Ages. Bees are dressed as kings or jesters, the grid is located within a castle, and the symbols look like knightly effigies.\n\nFeatures of Bee Hive Bonanza\n\nThe grid is square in shape with 5 reels and 5 rows, and to win, you need to create combos of at least 6 symbols. The game system is cascade, which means that every time we get a winning combination, the paying symbols disappear and are replaced by others.\n\nThe minimum bet is 0.10 €, the maximum is 3 €. Among the most interesting functions we find Autoplay and the turbo function, which allows us to speed up the rotation of the reels.\n\nA swarm of Bonuses!\n\nThe symbols in Bee Hive Bonanza can be divided into those with low value and those with high value. Counting the minimum bet, the former pay between 0.03 € for a combination of 6-7 symbols and up to a maximum of 0.60 € for a combination of 22-24.\n\nWith the high-value symbols, on the other hand, you can earn up to 0.80 € with extended combinations. \n\nThe Money Bee feature is activated when the Bee symbols associated with a 1x, 2x, 5x, or 10x multiplier appear on the reels.\n\nThe Bee symbols can appear associated with other special symbols and activate different functions. Here they are in detail:\n\nBee Hive: the values of all the bees appearing on the reels are added.\n\nMultiplier Bee Hive: doubles all the values of the Bee symbols.\n\nAdder Bee Hive: increases the values of all the Bee symbols.\n\nThe honey cup is our Scatter symbol: with 3, 4, or 5, you can respectively activate 10, 15, and 20 Free Spins. Each additional Scatter that appears during the Bonus round is collected in a meter to the left of the grid. Every few Scatter collected corresponds to a multiplier ranging from x2 to x5. This special function can also be purchased.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nDo the cascade system increases your chances of winning?\n\nYes, because there is the possibility of creating new potential combinations. Some games with this system only offer one Respin, but this is not the case with Bee Hive Bonanza, which continues to replace symbols until winning combos are created.\n\nCan I only play on a computer?\n\nNo, Bee Hive Bonanza offers the possibility to play with any device, smartphone or tablet, without losing in fluidity!\n\nWhere can I find Bee Hive Bonanza?\n\nIn all the major casinos certified by AAMS, the only ones recognized by the Italian State.\n            ",
