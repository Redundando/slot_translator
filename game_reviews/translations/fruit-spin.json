The game controls include level selection, token value, Autoplay, and betting indicators. The game symbols follow the traditional Fruit Machine style, with low-paying symbols represented by colored fruits and high-paying symbols represented by the number 7 and the BAR icon. The Wild serves as a joker and substitutes for other symbols to create wining combinations, while the Scatter triggers special features. Three Scatters activate free spins, while a 3x3 mini-grid of Scatters activates the Fortune Wheel feature. \n\nGraphics and design\n\nFruit Spin features simple yet captivating graphics set against a blue checkered background and the game logo as the only image. The reels are in a linear frame with realistic symbols that follow the traditional Fruit Machine style. Unfortunately, there are no animations or special effects, which might make the game feel a bit dated.\n\nBetting options and paylines\n\nFruit Spin offers a wide range of bet sizes to accommodate both casual and high roller players. Players can bet 20 tokens on each level with a value ranging from 1 cent to €10, with a maximum bet of €200 per spin. The game features 40 paylines that can be bet on different levels, providing ample opportunities for players to hit the payline and win big.\n\nVolatility and win frequency\n\nWith a medium-low volatility, Fruit Spin offers players the potential for small but constant wins. While players are not likely to hit a huge jackpot, frequent wins in smaller amounts can provide a steady stream of income. This makes Fruit Spin an excellent option for players who prefer a game with smaller, more consistent payouts.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP) percentage\n\nFruit Spin has an excellent return to player (RTP) percentage of 96.84%, which makes it one of the more generous slots available. This high RTP percentage combined with a medium-low volatility means that players have a good chance of hitting frequent wins in smaller amounts. Overall, Fruit Spin is an excellent choice for experienced gamblers who appreciate a well-designed, classic slot game with modern features.\n\n        \n            ",
