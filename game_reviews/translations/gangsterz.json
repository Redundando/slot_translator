While BGaming may not be on the same level as other famous providers, they have already produced memorable titles that are well on their way to becoming online entertainment classics. \n\nGangsterz certainly lived up to our expectations. The screen is well-organized, with the game board taking center stage and three bank structure panels flanking each side. On the left, you can observe your spin winnings, while the right side is dedicated to purchasing bonuses. At the bottom-right, there's a counter that keeps track of the different bonuses we will dive into in greater detail later.\n\nThe graphics are superb, and even without animations, the symbols are well-defined, with the color gold filling the entire screen.\n\nFeatures of Gangsterz\n\nThe square-shaped game board is quite large, with seven reels and seven rows. The gameplay is cluster-based, so it requires forming clusters of identical symbols either horizontally or vertically to win. After each winning combination, symbols are removed and replaced with entirely new ones, potentially leading to additional paying combinations. This mechanism continues until there are no more clusters.\n\nThere's an Autoplay function to spin the reels automatically. You can set it for 10 to 1,000 Spins. You can even choose to let it run indefinitely.\n\nThe RTP value is 96.2%, with high volatility.\n\nFour Fantabulous Bonuses\n\nAs previously mentioned, this slot machine's mechanism is cascading; each cluster generates opportunities for more paying combos. There are no playing cards in Gangsterz; only thematic symbols, with the four dragon eggs paying the least and the dragons paying the most. To win, you need to make clusters of at least five symbols. When you form a square with four adjacent identical symbols, a 2x2 symbol will appear, which increases the value if you win.\n\nOur Wild is a golden \"W\" that substitutes for all other symbols. \n\nTo the right of the game board is a safe with the number 100 on it. After each winning combination, the counter reduces according to the involved symbols. When you reach four levels, bonuses are activated:\n\n25 Symbols Removed: Detonation, turning anywhere from 23 to 6 unpaying symbols into Wilds and removing four symbols.\n\n50 Symbols Removed: Promotion, where a random symbol transforms into another.\n\n75 Symbols Removed: Separation, where a Wild symbol will appear in the center and turn all adjacent symbols into Wilds too.\n\n100 Symbols Removed: Reduction, which removes all low-level symbols.\n\nThere are two more interesting bonuses: Second Chance, which gives you a second spin with a few random Wilds when there aren't any winning combos, and Backlit Symbols, where a random symbol lights up brighter than the others. If combos are formed with it, the winning value will double.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I play Gangsterz on my smartphone?\n\nAbsolutely. The game's architecture makes it available on every device.\n\nCan I try the game before betting real money?\n\nYes, the demo is available on our site for you to test the game without spending a dime.\n\nDoes it have Autoplay?\n\nYes, and you can choose to have it perform 10 to 1,000 Spins.",

When you form a square with four adjacent identical symbols, a 2x2 symbol will appear, which increases the value if you win.\n\nOur Wild is a golden \"W\" that substitutes for all other symbols. \n\nTo the right of the game board is a safe with the number 100 on it. After each winning combination, the counter reduces according to the involved symbols. When you reach four levels, bonuses are activated:\n\n25 Symbols Removed: Detonation, turning anywhere from 23 to 6 unpaying symbols into Wilds and removing four symbols.\n\n50 Symbols Removed: Promotion, where a random symbol transforms into another.\n\n75 Symbols Removed: Separation, where a Wild symbol will appear in the center and turn all adjacent symbols into Wilds too.\n\n100 Symbols Removed: Reduction, which removes all low-level symbols.\n\nThere are two more interesting bonuses: Second Chance, which gives you a second spin with a few random Wilds when there aren't any winning combos, and Backlit Symbols, where a random symbol lights up brighter than the others. If combos are formed with it, the winning value will double.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I play Gangsterz on my smartphone?\n\nAbsolutely. The game's architecture makes it available on every device.\n\nCan I try the game before betting real money?\n\nYes, the demo is available on our site for you to test the game without spending a dime.\n\nDoes it have Autoplay?\n\nYes, and you can choose to have it perform 10 to 1,000 Spins.\n        ",

If combos are formed with it, the winning value will double.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I play Gangsterz on my smartphone?\n\nAbsolutely. The game's architecture makes it available on every device.\n\nCan I try the game before betting real money?\n\nYes, the demo is available on our site for you to test the game without spending a dime.\n\nDoes it have Autoplay?\n\nYes, and you can choose to have it perform 10 to 1,000 Spins.\n            ",

The gameplay is simple: you need to form clusters of identical symbols either horizontally or vertically. After each winning combination, symbols are removed and replaced with new ones, potentially leading to additional paying combinations. There is an Autoplay function that can be set for 10 to 1,000 Spins and runs indefinitely. The RTP value is 96.2%, and it has high volatility.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nGangsterz's graphics are superb, and the symbols are well-defined and colorful. The game's board takes center stage, with three banking structure panels flanking either side. The game's design is well-organized, with the left side showcasing your spin winnings and the right side dedicated to purchasing bonuses. A counter at the bottom-right keeps track of the different bonuses.\n\nBonuses\n\nGangsterz offers four bonuses based on the number of symbols removed. The Detonation bonus turns anywhere from 23 to 6 unpaying symbols into Wilds and removes four symbols. Promotion bonus transforms a random symbol into another. Separation bonus makes a Wild symbol appear in the center and turn adjacent symbols into Wilds too. Finally, Reduction Bonus removes all low-level symbols. There are two more bonuses, the Second Chance, which gives you a second spin with random Wilds when there aren't any winning combos, and Backlit Symbols, where a random symbol lights up brighter than others. If combos are formed with it, the winning value will double.\n\nRTP Value\n\nGangsterz has an RTP value of 96.2%, which is an excellent rate regarding the online slot games industry. The game also has high volatility, which ensures a high payout potential, making it a very attractive slot game.\n\nAccessibility and Demo Version\n\nGangsterz is accessible on every device, and you can even play it on your smartphone.

While BGaming may not be on the same level as other famous providers, they have already produced memorable titles that are well on their way to becoming online entertainment classics. \n\nGangsterz certainly lived up to our expectations. The screen is well-organized, with the game board taking center stage and three bank structure panels flanking each side. On the left, you can observe your spin winnings, while the right side is dedicated to purchasing bonuses. At the bottom-right, there's a counter that keeps track of the different bonuses we will dive into in greater detail later.\n\nThe graphics are superb, and even without animations, the symbols are well-defined, with the color gold filling the entire screen.\n\nFeatures of Gangsterz\n\nThe square-shaped game board is quite large, with seven reels and seven rows. The gameplay is cluster-based, so it requires forming clusters of identical symbols either horizontally or vertically to win. After each winning combination, symbols are removed and replaced with entirely new ones, potentially leading to additional paying combinations. This mechanism continues until there are no more clusters.\n\nThere's an Autoplay function to spin the reels automatically. You can set it for 10 to 1,000 Spins. You can even choose to let it run indefinitely.\n\nThe RTP value is 96.2%, with high volatility.\n\nFour Fantabulous Bonuses\n\nAs previously mentioned, this slot machine's mechanism is cascading; each cluster generates opportunities for more paying combos. There are no playing cards in Gangsterz; only thematic symbols, with the four dragon eggs paying the least and the dragons paying the most. To win, you need to make clusters of at least five symbols. When you form a square with four adjacent identical symbols, a 2x2 symbol will appear, which increases the value if you win.\n\nOur Wild is a golden \"W\" that substitutes for all other symbols. \n\nTo the right of the game board is a safe with the number 100 on it. After each winning combination, the counter reduces according to the involved symbols. When you reach four levels, bonuses are activated:\n\n25 Symbols Removed: Detonation, turning anywhere from 23 to 6 unpaying symbols into Wilds and removing four symbols.\n\n50 Symbols Removed: Promotion, where a random symbol transforms into another.\n\n75 Symbols Removed: Separation, where a Wild symbol will appear in the center and turn all adjacent symbols into Wilds too.\n\n100 Symbols Removed: Reduction, which removes all low-level symbols.\n\nThere are two more interesting bonuses: Second Chance, which gives you a second spin with a few random Wilds when there aren't any winning combos, and Backlit Symbols, where a random symbol lights up brighter than the others. If combos are formed with it, the winning value will double.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I play Gangsterz on my smartphone?\n\nAbsolutely. The game's architecture makes it available on every device.\n\nCan I try the game before betting real money?\n\nYes, the demo is available on our site for you to test the game without spending a dime.\n\nDoes it have Autoplay?\n\nYes, and you can choose to have it perform 10 to 1,000 Spins.\n            ",

While BGaming may not be on the same level as other famous providers, they have already produced memorable titles that are well on their way to becoming online entertainment classics. \n\nGangsterz certainly lived up to our expectations. The screen is well-organized, with the game board taking center stage and three bank structure panels flanking each side. On the left, you can observe your spin winnings, while the right side is dedicated to purchasing bonuses. At the bottom-right, there's a counter that keeps track of the different bonuses we will dive into in greater detail later.\n\nThe graphics are superb, and even without animations, the symbols are well-defined, with the color gold filling the entire screen.\n\nFeatures of Gangsterz\n\nThe square-shaped game board is quite large, with seven reels and seven rows. The gameplay is cluster-based, so it requires forming clusters of identical symbols either horizontally or vertically to win. After each winning combination, symbols are removed and replaced with entirely new ones, potentially leading to additional paying combinations. This mechanism continues until there are no more clusters.\n\nThere's an Autoplay function to spin the reels automatically. You can set it for 10 to 1,000 Spins. You can even choose to let it run indefinitely.\n\nThe RTP value is 96.2%, with high volatility.\n\nFour Fantabulous Bonuses\n\nAs previously mentioned, this slot machine's mechanism is cascading; each cluster generates opportunities for more paying combos. There are no playing cards in Gangsterz; only thematic symbols, with the four dragon eggs paying the least and the dragons paying the most. To win, you need to make clusters of at least five symbols. When you form a square with four adjacent identical symbols, a 2x2 symbol will appear, which increases the value if you win.\n\nOur Wild is a golden \"W\" that substitutes for all other symbols. \n\nTo the right of the game board is a safe with the number 100 on it. After each winning combination, the counter reduces according to the involved symbols. When you reach four levels, bonuses are activated:\n\n25 Symbols Removed: Detonation, turning anywhere from 23 to 6 unpaying symbols into Wilds and removing four symbols.\n\n50 Symbols Removed: Promotion, where a random symbol transforms into another.\n\n75 Symbols Removed: Separation, where a Wild symbol will appear in the center and turn all adjacent symbols into Wilds too.\n\n100 Symbols Removed: Reduction, which removes all low-level symbols.\n\nThere are two more interesting bonuses: Second Chance, which gives you a second spin with a few random Wilds when there aren't any winning combos, and Backlit Symbols, where a random symbol lights up brighter than the others. If combos are formed with it, the winning value will double.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I play Gangsterz on my smartphone?\n\nAbsolutely. The game's architecture makes it available on every device.\n\nCan I try the game before betting real money?\n\nYes, the demo is available on our site for you to test the game without spending a dime.\n\nDoes it have Autoplay?\n\nYes, and you can choose to have it perform 10 to 1,000 Spins.\n            ",
