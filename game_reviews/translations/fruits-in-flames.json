Fruits in Flames is just one of the many fruit-themed slots that crowd the online gaming scene. The legitimate question we could ask ourselves is why choose to try it out. Well, the reasons are diverse, starting with the extreme simplicity of the gameplay: here you won't find any special features that activate upon reaching certain milestones, nor special symbols, no Wilds, and no Scatters. In some ways, we can say that Fruits in Flames is a hymn to the purest translation of slot machines. A second reason to choose it is certainly the careful graphics, but if you know other Bally products, it will be even more superfluous to write it. The black color that characterizes the game grid highlights the bright color of the symbols, a contrast made even more evident by the flames in the background. On the sides of the frame we find the pay lines and in the lower part the information that summarizes our bet. There are then the buttons to make the maximum bet all at once, for Autoplay and Start.\nSlot Characteristics\nYou play on 10 fixed pay lines arranged on a traditionally cut grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The base bet is 10 coins that can be raised up to a maximum of 10,000, also through the Max Bet button. You win when the same symbols appear in a sequence from left to right on a pay line, in case of more combinations on different lines, the winnings are added. It is not possible to activate a predefined number of automatic spins and it is possible to stop them at any time by clicking on the Stop button.\nFruits in Flames has an RTP of 96.17%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nOne of the great advantages of Fruits in Flames is the offer of high-level winnings. In the examples that follow, we will take into account the minimum bet of €10 to illustrate the amounts that could be won. The symbols of cherries, lemon, orange, and plum are the least valuable, if they appear for 3 times, you win €20, and with 5 a whopping €200! Next, we find the watermelon and the bells, and even in this case, the figures are not trivial. £ symbols will earn us €50, with 5 we are entitled to a win of €500! The 7 is the symbol with the highest value of all: 3 will give us €100, 5 the enviable figure of €5,000!\nFruits in Flames introduces the Gamble feature to try to double the winnings. Following a winning combination, three buttons will appear on the screen: Collect, Card Gamble, and Ladder Gamble. In the first case, we will collect the winnings and continue the normal game. If we choose Card Gamble, we will be faced with a deck of cards, and we have to choose what color the next card will be. In the case of Ladder Gamble instead, we will be faced with a series of increasing amounts arranged vertically. Our task will be to try to select the highest figure above the starting point, avoiding clicking on the lower one.\n            ",

Fruits in Flames is just one of the many fruit-themed slots that crowd the online gaming scene. The legitimate question we could ask ourselves is why choose to try it out. Well, the reasons are diverse, starting with the extreme simplicity of the gameplay: here you won't find any special features that activate upon reaching certain milestones, nor special symbols, no Wilds, and no Scatters. In some ways, we can say that Fruits in Flames is a hymn to the purest translation of slot machines. A second reason to choose it is certainly the careful graphics, but if you know other Bally products, it will be even more superfluous to write it. The black color that characterizes the game grid highlights the bright color of the symbols, a contrast made even more evident by the flames in the background. On the sides of the frame we find the pay lines and in the lower part the information that summarizes our bet. There are then the buttons to make the maximum bet all at once, for Autoplay and Start.\nSlot Characteristics\nYou play on 10 fixed pay lines arranged on a traditionally cut grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The base bet is 10 coins that can be raised up to a maximum of 10,000, also through the Max Bet button. You win when the same symbols appear in a sequence from left to right on a pay line, in case of more combinations on different lines, the winnings are added. It is not possible to activate a predefined number of automatic spins and it is possible to stop them at any time by clicking on the Stop button.\nFruits in Flames has an RTP of 96.17%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nOne of the great advantages of Fruits in Flames is the offer of high-level winnings. In the examples that follow, we will take into account the minimum bet of €10 to illustrate the amounts that could be won. The symbols of cherries, lemon, orange, and plum are the least valuable, if they appear for 3 times, you win €20, and with 5 a whopping €200! Next, we find the watermelon and the bells, and even in this case, the figures are not trivial. £ symbols will earn us €50, with 5 we are entitled to a win of €500! The 7 is the symbol with the highest value of all: 3 will give us €100, 5 the enviable figure of €5,000!\nFruits in Flames introduces the Gamble feature to try to double the winnings. Following a winning combination, three buttons will appear on the screen: Collect, Card Gamble, and Ladder Gamble. In the first case, we will collect the winnings and continue the normal game. If we choose Card Gamble, we will be faced with a deck of cards, and we have to choose what color the next card will be. In the case of Ladder Gamble instead, we will be faced with a series of increasing amounts arranged vertically. Our task will be to try to select the highest figure above the starting point, avoiding clicking on the lower one.\n            ",
