Players can bet five total credits, with the cost of each credit set at €0.01. The game features high volatility and a normal theoretical return to the player which is equal to 95.01%.\n\nRespin function and its conditions\n\nMaximator has a Respins function. The feature is activated when two identical stacked symbols are on the reels but do not generate a win. The third reel spins independently with a Respin, providing the opportunity to get one or more wins.\n\nMultiplier wheel feature\n\nThe slot game activates a special function when a single symbol lands on all the reels to cover the entire grid. In this case, a large wheel of fortune divided into segments with a multiplier to apply to the win will appear on the screen. Only one segment differs, destined for the Maxi Prize instead.\n\nGamble function\n\nMaximator has a Gamble function. This feature becomes available after every win. By clicking on the Risk button, a deck of covered cards will be shown, and players will have to try to guess the color of the drawn card. If the choice turns out to be correct, players will get another chance to increase their win. If unsuccessful, they will lose everything.\n\nGame's volatility and theoretical return to player\n\nMaximator has high volatility, and the theoretical return to the player is 95.01%.\n\n        \n            ",

Developed by Swintt, this game has a vintage vibe with vibrant colors and classic sound effects that replicate those of land-based slots. The game grid is basic, with three reels and three rows, and just 5 fixed pay lines on which you can bet 5 total credits. Its features include Respins, a multiplier wheel, and a Gamble function.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nTo win in Maximator, players must form combos of adjacent identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. Autoplay allows players to set a variable number of automatic spins, including some limits on spending, winning, or losing. The game also has a high volatility and a 95.01% theoretical return to the player. Its features include the Respins function, which occurs when two identical stacked symbols land on two reels but do not generate a win, and a Gamble function that offers players a 50% chance of guessing and doubling their win.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nMaximator has several symbols that have different pay values. The x, cherries, and lemon are the low-value symbols. The orange, plums, bar sign, bell, and number seven have higher pay values. The fox is the Wild symbol and can replace all symbols and pays. There are just 5 fixed pay lines on this game, on which players can bet 5 total credits, with the cost of each credit set at €0.01. The paylines pay from left to right.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nMaximator has a high volatility and a 95.01% theoretical return to the player. Volatility refers to the risk involved in playing the game. Games with high volatility have a higher risk but also offer greater rewards. The theoretical return to the player is the ratio of how much money the game will pay out in winnings compared to the amount bet.\n\nWhere to Play and Try Maximator\n\nMaximator is available in all AAMS certified online casinos, ensuring the legality of the casino. Players can also try the game without investing real money through the DEMO or Play for Fun version available on all platforms dedicated to slot games.\n\n        \n            ",

Swintt seems to appeal to nostalgic players, although we are sure that trying Maximator, even those accustomed to more modern slots will not be able to stop playing it.\n\nWith an essential style, vibrant colors, and large symbols with excellent definition, we are faced with a product that will warm your heart, also thanks to the sounds that replicate those of land-based slots, for a vintage gaming experience! \n\nAll essential features in a small grid\n\nThe game grid is very basic, with three reels and three rows and just 5 fixed pay lines on which you can bet 5 total credits, with the cost of each credit set at €0.01. To win, it is necessary to form combos of adjacent identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. Autoplay allows you to set a variable number of automatic spins, including some limits on spending, winning, or losing, beyond which this game mode will be interrupted.\n\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to the player is normal, being equal to 95.01%.\n\nSymbols, respins, and mega win\n\nNow let's look at the symbols of Maximator starting from the lowest. Paying the least of all is the x, followed by the cherries and the lemon, then there is the orange, the plums, the bar sign, the bell, and the number seven. The fox is our Wild and, in addition to replacing all symbols, it pays.\n\nMaximator has some special features. First of all, the Respins function: when two identical stacked symbols land on two reels, but do not generate a win, then the third reel will spin independently with a Respin, giving the possibility of obtaining one or more wins.\n\nAnother special function is activated when a single symbol lands on all the reels to cover the entire grid. In this case, a large wheel of fortune divided into segments with a multiplier to apply to the win will appear on the screen. Only one segment differs, destined for the Maxi Prize instead.\n\nMaximator has a Gamble function. In practice, after every win, you can decide to try to double the win. By clicking on the Risk button, a deck of covered cards will be shown, and you will have to try to guess the color of the drawn card. If the choice turns out to be correct, we will have another chance to increase the win, in case of error, we will lose everything.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nI read that the Gamble function is in the game. Is it advisable to take advantage of it?\n\nIt depends on how daring you are! The Gamble function offers a 50% chance of guessing and therefore doubling the win; on the other hand, in case of defeat, the entire sum is lost!\n\nWhere can I play Maximator?\n\nIn all AAMS certified online casinos, guaranteeing the legality of the casino.\n\nCan I try the game before investing real money?\n\nCertainly, in all platforms dedicated to slots, it is possible to test the game through the DEMO or Play for Fun version.\n        ",
