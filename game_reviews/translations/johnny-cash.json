Produced by the software house BGaming, Johnny Cash has nothing to do with the extraordinary namesake artist, but it is a fun and well-made game where the protagonist is a very cute cactus-cowboy!\n\nThe initial screen welcomes us with the image of the cactus, raising two guns and peeping out from the \"Johnny Cash\" label. Behind the cactus, we find a typical wild west landscape where the desert and rugged nature frame coins and bags full of money. We have the same background on the game screen as well.\n\nFrom a graphical point of view, Johnny Cash will not amaze you, but the quick gameplay and fun style will make the gaming experience equally enjoyable.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nJohnny Cash is a slot that features five reels and twenty pay lines, and gives you the chance to win prizes up to 1,000 times the value of your bet. The betting options range from a minimum of 0.20 up to a maximum of €50 for each spin. You win every time you get a combination of matching symbols on adjacent reels starting from the leftmost one.\n\nIt is a game characterized by medium volatility, so you will find a balance between winning frequency and prize value. As for the theoretical return to player (RTP), we must say that Johnny Cash is not among the best slots: with only 93.9%, it is quite disappointing from this point of view.\n\nSymbols and special features of Johnny Cash\nJohnny Cash is not a particularly elaborate slot machine in terms of gameplay or choice of symbols. On the reels, we have usual playing cards and some thematic symbols, including a bottle of tequila, a cowboy hat, a bag of money, a cactus outlaw icon, a dynamite stick, and a sheriff badge.\n\nThe sheriff's badge represents the Wild of the game and replaces all symbols except the Scatter to complete a winning combination. The Scatter is instead represented by the dynamite stick, which, if it appears three, four, or five times on the reels, not only awards a variable number of bonus spins but also a 2x, 10x, or 100x multiplier.\n\nAfter any win, there is then the possibility to further challenge luck thanks to the Gamble feature, which allows you to bet on the color and suit of a card turned over that will appear on the screen.

This five-reel, twenty-pay line slot game offers betting options ranging from 0.20 to €50 per spin. Winning combos can be achieved by landing matching symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost one. With medium volatility, you'll get a perfect balance between win frequency and payout value. Just keep in mind to not get too excited, as the Return to Player rate is pretty low at 93.9%. It's like playing Russian roulette, but with better odds. </p>'}"

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics and rules\n\nJohnny Cash is a five-reel, twenty-pay line slot game with betting options ranging from 0.20 to €50 per spin. Winning combinations are achieved by landing matching symbols on adjacent reels from the leftmost reel. The game has medium volatility, striking an excellent balance between win frequency and payout value. However, it has a low Return to Player (RTP) rate of 93.9%.\n\nSymbols and their values\n\nJohnny Cash features a selection of themed symbols, including a bottle of tequila, a cowboy hat, a bag of money, a cactus outlaw icon, a dynamite stick, and a sheriff badge. Additionally, it features traditional playing card symbols. The Sheriff's badge is the Wild symbol, substituting all others, apart from the Scatter, to increase winning potential. The Scatter, represented by the dynamite stick, triggers bonus spins and a multiplier of either 2x, 10x, or 100x when it appears three or more times on the reels.\n\nBonus features and special symbols\n\nJohnny Cash has a Scatter symbol, the dynamite stick, which, when three or more appear on the reels, can award bonus spins and a multiplier. The game also features a Wild symbol, represented by a Sheriff's badge, that replaces all other symbols to complete winning combinations. After any win, players can choose to gamble their winnings by selecting the Gamble feature. Here, players must guess the color or suit of a card to double or quadruple their winnings. Note that any incorrect guesses result in losing the gamble amount.\n\nVolatility and potential payouts\n\nJohnny Cash is a medium volatility slot game, which means that the frequency of wins and the payout value are well-balanced. The game offers a maximum payout of 1,000 times the bet amount. Betting options range from 0.20 to €50, with plenty of opportunities to increase winning potential thanks to the Wild and Scatter symbols and the Gamble feature.\n\nOverall theme and presentation\n\nJohnny Cash has a fun and well-made gameplay style despite lacking any links to the renowned artist of the same name. The game's theme centers on a cactus-cowboy, and the backdrop features a wild west landscape filled with coins and money bags. The graphics are not cutting edge, but the gameplay is fun and straightforward, making the game enjoyable to play.\n\n        \n            ",
