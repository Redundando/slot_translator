            "response": "Action Bank Plus\nThe simple yet classy design and straightforward gameplay come together in Action Bank Plus, a 6-reel, 4,096 ways to win game from Barcrest and Red 7. The basic gameplay is fairly elementary, but triggering the round for free spins with double symbols on reel 1 and wilds on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5. The stake in this high variance game ranges from €0.10 to €200 per spin.\nSimplistic Graphics\nThe colorful symbols on the reels of the Action Bank Plus slot machine stand out against a gray background. A metal frame surrounds the main game, but overall it's an unusually simple design. \nPlay the Action Bank Plus slot and you'll see that the styling extends to the symbols. The main symbols are white crosses on a bright red background, the red 7 against blue and the black BAR on white.\nMost slots manage to pack their reels with ten or more symbols, but as our review of Action Bank Plus will show, it only takes three to get a lot of winning combinations.\nOnly three symbols filling the 24 positions on the reels would lead to more wins on every spin. Although it would be nice, in the real world this won't happen. You'll find many positions occupied by bold white 'O' symbols on black backgrounds. These are blank spaces, but as we examine the Action Bank Plus slot, we'll show you how they still have their benefits.\nAlthough the Action Bank Plus slot was developed by the Red7 studio, it is marketed as a Scientific Games version. In some countries, the Barcrest name is used in advertising. It all depends on Scientific Games and its subsidiaries' complex ownership structure.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nIf you land 4 O symbols in all 4 positions on reel 6, the vault function is activated. The O turns into bank vaults. Choose one of them. Each vault contains 4, 8, 12 or 16 free spins. An extra free spin is added to the Vault total for every O symbol that was on the reels at the time the spin was activated. You can trigger another free spin by landing a quartet of O symbols on reel 6. You will then get another picking session.\nThere are a couple of extras in the game during free spins that aren't available in the base game. A wild only appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. This wild symbol replaces all standard symbols. During free spins, special double symbols will appear on reel 1. These count as 2 symbols and can give an extra boost to your winning chances.\nThe basic gameplay in Action Bank Plus is very straightforward. The game can come to life when the vault is unlocked and free spins with double symbols and wilds come into play. Again, there is not a great variety on offer. What Action Bank Plus offers is volatile gameplay.\nIf you're lucky, you can win a huge payout of 12,960 x on each tailspin.\nThere's a bit more during the feature than in the base game, starting with the double symbols that can appear on reel 1. These count as 2 symbols and can get your winning combinations started immediately. There are also wild symbols in play. These can appear anywhere but reels 1 and 6, and replace the 3 paying symbols. You can reactivate the Vault function by landing 4 O symbols on reel 6. You will then get another pick and more free spins.\nThe action in Action Bank Plus takes place on a 6-reel, 4-row machine that combines to offer 4,096 ways to win. On the reels, you'll see a lot of O symbols. These are blank and don't offer any winnings. However, they can be useful for triggering the bonus round, more on that shortly.\nThere are only 3 paying symbols in fact. The X, the Bar, and the Lucky Red 7. Land 3, 4, 5, or 6 of these on adjacent reels and you'll score a prize equal to 0.25, 1, 2.5, or 10 times your total bet.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIt may be a bit too simple for some, but if you want a fresh perspective on an old-school theme, Action Bank Plus offers just that. If you like volatile slots, try Barcrest's Rainbow Riches Megaways, which combines high variance mechanics with a classic slot brand. If you like 6-reel, 4,096 ways to win slots, we can definitely recommend the classic WMS slot Raging Rhino.",

Landing 3, 4, 5, or 6 of these symbols on adjacent reels will earn you a prize of 0.25, 1, 2.5, or 10 times your total bet.\n\nIf you're looking for a new perspective on an old-school theme, Action Bank Plus offers just that. For more volatile slots, try Barcrest's Rainbow Riches Megaways, which combines high variance mechanics with classic slot motifs. And if you enjoy 6-reel, 4096 ways to win slots, we highly recommend WMS's classic Raging Rhino slot."

The basic gameplay is fairly elementary, but triggering the round for free spins with double symbols on reel 1 and wilds on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5. The stake in this high variance game ranges from €0.10 to €200 per spin.\nSimplistic Graphics\nThe colorful symbols on the reels of the Action Bank Plus slot machine stand out against a gray background. A metal frame surrounds the main game, but overall it's an unusually simple design. \nPlay the Action Bank Plus slot and you'll see that the styling extends to the symbols. The main symbols are white crosses on a bright red background, the red 7 against blue and the black BAR on white.\nMost slots manage to pack their reels with ten or more symbols, but as our review of Action Bank Plus will show, it only takes three to get a lot of winning combinations.\nOnly three symbols filling the 24 positions on the reels would lead to more wins on every spin. Although it would be nice, in the real world this won't happen. You'll find many positions occupied by bold white 'O' symbols on black backgrounds. These are blank spaces, but as we examine the Action Bank Plus slot, we'll show you how they still have their benefits.\nAlthough the Action Bank Plus slot was developed by the Red7 studio, it is marketed as a Scientific Games version. In some countries, the Barcrest name is used in advertising. It all depends on Scientific Games and its subsidiaries' complex ownership structure.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nIf you land 4 O symbols in all 4 positions on reel 6, the vault function is activated. The O turns into bank vaults. Choose one of them. Each vault contains 4, 8, 12 or 16 free spins. An extra free spin is added to the Vault total for every O symbol that was on the reels at the time the spin was activated. You can trigger another free spin by landing a quartet of O symbols on reel 6. You will then get another picking session.\nThere are a couple of extras in the game during free spins that aren't available in the base game. A wild only appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. This wild symbol replaces all standard symbols. During free spins, special double symbols will appear on reel 1. These count as 2 symbols and can give an extra boost to your winning chances.\nThe basic gameplay in Action Bank Plus is very straightforward. The game can come to life when the vault is unlocked and free spins with double symbols and wilds come into play. Again, there is not a great variety on offer. What Action Bank Plus offers is volatile gameplay.\nIf you're lucky, you can win a huge payout of 12,960 x on each tailspin.\nThere's a bit more during the feature than in the base game, starting with the double symbols that can appear on reel 1. These count as 2 symbols and can get your winning combinations started immediately. There are also wild symbols in play. These can appear anywhere but reels 1 and 6, and replace the 3 paying symbols. You can reactivate the Vault function by landing 4 O symbols on reel 6. You will then get another pick and more free spins.\nThe action in Action Bank Plus takes place on a 6-reel, 4-row machine that combines to offer 4,096 ways to win.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay\nFree spins\nVault function\nSymbols\nStakes\nPayouts\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Action Bank Plus\nThe simple yet classy design and straightforward gameplay come together in Action Bank Plus, a 6-reel, 4,096 ways to win game from Barcrest and Red 7. The basic gameplay is fairly elementary, but triggering the round for free spins with double symbols on reel 1 and wilds on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5. The stake in this high variance game ranges from €0.10 to €200 per spin.\nSimplistic Graphics\nThe colorful symbols on the reels of the Action Bank Plus slot machine stand out against a gray background. A metal frame surrounds the main game, but overall it's an unusually simple design. \nPlay the Action Bank Plus slot and you'll see that the styling extends to the symbols. The main symbols are white crosses on a bright red background, the red 7 against blue and the black BAR on white.\nMost slots manage to pack their reels with ten or more symbols, but as our review of Action Bank Plus will show, it only takes three to get a lot of winning combinations.\nOnly three symbols filling the 24 positions on the reels would lead to more wins on every spin. Although it would be nice, in the real world this won't happen. You'll find many positions occupied by bold white 'O' symbols on black backgrounds. These are blank spaces, but as we examine the Action Bank Plus slot, we'll show you how they still have their benefits.\nAlthough the Action Bank Plus slot was developed by the Red7 studio, it is marketed as a Scientific Games version. In some countries, the Barcrest name is used in advertising. It all depends on Scientific Games and its subsidiaries' complex ownership structure.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nIf you land 4 O symbols in all 4 positions on reel 6, the vault function is activated. The O turns into bank vaults. Choose one of them. Each vault contains 4, 8, 12 or 16 free spins. An extra free spin is added to the Vault total for every O symbol that was on the reels at the time the spin was activated. You can trigger another free spin by landing a quartet of O symbols on reel 6. You will then get another picking session.\nThere are a couple of extras in the game during free spins that aren't available in the base game. A wild only appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. This wild symbol replaces all standard symbols. During free spins, special double symbols will appear on reel 1. These count as 2 symbols and can give an extra boost to your winning chances.\nThe basic gameplay in Action Bank Plus is very straightforward. The game can come to life when the vault is unlocked and free spins with double symbols and wilds come into play. Again, there is not a great variety on offer. What Action Bank Plus offers is volatile gameplay.\nIf you're lucky, you can win a huge payout of 12,960 x on each tailspin.\nThere's a bit more during the feature than in the base game, starting with the double symbols that can appear on reel 1. These count as 2 symbols and can get your winning combinations started immediately. There are also wild symbols in play. These can appear anywhere but reels 1 and 6, and replace the 3 paying symbols. You can reactivate the Vault function by landing 4 O symbols on reel 6. You will then get another pick and more free spins.\nThe action in Action Bank Plus takes place on a 6-reel, 4-row machine that combines to offer 4,096 ways to win. On the reels, you'll see a lot of O symbols. These are blank and don't offer any winnings. However, they can be useful for triggering the bonus round, more on that shortly.\nThere are only 3 paying symbols in fact. The X, the Bar, and the Lucky Red 7. Land 3, 4, 5, or 6 of these on adjacent reels and you'll score a prize equal to 0.25, 1, 2.5, or 10 times your total bet.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIt may be a bit too simple for some, but if you want a fresh perspective on an old-school theme, Action Bank Plus offers just that. If you like volatile slots, try Barcrest's Rainbow Riches Megaways, which combines high variance mechanics with a classic slot brand. If you like 6-reel, 4,096 ways to win slots, we can definitely recommend the classic WMS slot Raging Rhino.\n            ",

And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, each O symbol on the reels at the time the spin was activated adds another free spin to the bonus round!</p>\n\n<p>The free spins round in Action Bank Plus is re-triggerable, meaning that even more chances to win could be just around the corner. So, what are you waiting for? Spin those reels, trigger that free spins round and maybe even unlock the Vault function. Who knows, you could be the next big winner!</p>\"}"

Each vault contains 4, 8, 12, or 16 free spins, and an extra free spin is added for every O symbol on the reels at the time the spin was activated. The free spins round is also re-triggerable.\n\nVault function\n\nThe Vault function in Action Bank Plus is activated by landing 4 O symbols on reel 6. Each O symbol turns into a bank vault, and the player must pick one of the vaults to reveal how many free spins they have won. The Vault function can be reactivated by landing 4 O symbols on reel 6 during the free spins round.\n\nSymbols and payouts\n\nAction Bank Plus has 3 paying symbols: X, Bar, and Lucky Red 7. Landing 3, 4, 5, or 6 of these symbols on adjacent reels will award a prize equal to 0.25, 1, 2.5, or 10 times the player's total bet. Blank O symbols occupy many positions on the reels, but they can be useful for triggering the Vault function. During free spins, double symbols appear on reel 1, which count as 2 symbols and can increase the chances of winning combinations. Wild symbols only appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, and replace all standard symbols.\n\nVolatility\n\nAction Bank Plus is a high variance slot game, which means that it offers the potential for large payouts but also comes with a higher level of risk. The game has a maximum payout of 12,960x the player's total bet, but winnings may be infrequent due to the game's volatility.\n\nComparison to similar slots\n\nAction Bank Plus may be too simple for some players, but it offers a fresh take on an old-school slot theme. For players who prefer high variance mechanics with classic slot brands, Barcrest's Rainbow Riches Megaways is a good option. For players who enjoy 6-reel, 4,096 ways to win slots, the classic WMS slot Raging Rhino is highly recommended.\n\n        \n            ",

The basic gameplay is fairly elementary, but triggering the round for free spins with double symbols on reel 1 and wilds on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5. The stake in this high variance game ranges from €0.10 to €200 per spin.\nSimplistic Graphics\nThe colorful symbols on the reels of the Action Bank Plus slot machine stand out against a gray background. A metal frame surrounds the main game, but overall it's an unusually simple design. \nPlay the Action Bank Plus slot and you'll see that the styling extends to the symbols. The main symbols are white crosses on a bright red background, the red 7 against blue and the black BAR on white.\nMost slots manage to pack their reels with ten or more symbols, but as our review of Action Bank Plus will show, it only takes three to get a lot of winning combinations.\nOnly three symbols filling the 24 positions on the reels would lead to more wins on every spin. Although it would be nice, in the real world this won't happen. You'll find many positions occupied by bold white 'O' symbols on black backgrounds. These are blank spaces, but as we examine the Action Bank Plus slot, we'll show you how they still have their benefits.\nAlthough the Action Bank Plus slot was developed by the Red7 studio, it is marketed as a Scientific Games version. In some countries, the Barcrest name is used in advertising. It all depends on Scientific Games and its subsidiaries' complex ownership structure.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nIf you land 4 O symbols in all 4 positions on reel 6, the vault function is activated. The O turns into bank vaults. Choose one of them. Each vault contains 4, 8, 12 or 16 free spins. An extra free spin is added to the Vault total for every O symbol that was on the reels at the time the spin was activated. You can trigger another free spin by landing a quartet of O symbols on reel 6. You will then get another picking session.\nThere are a couple of extras in the game during free spins that aren't available in the base game. A wild only appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. This wild symbol replaces all standard symbols. During free spins, special double symbols will appear on reel 1. These count as 2 symbols and can give an extra boost to your winning chances.\nThe basic gameplay in Action Bank Plus is very straightforward. The game can come to life when the vault is unlocked and free spins with double symbols and wilds come into play. Again, there is not a great variety on offer. What Action Bank Plus offers is volatile gameplay.\nIf you're lucky, you can win a huge payout of 12,960 x on each tailspin.\nThere's a bit more during the feature than in the base game, starting with the double symbols that can appear on reel 1. These count as 2 symbols and can get your winning combinations started immediately. There are also wild symbols in play. These can appear anywhere but reels 1 and 6, and replace the 3 paying symbols. You can reactivate the Vault function by landing 4 O symbols on reel 6. You will then get another pick and more free spins.\nThe action in Action Bank Plus takes place on a 6-reel, 4-row machine that combines to offer 4,096 ways to win. On the reels, you'll see a lot of O symbols. These are blank and don't offer any winnings. However, they can be useful for triggering the bonus round, more on that shortly.\nThere are only 3 paying symbols in fact. The X, the Bar, and the Lucky Red 7. Land 3, 4, 5, or 6 of these on adjacent reels and you'll score a prize equal to 0.25, 1, 2.5, or 10 times your total bet.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIt may be a bit too simple for some, but if you want a fresh perspective on an old-school theme, Action Bank Plus offers just that. If you like volatile slots, try Barcrest's Rainbow Riches Megaways, which combines high variance mechanics with a classic slot brand. If you like 6-reel, 4,096 ways to win slots, we can definitely recommend the classic WMS slot Raging Rhino.\n            ",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a review of the game \"Action Bank Plus\".\n\nPlease provide an FAQ:\n\n- 8 questions\n- Use simple language and provide practical takeaways.\n- Respond with a JSON!\n- Use the key \"faq\" and an array with the keys \"question\" and \"answer\". \n\nReview: Action Bank Plus\nThe simple yet classy design and straightforward gameplay come together in Action Bank Plus, a 6-reel, 4,096 ways to win game from Barcrest and Red 7. The basic gameplay is fairly elementary, but triggering the round for free spins with double symbols on reel 1 and wilds on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5. The stake in this high variance game ranges from €0.10 to €200 per spin.\nSimplistic Graphics\nThe colorful symbols on the reels of the Action Bank Plus slot machine stand out against a gray background. A metal frame surrounds the main game, but overall it's an unusually simple design. \nPlay the Action Bank Plus slot and you'll see that the styling extends to the symbols. The main symbols are white crosses on a bright red background, the red 7 against blue and the black BAR on white.\nMost slots manage to pack their reels with ten or more symbols, but as our review of Action Bank Plus will show, it only takes three to get a lot of winning combinations.\nOnly three symbols filling the 24 positions on the reels would lead to more wins on every spin. Although it would be nice, in the real world this won't happen. You'll find many positions occupied by bold white 'O' symbols on black backgrounds. These are blank spaces, but as we examine the Action Bank Plus slot, we'll show you how they still have their benefits.\nAlthough the Action Bank Plus slot was developed by the Red7 studio, it is marketed as a Scientific Games version. In some countries, the Barcrest name is used in advertising. It all depends on Scientific Games and its subsidiaries' complex ownership structure.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nIf you land 4 O symbols in all 4 positions on reel 6, the vault function is activated. The O turns into bank vaults. Choose one of them. Each vault contains 4, 8, 12 or 16 free spins. An extra free spin is added to the Vault total for every O symbol that was on the reels at the time the spin was activated. You can trigger another free spin by landing a quartet of O symbols on reel 6. You will then get another picking session.\nThere are a couple of extras in the game during free spins that aren't available in the base game. A wild only appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. This wild symbol replaces all standard symbols. During free spins, special double symbols will appear on reel 1. These count as 2 symbols and can give an extra boost to your winning chances.\nThe basic gameplay in Action Bank Plus is very straightforward. The game can come to life when the vault is unlocked and free spins with double symbols and wilds come into play. Again, there is not a great variety on offer. What Action Bank Plus offers is volatile gameplay.\nIf you're lucky, you can win a huge payout of 12,960 x on each tailspin.\nThere's a bit more during the feature than in the base game, starting with the double symbols that can appear on reel 1. These count as 2 symbols and can get your winning combinations started immediately. There are also wild symbols in play. These can appear anywhere but reels 1 and 6, and replace the 3 paying symbols. You can reactivate the Vault function by landing 4 O symbols on reel 6. You will then get another pick and more free spins.\nThe action in Action Bank Plus takes place on a 6-reel, 4-row machine that combines to offer 4,096 ways to win. On the reels, you'll see a lot of O symbols. These are blank and don't offer any winnings. However, they can be useful for triggering the bonus round, more on that shortly.\nThere are only 3 paying symbols in fact. The X, the Bar, and the Lucky Red 7. Land 3, 4, 5, or 6 of these on adjacent reels and you'll score a prize equal to 0.25, 1, 2.5, or 10 times your total bet.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIt may be a bit too simple for some, but if you want a fresh perspective on an old-school theme, Action Bank Plus offers just that. If you like volatile slots, try Barcrest's Rainbow Riches Megaways, which combines high variance mechanics with a classic slot brand. If you like 6-reel, 4,096 ways to win slots, we can definitely recommend the classic WMS slot Raging Rhino.\n            ",
