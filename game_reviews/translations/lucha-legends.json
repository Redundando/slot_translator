Any wild landing will trigger the Super Wild feature, leading to even bigger wins of up to 2,200x your bet with the Power Up mode.\n\nThe graphics are spot on with a cartoon style that beautifully represents the lively Mexican wrestling culture. The background has a wrestling ring while the game is filled with enthusiastic fans, Spanish guitar music, and explosive trumpet sounds. Symbols include A, K, Q, and J, as well as various luchadores, such as El Diablo, Martio, Burro, and the duo Sal and Pepe. You will also see Violeta, the ring girl, and Ricco, the referee, as well as a wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\n\nLucha Legends is perfect for gamblers who love a thrilling slot game. It has an exciting atmosphere that was missing from Microgaming's casino games in 2018. The features and bonus symbols of Lucha Legends are decent, especially with the extra quid of the Power Up mode. The Super Wild feature is randomly activated and can give you a wild multiplier of 2x or 3x or 2 extra wilds added to the reels.\n\nOpting for the Power Up mode doubles your bet, but it makes the Super Wild feature even more valuable. You can enjoy a wild multiplier of 3x or 5x, or get 4 additional wilds on your reels. The frequency of the Super Wild feature also increases dramatically in Power Up mode. The Free Spins feature is triggered when you land 3 wrestling belt scatters on reels 1, 3, and 5 simultaneously, and gives you 10 free spins. Any landing with a wild symbol will become a Super Wild to potentially multiply your wins by up to 5x with the Power Up mode or add 4 extra wilds on every single free spin.\n\nOverall, Lucha Legends is a fantastic slot game that's perfect for those who love the theme, vibrant graphics, and engaging features.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nLucha Legends slot game overview\nSuper Wild function and Power Up mode\nFree Spins feature\nGame graphics and design\nMaximum win potential\nSimilar slot games\nGame developer - Microgaming\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Lucha Legends\nIntroducing Lucha Legends! With sweet Spanish guitar sounds and a wrestling ring waiting for you in the background, this slot game celebrates all the traditional luchadores wrestling culture that we all know a little bit about, but rarely more than those colorful masks (unless you are Mexican).\nStep into the ring and fight for glory in Microgaming's Lucha Legends - with 5 reels and 25 paylines, this Mexican wrestling-themed slot features a Super Wild function where a wild multiplier of up to 3x or 2 extra wilds are randomly added to the reels - if you opt for the Power Up mode, you can get 4 extra wilds and wild multipliers up to 5x. In the Free Spins function, you start with 10 free spins but can win more - any wild landing triggers the Super Wild function for more explosive wins. This can lead to wins of up to 2,200 times your bet on each spin with the Power Up mode selected.\nVery Mexican Graphics\nLucha Legends is a 5-reel, 25-payline slot produced by Microgaming with a Mexican wrestling theme. Playable on all devices from 25 cents to €75 per spin, you have a normal and Power Up mode to start - there is a Super Wild feature where you can get wild multipliers up to 5x or up to 4 extra wilds. There is also a Free Spins feature where the Super Wild function comes into play whenever a wild lands.\nVisually, Lucha Legends has a cartoon-style graphics and a distinct Mexican wrestling theme - with a wrestling ring in the background, this colorful game features crowds of fans, loud Spanish guitar music, and the explosive triumph of trumpets. Among the symbols on the reels are A, K, Q and J, i.e., Poker card symbols, as well as various luchadores - there are El Diablo, Martio, Burro, and the duo Sal and Pepe. You will also see ring girl Violeta and referee Ricco on the reels - there is also a wild that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\nThis Lucha Legends slot game requires exclamation points. The landscapes, sounds, and Luchador all bring an atmosphere of excitement that frankly was missing in Microgaming casino games in 2018.\nBut before we talk too much about the graphics, we need to emphasize that this is a fun 5-reel, 25-payline machine with decent bonus features, even with the extra quid of Power Up.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nLucha Legends features a Super Wild function that is randomly activated in the base game - a wild multiplier of 2x or 3x will be applied to your wins or 2 extra wilds will be added to the reels. Now, this is what you will get if you play in normal mode.\nIf you opt for the Power Up mode, your bet will be doubled - this means you'll spin the reels from 50p to €75 per spin (instead of 25 cents to €37.50 per spin). Yes, it costs you twice as much, but the Super Wild function becomes much more valuable - when activated, a wild multiplier of 3x or 5x is applied, or 4 additional wilds are placed on the reels. The frequency of the Super Wild function also increases dramatically.\nLucha Legends also has a Free Spins feature that is triggered when you get 3 wrestling belt scatters on reels 1, 3, and 5 simultaneously - this will give you 10 free spins. During the feature, 3 scatters will retrigger the feature while 2 will give you 1 extra free spin. During the Free Spins feature, any wild symbol landing becomes a Superb Wild - this can lead to multipliers up to 5x (with the Power Up mode) or 4 extra wilds on every single free spin.\nThe Lucha Legends slot is truly worthwhile if you like the theme - it's colorful, fun, and explosive. It also has decent bonus features. It's all about the Super Wild functionality, so if you can use the Power Up mode, your winnings will be much bigger. In normal mode, you can win up to 960 times your bet with the 3x wild multiplier, while the Power Up mode allows you to win 2,200 times your bet on each spin with a 5x wild multiplier.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the theme, it's worth playing Yggdrasil Gaming's Lucha Maniacs and Thunderkick's Luchadora.

With sweet Spanish guitar sounds and a wrestling ring waiting for you in the background, this slot game celebrates all the traditional luchadores wrestling culture that we all know a little bit about, but rarely more than those colorful masks (unless you are Mexican).\nStep into the ring and fight for glory in Microgaming's Lucha Legends - with 5 reels and 25 paylines, this Mexican wrestling-themed slot features a Super Wild function where a wild multiplier of up to 3x or 2 extra wilds are randomly added to the reels - if you opt for the Power Up mode, you can get 4 extra wilds and wild multipliers up to 5x. In the Free Spins function, you start with 10 free spins but can win more - any wild landing triggers the Super Wild function for more explosive wins. This can lead to wins of up to 2,200 times your bet on each spin with the Power Up mode selected.\nVery Mexican Graphics\nLucha Legends is a 5-reel, 25-payline slot produced by Microgaming with a Mexican wrestling theme. Playable on all devices from 25 cents to €75 per spin, you have a normal and Power Up mode to start - there is a Super Wild feature where you can get wild multipliers up to 5x or up to 4 extra wilds. There is also a Free Spins feature where the Super Wild function comes into play whenever a wild lands.\nVisually, Lucha Legends has a cartoon-style graphics and a distinct Mexican wrestling theme - with a wrestling ring in the background, this colorful game features crowds of fans, loud Spanish guitar music, and the explosive triumph of trumpets. Among the symbols on the reels are A, K, Q and J, i.e., Poker card symbols, as well as various luchadores - there are El Diablo, Martio, Burro, and the duo Sal and Pepe. You will also see ring girl Violeta and referee Ricco on the reels - there is also a wild that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\nThis Lucha Legends slot game requires exclamation points. The landscapes, sounds, and Luchador all bring an atmosphere of excitement that frankly was missing in Microgaming casino games in 2018.\nBut before we talk too much about the graphics, we need to emphasize that this is a fun 5-reel, 25-payline machine with decent bonus features, even with the extra quid of Power Up.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nLucha Legends features a Super Wild function that is randomly activated in the base game - a wild multiplier of 2x or 3x will be applied to your wins or 2 extra wilds will be added to the reels. Now, this is what you will get if you play in normal mode.\nIf you opt for the Power Up mode, your bet will be doubled - this means you'll spin the reels from 50p to €75 per spin (instead of 25 cents to €37.50 per spin). Yes, it costs you twice as much, but the Super Wild function becomes much more valuable - when activated, a wild multiplier of 3x or 5x is applied, or 4 additional wilds are placed on the reels. The frequency of the Super Wild function also increases dramatically.\nLucha Legends also has a Free Spins feature that is triggered when you get 3 wrestling belt scatters on reels 1, 3, and 5 simultaneously - this will give you 10 free spins. During the feature, 3 scatters will retrigger the feature while 2 will give you 1 extra free spin. During the Free Spins feature, any wild symbol landing becomes a Superb Wild - this can lead to multipliers up to 5x (with the Power Up mode) or 4 extra wilds on every single free spin.\nThe Lucha Legends slot is truly worthwhile if you like the theme - it's colorful, fun, and explosive. It also has decent bonus features. It's all about the Super Wild functionality, so if you can use the Power Up mode, your winnings will be much bigger. In normal mode, you can win up to 960 times your bet with the 3x wild multiplier, while the Power Up mode allows you to win 2,200 times your bet on each spin with a 5x wild multiplier.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the theme, it's worth playing Yggdrasil Gaming's Lucha Maniacs and Thunderkick's Luchadora. The latter is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot from Yggdrasil Gaming that can be played from just 20 cents per spin on all devices. This Mexican wrestling-inspired title features a Free Spin Mode where you can start with up to 30 free spins - then make choices to win more free spins, random wilds, sticky wilds, 3x multipliers on a wrestler, wild wrestlers, stacked wrestlers, and tag team symbols. If you opt for the Golden Bet feature, you'll get an additional choice for even bigger wins.\n            ",

With sweet Spanish guitar sounds and a wrestling ring waiting for you in the background, this slot game celebrates all the traditional luchadores wrestling culture that we all know a little bit about, but rarely more than those colorful masks (unless you are Mexican).\nStep into the ring and fight for glory in Microgaming's Lucha Legends - with 5 reels and 25 paylines, this Mexican wrestling-themed slot features a Super Wild function where a wild multiplier of up to 3x or 2 extra wilds are randomly added to the reels - if you opt for the Power Up mode, you can get 4 extra wilds and wild multipliers up to 5x. In the Free Spins function, you start with 10 free spins but can win more - any wild landing triggers the Super Wild function for more explosive wins. This can lead to wins of up to 2,200 times your bet on each spin with the Power Up mode selected.\nVery Mexican Graphics\nLucha Legends is a 5-reel, 25-payline slot produced by Microgaming with a Mexican wrestling theme. Playable on all devices from 25 cents to €75 per spin, you have a normal and Power Up mode to start - there is a Super Wild feature where you can get wild multipliers up to 5x or up to 4 extra wilds. There is also a Free Spins feature where the Super Wild function comes into play whenever a wild lands.\nVisually, Lucha Legends has a cartoon-style graphics and a distinct Mexican wrestling theme - with a wrestling ring in the background, this colorful game features crowds of fans, loud Spanish guitar music, and the explosive triumph of trumpets. Among the symbols on the reels are A, K, Q and J, i.e., Poker card symbols, as well as various luchadores - there are El Diablo, Martio, Burro, and the duo Sal and Pepe. You will also see ring girl Violeta and referee Ricco on the reels - there is also a wild that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\nThis Lucha Legends slot game requires exclamation points. The landscapes, sounds, and Luchador all bring an atmosphere of excitement that frankly was missing in Microgaming casino games in 2018.\nBut before we talk too much about the graphics, we need to emphasize that this is a fun 5-reel, 25-payline machine with decent bonus features, even with the extra quid of Power Up.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nLucha Legends features a Super Wild function that is randomly activated in the base game - a wild multiplier of 2x or 3x will be applied to your wins or 2 extra wilds will be added to the reels. Now, this is what you will get if you play in normal mode.\nIf you opt for the Power Up mode, your bet will be doubled - this means you'll spin the reels from 50p to €75 per spin (instead of 25 cents to €37.50 per spin). Yes, it costs you twice as much, but the Super Wild function becomes much more valuable - when activated, a wild multiplier of 3x or 5x is applied, or 4 additional wilds are placed on the reels. The frequency of the Super Wild function also increases dramatically.\nLucha Legends also has a Free Spins feature that is triggered when you get 3 wrestling belt scatters on reels 1, 3, and 5 simultaneously - this will give you 10 free spins. During the feature, 3 scatters will retrigger the feature while 2 will give you 1 extra free spin. During the Free Spins feature, any wild symbol landing becomes a Superb Wild - this can lead to multipliers up to 5x (with the Power Up mode) or 4 extra wilds on every single free spin.\nThe Lucha Legends slot is truly worthwhile if you like the theme - it's colorful, fun, and explosive. It also has decent bonus features. It's all about the Super Wild functionality, so if you can use the Power Up mode, your winnings will be much bigger. In normal mode, you can win up to 960 times your bet with the 3x wild multiplier, while the Power Up mode allows you to win 2,200 times your bet on each spin with a 5x wild multiplier.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the theme, it's worth playing Yggdrasil Gaming's Lucha Maniacs and Thunderkick's Luchadora. The latter is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot from Yggdrasil Gaming that can be played from just 20 cents per spin on all devices. This Mexican wrestling-inspired title features a Free Spin Mode where you can start with up to 30 free spins - then make choices to win more free spins, random wilds, sticky wilds, 3x multipliers on a wrestler, wild wrestlers, stacked wrestlers, and tag team symbols. If you opt for the Golden Bet feature, you'll get an additional choice for even bigger wins.\n            ",
