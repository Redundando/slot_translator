Three are needed for the feature to begin. The first step is spinning a wheel with segments, each of which contains a prize. Available options include the Hit & Spin Free Spins function, Money Grab Bonus game, or one of three Jackpots.\n\nThe Money Grab Feature: When three Wilds land, core multipliers ranging from 3x to 50x can be randomly launched from the bag next to the grid.\n\nHit & Win: The safe symbol and the bundle of notes symbol initiate this feature.

Light & Wonder has made it their own by creating an online version with an exciting and dynamic slot machine.\n\nRich Uncle Pennybags, the affluent character now simply known as Mr. Monopoly, is the game's focus and appears to the left of the grid. He plays an active role in the Hit & Spin feature, but we'll delve into that in more detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nMonopoly Money Grab is set in a room full of banknotes, bullion, and gold coins. All the symbols are expertly designed, and there are some interesting animations to liven up the gameplay.\n\nThe soundtrack features racy music with trumpet solos over an electronic base.\n\nKey Features of Monopoly Money Grab\n\nBefore beginning to play, we must first decide how much to wager. Bets are accessible to everyone, starting from a minimum of €0.20 for all 25 paylines arranged on a grid of 5 reels and 3 rows.\n\nTo win, we must match at least three identical symbols on adjacent reels, always from left to right. There are two features that speed up the fall of the symbols: Quick Spin is the first, which rotates the reels quickly, while Autoplay is the second, allowing for between 5 and 100 automatic spins to be set.\n\nThe maximum payout is 5,000 times the wager, which can be achieved thanks to the high volatility and an RTP of 96%.\n\nHow to Play Monopoly Money Grab\n\nThere are a total of 9 symbols, 5 of low value and 4 with high value. Card symbols from ten to ace belong to the first group, while the second group features the cylinder, the boot, the dog, and Mr. Monopoly himself.\n\nLet's now examine the special symbols, starting with the Wild, which substitutes for all symbols except the Scatters, of which there are three:\n\nBonus Wheel: This appears only on the base game reels 1, 3, and 5. Three are needed for the feature to begin. The first step is spinning a wheel with segments, each of which contains a prize. Available options include the Hit & Spin Free Spins function, Money Grab Bonus game, or one of three Jackpots.\n\nThe Money Grab Feature: When three Wilds land, core multipliers ranging from 3x to 50x can be randomly launched from the bag next to the grid.\n\nHit & Win: The safe symbol and the bundle of notes symbol initiate this feature. Mr. Monopoly jumps onto the first reel and several multipliers ranging from 1x to 5x are added. If the safe symbol appears during Free Spins, three rows are added, bringing the total to six, and several multipliers are awarded.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the maximum payout of Monopoly Money Grab?\n\nIn this game, you can win a sum equal to 5,000 times the wager.\n\nHow many Scatters are there?\n\nThere are three Scatter symbols in this game.\n\nWhere can I play Monopoly Money Grab?\n\nThis game is available on all legal casinos certified by the government.\n            ",
