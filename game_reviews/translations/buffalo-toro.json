Set in the Nevada desert, this epic slot is sure to excite fans of the series with its stunning cartoon graphics and Western-themed soundtrack.\n\nWith a grid of 6 reels and 4 rows, and a whopping 4,096 ways to win, Buffalo Toro offers a minimum bet of 0.20 € and a maximum of 50€. The Autoplay feature allows players to set spins to run automatically, perfect for those who want to sit back and enjoy the action.\n\nThe game features low-value card symbols, as well as high-paying symbols inspired by the wildlife of the desert, including bears, wolves, and, of course, buffaloes. The Walking Wild symbol, represented by a bull with a headdress, generates respins as it moves left with each spin. The classic Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols, while the sunset postcard has the same function, but multiplies wins by 2 or 3.\n\nThe Matador symbol grants a respin and stays locked in place on the reels. If a bull appears at the same time, the Toro Goes Wild feature is triggered, allowing the bull to move towards the Matador, leaving a trail of Wilds behind. The game ends when the last bull leaves the leftmost reel.\n\nThe Golden Bison coin is the Scatter symbol, offering 8 to 20 free spins and filling a counter with corresponding symbols that disappear when completed to be replaced by more golden bisons. The Super Bonus symbol activates the Rampage Reels feature, causing only gold bison symbols to land on the reels.\n\nWith a theoretical RTP of 94% and high volatility, Buffalo Toro is a wild ride for experienced gamblers and offers a maximum win of 50,000 times the bet.

The first group includes playing cards from nine to ace, while the second group includes the bear, wolf, lynx, eagle, and buffalo.\n\nThere are three Wild symbols: the classic one replaces all regular symbols, but not special ones. A second wild is the postcard of the sunset, which has the same functions as the classic Wild, but also multiplies the win by x2 or x3.

The minimum bet is €0.20 and the maximum bet is €50. The Autoplay feature allows for automatic spins. The slot game has a theoretical RTP value of 94% and high volatility.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nThe game is set in Nevada and has a cartoon-style graphics throughout. The symbols represent the fauna of the desert, including bears, wolves, lynx, eagles, buffaloes, and more. The sound effects are reminiscent of old western films.\n\nBonus features\n\nThe game features regular symbols and three types of Wilds: classic, multiplier, and Walking Wild. The Walking Wild generates Respins by moving to the left with every play. The gold coin with the bison is the Scatter and awards 8 to 20 Free Spins. The Super Bonus symbol triggers the Rampage Reels function, and the player sees only golden bison symbols landing on the reels. The Matador gives a Respin and stays locked on the reels, and if a Bull appears on the reels at the same time, then the Toro Goes Wild function is triggered. The Bull moves towards the Matador and leaves a trail of Wild symbols behind.\n\nCompatibility and accessibility\n\nThe slot game is available to play on PCs, tablets, and smartphones. The game has fluid gameplay on all devices.\n\nPayouts and volatility\n\nThe game has high volatility, and the maximum win in Buffalo Toro is 50,000 times the bet.

Players can set their bets from a minimum of €0.20 up to a maximum of €50 per spin. The game features three Wild symbols, with one of them being a Walking Wild that generates respins by moving to the left with every play. Additionally, there is a Matador symbol that gives a Respin and stays locked on the reels when it appears.\n\nSymbols and graphics\n\nBuffalo Toro's symbols draw inspiration from the typical fauna of the desert area of Nevada, featuring creatures like bears, wolves, lynxes, eagles, and buffaloes. The graphic style of the game is cartoonish, with vivid colors and well-defined animations. Scatter symbols of a gold coin with a bison on it awards players with up to 20 free spins and a feature called Rampage Reels where only golden bison symbols land on the reels.\n\nBetting range\n\nThe minimum bet in Buffalo Toro is €0.20, and players can increase their wagers up to a maximum of €50 per spin. The game includes the Autoplay feature that allows players to set a number of automatic spins, making it easier for those who prefer not to have to click for every game.\n\nCompatibility\n\nBuffalo Toro can be played on a PC, tablet, and smartphone, maintaining the same level of quality and fluidity across platforms.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nBuffalo Toro's RTP is 94%, which is average for slots. Its volatility is high, meaning that while players can expect relatively large payouts, they might need to be patient until they hit a winning combination. The maximum win is 50,000 times the bet, which can be a tempting payout for some players.\n\n        \n            ",

Now Elk returns with Buffalo Toro, an epic slot machine that will not disappoint fans of the series.\n\nAs on previous occasions, the graphic style follows that of cartoons. Set in Nevada, the game opens with an animation of the bull flying over the world map chased by the matador. The symbols are inspired by the typical fauna of this desert area: bears, wolves and buffaloes, to name a few.\n\nThe music accompanying the spins is relentless, with sounds reminiscent of old western films.\n\nWhat to expect from Buffalo Toro\n\nThe slot features a grid with 6 reels and 4 rows and an impressive 4,096 ways to win. The minimum bet is €0.20, but it can be increased up to a maximum of €50. The Autoplay feature allows for automatic spins, a great function for those who don't want to click for every game.\n\nThe RTP value is not very high, at 94%, but it's worth remembering that this is a theoretical value calculated over thousands of games. The volatility is high.\n\nWalking Wild and many bonuses\n\nIn Buffalo Toro, we find low-value symbols and others that are more lucrative. The first group includes playing cards from nine to ace, while the second group includes the bear, wolf, lynx, eagle, and buffalo.\n\nThere are three Wild symbols: the classic one replaces all regular symbols, but not special ones. A second wild is the postcard of the sunset, which has the same functions as the classic Wild, but also multiplies the win by x2 or x3. Then there is the Walking Wild represented by the Bull with a Native American headdress. Its peculiarity is to generate Respins by moving to the left with every play.\n\nThe Matador, on the other hand, gives a Respin and stays locked on the reels. If a Bull appears on the reels at the same time, then the Toro Goes Wild function is triggered. In practice, the Bull moves towards the Matador, leaving behind a trail of Wild symbols. The game ends when the last Bull leaves the left reel.\n\nThe gold coin with the bison is our Scatter and gives 8 to 20 Free Spins. In the upper part, there is a counter with the icon of the symbols that is filled thanks to the golden bisons. For example, if the \"bear\" counter is completed, the corresponding symbol disappears and bisons appear in its place.\n\nWith the Super Bonus symbol, the Rampage Reels function is activated, and we will see only golden bison symbols landing on the reels.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nWhat is the maximum win in Buffalo Toro?\n\nThe maximum win is 50,000 times the bet.\n\nHow many Wilds are there in Buffalo Toro?\n\nThere are 3 Wilds: classic, multiplier, Walking Wild.\n\nCan I play Buffalo Toro on my smartphone?\n\nCertainly, you can play Buffalo Toro on a PC or tablet, without losing in fluidity.\n            ",

Now Elk returns with Buffalo Toro, an epic slot machine that will not disappoint fans of the series.\n\nAs on previous occasions, the graphic style follows that of cartoons. Set in Nevada, the game opens with an animation of the bull flying over the world map chased by the matador. The symbols are inspired by the typical fauna of this desert area: bears, wolves and buffaloes, to name a few.\n\nThe music accompanying the spins is relentless, with sounds reminiscent of old western films.\n\nWhat to expect from Buffalo Toro\n\nThe slot features a grid with 6 reels and 4 rows and an impressive 4,096 ways to win. The minimum bet is €0.20, but it can be increased up to a maximum of €50. The Autoplay feature allows for automatic spins, a great function for those who don't want to click for every game.\n\nThe RTP value is not very high, at 94%, but it's worth remembering that this is a theoretical value calculated over thousands of games. The volatility is high.\n\nWalking Wild and many bonuses\n\nIn Buffalo Toro, we find low-value symbols and others that are more lucrative. The first group includes playing cards from nine to ace, while the second group includes the bear, wolf, lynx, eagle, and buffalo.\n\nThere are three Wild symbols: the classic one replaces all regular symbols, but not special ones. A second wild is the postcard of the sunset, which has the same functions as the classic Wild, but also multiplies the win by x2 or x3. Then there is the Walking Wild represented by the Bull with a Native American headdress. Its peculiarity is to generate Respins by moving to the left with every play.\n\nThe Matador, on the other hand, gives a Respin and stays locked on the reels. If a Bull appears on the reels at the same time, then the Toro Goes Wild function is triggered. In practice, the Bull moves towards the Matador, leaving behind a trail of Wild symbols. The game ends when the last Bull leaves the left reel.\n\nThe gold coin with the bison is our Scatter and gives 8 to 20 Free Spins. In the upper part, there is a counter with the icon of the symbols that is filled thanks to the golden bisons. For example, if the \"bear\" counter is completed, the corresponding symbol disappears and bisons appear in its place.\n\nWith the Super Bonus symbol, the Rampage Reels function is activated, and we will see only golden bison symbols landing on the reels.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nWhat is the maximum win in Buffalo Toro?\n\nThe maximum win is 50,000 times the bet.\n\nHow many Wilds are there in Buffalo Toro?\n\nThere are 3 Wilds: classic, multiplier, Walking Wild.\n\nCan I play Buffalo Toro on my smartphone?\n\nCertainly, you can play Buffalo Toro on a PC or tablet, without losing in fluidity.\n        ",
