Ghost Glyph's graphics are truly horror-themed, with ghostly apparitions floating above the grid, ready to offer symbol modifiers and wilds.\n\nThe game features three types of symbols: gems, chips, and bonus symbols such as wilds and scatters. Clusters of winning symbols are marked by ghostly lights, and upon wins, symbols disappear in a cool evaporation effect. The audio is also well-suited to this game's mysterious theme.\n\nPlayers can look forward to an adventure that involves friendly ghosts, colorful gems, and exciting features that bring out the best of the supernatural. A jolly joker symbol replaces standard paying symbols, and a reel modifier collection feature can activate several flasks filled with great stuff. Overall, Ghost Glyph is a well-crafted game by Quickspin.\n\nIn this game, you can form clusters of winning symbols, resulting in a tumble mechanic. Winning symbols disappear, making way for new symbols to cascade in place. This cycle repeats until no more wins are obtained.\n\nA ghost glyph is added in an empty position, following the tumble mechanic. This glyph acts as a wild, and is collected in the ghost urn. The game selects five urns at random before the start of each round, with the blue urn being the last. Each urn has a unique feature, such as adding wilds to the reels, transforming low-paying symbols, removing low-paying symbols, and triggering free spins.\n\nGhost Glyph has a familiar control layout, with the spin button in a prominent orange rectangle in the lower right corner of the screen. To play, select your bet amount, and press the spin button. Other buttons include fast forward and autoplay. The betting range starts at 20 cents per spin for the minimum bet and goes up to 100 euros for the maximum bet.\n\nIf you're into ghost-themed slot games, you might want to check out Ghostbusters Level Up Plus, a dynamic game that can reveal multipliers of up to 25x, modify reels, and impress you with free spins.\u0019",

Experienced gamblers can embark on a medium-variance adventure with a theoretical return to player average of 96.00% or slightly higher. The maximum win potential is 2000x multiplied by the winning bet.\nQuickspin's spooky Halloween 2020 game is Ghost Glyph, a Cluster Pays slot machine with medium volatility that includes all sorts of interesting features.\nA ghostly and spectral event game on the reels has been summoned by Quickspin's expert slot developers as a grid slot. Players will find a wonderfully cute reel adventure that includes cascade or avalanche wins on a grid that does not have a fixed number of rows.\nA truly creepy graphic\nThe graphics and slot experts of the Swedish company chose a cheerful theme. Of course, we are joking. The ghosts that seem to float above the grid are not of the obsessive type, but only want to help, offering symbol modifiers and wilds.\nThe Ghost Glyph slot has symbols that can be divided into three categories: gems, coins, and extra symbols. Gems are high-yield symbols, coins are coin-shaped symbols with various engravings, and there are wilds and scatters.\nWinning results are marked by a spectral light around the group of symbols. In the case of a landslide victory, the symbols seem to evaporate into thin air in a cool way. The audio matches the game and fits perfectly with the theme.\nPlayers can experience an adventure that is not so spooky involving smiling ghosts, various colored gems, and a set of features capable of bringing out the best in the mysterious. A wild symbol replaces standard paying symbols, and a reel modifier collection function can unleash various vials filled with good stuff on the grid. All in all, the Ghost Glyph slot seems like a well-crafted game from Quickspin.\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nAs you form your winning symbol clusters and get paid, there will also be a Tumble Mechanic in play. Symbols that are part of these clusters will then be removed and allow new ones to fall from above. You can continue to get clusters and new tumbles in this way, until there are no more.\nThe Ghost Glyph Glyph is added in an empty position, following a Tumble mechanic. One is given for each of these mechanics and then used as a wild, and added to a Ghost Urn. New urns are activated every time this happens.\nBefore the round starts, the game chooses 5 random ghost urns, but you can always count on the blue urn being the final one. The first four will be randomized, using red, green, and yellow variants. As you get glyphs as part of your wins, these urns are activated one by one.\nThe yellow urn gives you more wilds on the reels, up to 10 added in a single round.\nThe green ghost urn, when activated, will transform one type of low-value symbol into another, also of low value.\nThrough the red ghost urn, you get the removal of low-value symbols, selecting a single random type.\nThe blue ghosts, the final ones you'll activate, will make you enter the bonus game with free spins.\nFinally, there is also the Massive Wild, which can be obtained at the end of free spins, under certain conditions. It is a feature with 22 levels.\nBefore starting to play, you need to familiarize yourself with the controls and buttons. These are located at the bottom of the game field, and as a Quickspin production, Ghost Glyph has the familiar look and layout found in most of this company's games.\nTo get straight to the point, the game button is the large orange rectangle in the bottom right corner of the screen.

You can get to any available betting amount by pressing the buttons up and down.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAre you ready to catch some ghosts and play for the chance to win on the IGT Ghostbusters Level Up Plus jackpot slot?

No, they won't make you rich in real life, but in this game, it's definitely possible. The coins, on the other hand, are coin-shaped symbols with various engravings. It's almost as if they were minted in a casino right before the game started.</p>\n\n              <p>But wait, there's more. Ghost Glyph also has wilds and scatters. It's like finding a secret sauce that you can dip your fries in. It's not essential, but it sure tastes good when you find it. New urns are activated every time a Ghost Glyph is added in an empty position. It's like unboxing a surprise package every time. Before the round starts, the game chooses five random ghost urns, but you can always count on the blue urn being the final one. The first four will be randomized, using red, green, and yellow variants.</p>\n\n              <p>If you're into surprises and a game that keeps you on the edge of your seat, Ghost Glyph is definitely worth checking out.

The Tumble mechanic is in play, allowing symbols that are part of a winning cluster to be removed and new ones to fall from above. Winning symbol clusters are marked by a spectral light, and a Ghost Glyph is added in an empty position as a wild following a Tumble mechanic. One is given for each of these mechanics and then used as a wild and added to a Ghost Urn. The game also includes a set of features that can bring out the best in the mysterious.\n\nSymbols and categories\n\nGhost Glyph has symbols that can be divided into three categories: gems, coins, and extra symbols. Gems are high-yield symbols, coins are coin-shaped symbols with various engravings, and there are wilds and scatters. New urns are activated every time a Ghost Glyph is added in an empty position. Before the round starts, the game chooses 5 random ghost urns, but you can always count on the blue urn being the final one. The first four will be randomized, using red, green, and yellow variants.\n\nTumble mechanic and Ghost Glyph\n\nSymbols that are part of winning clusters in Ghost Glyph are removed and allow new ones to fall from above. A Ghost Glyph is added in an empty position following a Tumble mechanic. One is given for each of these mechanics and then used as a wild and added to a Ghost Urn. New urns are activated every time this happens. There are five random ghost urns, but you can always count on the blue urn being the final one.\n\nUrn features\n\nAs you get Ghost Glyphs as part of your wins, urns are activated one by one. The yellow urn gives you more wilds on the reels, up to 10 added in a single round. The green ghost urn, when activated, will transform one type of low-value symbol into another also of low value. Through the red ghost urn, you get the removal of low-value symbols, selecting a single random type. The blue ghosts will make you enter the bonus game with free spins.\n\nMassive Wild feature\n\nFinally, there is also the Massive Wild, which can be obtained at the end of free spins, under certain conditions. It is a feature with 22 levels.\n\nAudio and theme\n\nThe graphics and audio of Quickspin's Ghost Glyph fit perfectly with the spooky, Halloween-themed game. The ghosts that float above the grid are not of the obsessive type, but only want to help, offering symbol modifiers and wilds. The audio matches the game and is in keeping with the cheerful but eerie theme.\n\nVolatility, RTP, and maximum win potential\n\nExperienced gamblers can embark on a medium-variance adventure with a theoretical return to player average of 96.00% or slightly higher. The maximum win potential is 2000x multiplied by the winning bet. The betting range starts at 20 cents per spin for the minimum bet and 100 euros for the maximum.\n\n        \n            ",

The maximum win potential is 2000x multiplied by the winning bet.\nQuickspin's spooky Halloween 2020 game is Ghost Glyph, a Cluster Pays slot machine with medium volatility that includes all sorts of interesting features.\nA ghostly and spectral event game on the reels has been summoned by Quickspin's expert slot developers as a grid slot. Players will find a wonderfully cute reel adventure that includes cascade or avalanche wins on a grid that does not have a fixed number of rows.\nA truly creepy graphic\nThe graphics and slot experts of the Swedish company chose a cheerful theme. Of course, we are joking. The ghosts that seem to float above the grid are not of the obsessive type, but only want to help, offering symbol modifiers and wilds.\nThe Ghost Glyph slot has symbols that can be divided into three categories: gems, coins, and extra symbols. Gems are high-yield symbols, coins are coin-shaped symbols with various engravings, and there are wilds and scatters.\nWinning results are marked by a spectral light around the group of symbols. In the case of a landslide victory, the symbols seem to evaporate into thin air in a cool way.

A wild symbol replaces standard paying symbols, and a reel modifier collection function can unleash various vials filled with good stuff on the grid. All in all, the Ghost Glyph slot seems like a well-crafted game from Quickspin.\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nAs you form your winning symbol clusters and get paid, there will also be a Tumble Mechanic in play. Symbols that are part of these clusters will then be removed and allow new ones to fall from above. You can continue to get clusters and new tumbles in this way, until there are no more.\nThe Ghost Glyph Glyph is added in an empty position, following a Tumble mechanic. One is given for each of these mechanics and then used as a wild, and added to a Ghost Urn. New urns are activated every time this happens.\nBefore the round starts, the game chooses 5 random ghost urns, but you can always count on the blue urn being the final one. The first four will be randomized, using red, green, and yellow variants. As you get glyphs as part of your wins, these urns are activated one by one.\nThe yellow urn gives you more wilds on the reels, up to 10 added in a single round.\nThe green ghost urn, when activated, will transform one type of low-value symbol into another, also of low value.\nThrough the red ghost urn, you get the removal of low-value symbols, selecting a single random type.\nThe blue ghosts, the final ones you'll activate, will make you enter the bonus game with free spins.\nFinally, there is also the Massive Wild, which can be obtained at the end of free spins, under certain conditions. It is a feature with 22 levels.\nBefore starting to play, you need to familiarize yourself with the controls and buttons.
