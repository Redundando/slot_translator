They replace all symbols except the gold lightbulb and tap (without the Wild inscription).\n\nIf the Wild symbols do not lead to a win, they remain fixed on the board until the first good combination.\n\nWhen two golden locomotives appear at either end of a group of symbols, the Railroad function is activated and all symbols become wagons.\n\nWith four golden locomotives forming a square, all symbols inside are transformed into carriages.\n\nIf a Wild carriage remains on the board after a cascade, it will transform into a golden Wild.\n\nDuring Spins, it may happen that the 3x3 Chance card appears, which is linked to a multiplier ranging from 5x to 1,000x.\n\nEvery time the golden water tap symbol appears, the water level in the column next to the grid will rise by one mark. When it is full, the Drinking Water function is activated: all winning symbol groups are locked on the board and the others are removed. Water released from the taps above the grid will enhance the symbols present.\n\nWhen the light bulb symbol appears, a mark will be added to the counter on the right. Upon reaching the threshold, the Electric Company game is activated. In this case, 3 free spins will be awarded during which symbols will be replaced by property cards, colored tiles, and chance cards that will increase our winnings.\n\nIf you manage to fill the board with Wilds, then you will win the \"Off the Rails\" jackpot.\n        ",

Commercialized since the 1930s, different editions have been released over the decades, some special ones linked to partnerships such as Disney. The Monopoly mascot is Rich Uncle Pennybags, a middle-aged man who wears an elegant suit and top hat. The game is simple. There is a board divided into 40 property squares that are assigned to the participants and on which it is possible to build houses and hotels. Each player throws dice and moves from square to square, when they land on another player's property they must pay an amount to the owner. Not all squares are property, there are also stations and two companies, the electric and the water company. Monopoly: Utility Trails is inspired by the latter.\n\nThe graphics have a Steampunk style, with pipes, taps and resistance bulbs. On the sides of the grid there are two counters, one for electricity and the other for water.\n\nOn the right there is the button for settings, the one for automatic spins and the Start. On the left there is a boiler that indicates the winning combinations during a single Spin.\n\nFeatures of the slot\nThe grid is very large, with 8 reels and 7 lines. The game system is cascading, so every time there is a winning combination the symbols explode and disappear, leaving free slots that will be filled with new adjacent symbols horizontally or vertically. You win with a minimum of 5 symbols and a maximum of 56.

They replace all symbols except the gold lightbulb and tap (without the Wild inscription).\n\nIf the Wild symbols do not lead to a win, they remain fixed on the board until the first good combination.\n\nWhen two golden locomotives appear at either end of a group of symbols, the Railroad function is activated and all symbols become wagons.\n\nWith four golden locomotives forming a square, all symbols inside are transformed into carriages.\n\nIf a Wild carriage remains on the board after a cascade, it will transform into a golden Wild.\n\nDuring Spins, it may happen that the 3x3 Chance card appears, which is linked to a multiplier ranging from 5x to 1,000x.\n\nEvery time the golden water tap symbol appears, the water level in the column next to the grid will rise by one mark. When it is full, the Drinking Water function is activated: all winning symbol groups are locked on the board and the others are removed. Water released from the taps above the grid will enhance the symbols present.\n\nWhen the light bulb symbol appears, a mark will be added to the counter on the right. Upon reaching the threshold, the Electric Company game is activated. In this case, 3 free spins will be awarded during which symbols will be replaced by property cards, colored tiles, and chance cards that will increase our winnings.\n\nIf you manage to fill the board with Wilds, then you will win the \"Off the Rails\" jackpot.\n            ",

Monopoly: Utility Trails boasts an RTP of 96.61%, which is pretty average for the world of virtual slots. However, before you start doing mental calculations and try to figure out the odds of your winning, let's remember it's still gambling and that numbers can be deceiving.</p>\n<p>But let's focus on the positive, 96.61% means you have a chance to win! Plus, it's way more likely to hit the jackpot in this game than crossing Park Place with a hotel on it on the board game Monopoly.

Winning combinations disappear and are replaced with new symbols, providing more opportunities to win. The game offers bonus features such as Wild symbols, Railroad function, Drinking Water function, Electric Company game, and a chance card multiplier. The minimum number of symbols for a win is 5, and the maximum is 56. The betting range is between €0.20 and €4, and the theoretical RTP is 96.61%.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nMonopoly: Utility Trails has a Steampunk style design, with pipes, taps, and bulbs to match the utility theme. The graphics enhance the gameplay experience, and the side counters add an exciting element to the game. The winning combinations are displayed on a boiler on the left while the various settings buttons such as autoplay and start are located on the right-hand side.\n\nBonuses and Special Features\n\nOne of the standout features of Monopoly: Utility Trails is the number of bonuses and special features. The game offers four Wild symbols: lightbulb, tap, carriage, and golden locomotive with the word Wild. When two golden locomotives appear, the Railroad function is activated. When four golden locomotives are arranged as a square, all symbols inside are turned into carriages, and if a Wild carriage appears, it will transform into a golden Wild. There is also a Chance card multiplier that can range from 5x to 1,000x. The Drinking Water function is activated when the golden water tap symbol appears, while the Electric Company game is activated when the light bulb symbol appears. Finally, filling the board with Wilds will trigger the Off the Rails jackpot.\n\nBetting Range and Jackpot\n\nThe minimum bet in Monopoly: Utility Trails is €0.20, while the max bet is €4. The game offers an Off the Rails jackpot if the play manages to fill the board with Wilds.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP) Percentage\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) percentage in Monopoly: Utility Trails is 96.61%, which is among the average rates in the online slot industry.\n\n        \n            ",

Commercialized since the 1930s, different editions have been released over the decades, some special ones linked to partnerships such as Disney. The Monopoly mascot is Rich Uncle Pennybags, a middle-aged man who wears an elegant suit and top hat. The game is simple. There is a board divided into 40 property squares that are assigned to the participants and on which it is possible to build houses and hotels. Each player throws dice and moves from square to square, when they land on another player's property they must pay an amount to the owner. Not all squares are property, there are also stations and two companies, the electric and the water company. Monopoly: Utility Trails is inspired by the latter.\n\nThe graphics have a Steampunk style, with pipes, taps and resistance bulbs. On the sides of the grid there are two counters, one for electricity and the other for water.\n\nOn the right there is the button for settings, the one for automatic spins and the Start. On the left there is a boiler that indicates the winning combinations during a single Spin.\n\nFeatures of the slot\nThe grid is very large, with 8 reels and 7 lines. The game system is cascading, so every time there is a winning combination the symbols explode and disappear, leaving free slots that will be filled with new adjacent symbols horizontally or vertically. You win with a minimum of 5 symbols and a maximum of 56. The bet ranges from €0.20 to €4.\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.61%.\n\nSymbols and features\nOne of the aspects that we liked most about Monopoly: Utility Trails is the game system, which provides numerous bonuses and special features.\n\nThe symbols that pay the least are gemstones, while much more rewarding are the top hat, ship, dog and car.\n\nWe have 4 Wilds: Lightbulb, tap, carriage and golden locomotive, all with the word Wild. They replace all symbols except the gold lightbulb and tap (without the Wild inscription).\n\nIf the Wild symbols do not lead to a win, they remain fixed on the board until the first good combination.\n\nWhen two golden locomotives appear at either end of a group of symbols, the Railroad function is activated and all symbols become wagons.\n\nWith four golden locomotives forming a square, all symbols inside are transformed into carriages.\n\nIf a Wild carriage remains on the board after a cascade, it will transform into a golden Wild.\n\nDuring Spins, it may happen that the 3x3 Chance card appears, which is linked to a multiplier ranging from 5x to 1,000x.\n\nEvery time the golden water tap symbol appears, the water level in the column next to the grid will rise by one mark. When it is full, the Drinking Water function is activated: all winning symbol groups are locked on the board and the others are removed. Water released from the taps above the grid will enhance the symbols present.\n\nWhen the light bulb symbol appears, a mark will be added to the counter on the right. Upon reaching the threshold, the Electric Company game is activated. In this case, 3 free spins will be awarded during which symbols will be replaced by property cards, colored tiles, and chance cards that will increase our winnings.\n\nIf you manage to fill the board with Wilds, then you will win the \"Off the Rails\" jackpot.\n            ",

On the sides of the grid there are two counters, one for electricity and the other for water.\n\nOn the right there is the button for settings, the one for automatic spins and the Start. On the left there is a boiler that indicates the winning combinations during a single Spin.\n\nFeatures of the slot\nThe grid is very large, with 8 reels and 7 lines. The game system is cascading, so every time there is a winning combination the symbols explode and disappear, leaving free slots that will be filled with new adjacent symbols horizontally or vertically. You win with a minimum of 5 symbols and a maximum of 56. The bet ranges from €0.20 to €4.\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.61%.\n\nSymbols and features\nOne of the aspects that we liked most about Monopoly: Utility Trails is the game system, which provides numerous bonuses and special features.\n\nThe symbols that pay the least are gemstones, while much more rewarding are the top hat, ship, dog and car.\n\nWe have 4 Wilds: Lightbulb, tap, carriage and golden locomotive, all with the word Wild. They replace all symbols except the gold lightbulb and tap (without the Wild inscription).\n\nIf the Wild symbols do not lead to a win, they remain fixed on the board until the first good combination.\n\nWhen two golden locomotives appear at either end of a group of symbols, the Railroad function is activated and all symbols become wagons.\n\nWith four golden locomotives forming a square, all symbols inside are transformed into carriages.\n\nIf a Wild carriage remains on the board after a cascade, it will transform into a golden Wild.\n\nDuring Spins, it may happen that the 3x3 Chance card appears, which is linked to a multiplier ranging from 5x to 1,000x.\n\nEvery time the golden water tap symbol appears, the water level in the column next to the grid will rise by one mark. When it is full, the Drinking Water function is activated: all winning symbol groups are locked on the board and the others are removed. Water released from the taps above the grid will enhance the symbols present.\n\nWhen the light bulb symbol appears, a mark will be added to the counter on the right. Upon reaching the threshold, the Electric Company game is activated. In this case, 3 free spins will be awarded during which symbols will be replaced by property cards, colored tiles, and chance cards that will increase our winnings.\n\nIf you manage to fill the board with Wilds, then you will win the \"Off the Rails\" jackpot.\n            ",

Commercialized since the 1930s, different editions have been released over the decades, some special ones linked to partnerships such as Disney. The Monopoly mascot is Rich Uncle Pennybags, a middle-aged man who wears an elegant suit and top hat. The game is simple. There is a board divided into 40 property squares that are assigned to the participants and on which it is possible to build houses and hotels. Each player throws dice and moves from square to square, when they land on another player's property they must pay an amount to the owner. Not all squares are property, there are also stations and two companies, the electric and the water company. Monopoly: Utility Trails is inspired by the latter.\n\nThe graphics have a Steampunk style, with pipes, taps and resistance bulbs. On the sides of the grid there are two counters, one for electricity and the other for water.\n\nOn the right there is the button for settings, the one for automatic spins and the Start.

The game system is cascading, so every time there is a winning combination the symbols explode and disappear, leaving free slots that will be filled with new adjacent symbols horizontally or vertically.
