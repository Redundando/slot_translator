Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nColossal Gems overview\nGameplay and bonus features\nLow volatility and high RTP\nAutospin function\nProgressive Jackpot Race\nPlayable on any device\nPart of a wide range of online slot games\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Colossal Gems\nThis Habanero game titled Colossal Gems is a free slot designed for those who love anything that sparkles with cartoon-like gems. Nobody can resist a dazzling gem, and that's what makes this game so visually appealing. Its low volatility makes it suitable even for beginners. To discover the tricks and extra features, I invite you to read the following paragraphs and register to receive your no-deposit bonus instantly!\n\nStructure of Colossal Gems Slot\nThe game is structured in a 6x5 format on 30 paylines with respins, free spins, and giant gem symbols of mega sizes. It has an RTP of 96.72% and low volatility, which means small but frequent winnings. The game is a fun gem-themed adventure appreciated by both purist slot players and amateur beginners. Bonus features include a free spins feature after three consecutive respins. Both free spins and respins feature giant gem symbols in the following sizes: 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4.\n\nHow does Colossal Gems slot work?\nFirst, locate the Bet Level buttons, which are found in the lower toolbar to the left of the spin button. Choose a betting level of 1, 2, 5, 7, or 10.\n\nNow locate the Coin Amount buttons to the right of the selection button. These start at 0.01 and go up to 20.00. These amounts are multiplied together for the line bet and then by 30 (for the paylines) to make the total bet.\n\nThe minimum bet per line is therefore 0.01 and the minimum total bet is 0.30€. The maximum bet per line is 200.00€ and the maximum total bet is 6000.00€\n\nPlayers wishing to execute Autospin can choose the button to the right of the selection button. You can select between 10 and 500 Autospin.\n\nPress the I button in the lower right of the screen to view the Paytable.\n\nIn the lower right of the screen, there is a volume button to activate or deactivate sounds and a lightning icon that you can hit to activate the game in Turbo mode.\n\nThere you go, now you're ready to play. Hit the big selection button in the center of the screen and admire the movement of the sparkling gems!\n\nHow do the Colossal Gems Respins and Free Spins function?\nBlock Function\nEach base game win translates into a cluster. A winning block translates to another cluster until new wins occur or three respins are reached. The respin feature guarantees giant gems as follows:\nFirst Respin - 2x2 Gem\nSecond Respin - 3x3 Gem\nThird Respin - 4x4 Gem\n\nFree Spins Feature\nA series of 3 consecutive respins triggers the Free Spins feature. During this feature, the player enjoys 6 free spins and the wild purple gem comes into play. Any symbol can land as a 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4 size gem at any time; in fact, one of these is guaranteed on every spin.\n\nThe game also features a progressive Jackpot Race; the growing pot can be seen in the top left of the screens.\n\nFinal thoughts on the precious Colossal Gems Slot\nI found this slot from Habanero software very playful thanks to its colorful and dynamic graphics. The most original components of this game include the mega-sized symbols (2x2, 3x3, and 4x4). These come into play in both the respin version and the free spin version, both of which prove to be great potential earnings sources. The Gem theme isn't new, and if you like this slot you might want to try some alternatives in our library like the Gems Gems Gems slot from WMS and Sizzling Gems from Novomatic to name just two of the most popular ones. Our free slots are ready to be activated in the browser at any time, using virtually any device, including a mobile phone. You'll find thousands of the best slot titles by clicking right here!\n\nFAQ – Most Frequently Asked Questions about Colossal Gems:\nWhat other Bonus features are there?\nBoth the Respin and Free Spins are equipped with Mega Gems of 2x3, 3x3, and 4x4.\n\nDoes the game have a free spins round?\nYes. Six free spins are awarded after three consecutive respins.\n\nWhat is the maximum bet in Colossal Gems?\nThe maximum total bet is 6000,00€.\n\nWhat is the minimum bet on Colossal Gems?\nThe minimum total bet is 0.30€.\n\nWhat is the biggest win available on Colossal Gems?\nFive purple games pay x1800.\n\nHow volatile are the Colossal Gems?\nThe game is not very volatile – it has low variance.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the giant gems?\nThe game has an RTP of 96.72%.\n            ",

Nobody can resist a dazzling gem, and that's what makes this game so visually appealing. Its low volatility makes it suitable even for beginners. To discover the tricks and extra features, I invite you to read the following paragraphs and register to receive your no-deposit bonus instantly!\n\nStructure of Colossal Gems Slot\nThe game is structured in a 6x5 format on 30 paylines with respins, free spins, and giant gem symbols of mega sizes. It has an RTP of 96.72% and low volatility, which means small but frequent winnings. The game is a fun gem-themed adventure appreciated by both purist slot players and amateur beginners. Bonus features include a free spins feature after three consecutive respins. Both free spins and respins feature giant gem symbols in the following sizes: 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4.\n\nHow does Colossal Gems slot work?\nFirst, locate the Bet Level buttons, which are found in the lower toolbar to the left of the spin button. Choose a betting level of 1, 2, 5, 7, or 10.\n\nNow locate the Coin Amount buttons to the right of the selection button. These start at 0.01 and go up to 20.00. These amounts are multiplied together for the line bet and then by 30 (for the paylines) to make the total bet.\n\nThe minimum bet per line is therefore 0.01 and the minimum total bet is 0.30€. The maximum bet per line is 200.00€ and the maximum total bet is 6000.00€\n\nPlayers wishing to execute Autospin can choose the button to the right of the selection button. You can select between 10 and 500 Autospin.\n\nPress the I button in the lower right of the screen to view the Paytable.\n\nIn the lower right of the screen, there is a volume button to activate or deactivate sounds and a lightning icon that you can hit to activate the game in Turbo mode.\n\nThere you go, now you're ready to play. Hit the big selection button in the center of the screen and admire the movement of the sparkling gems!\n\nHow do the Colossal Gems Respins and Free Spins function?\nBlock Function\nEach base game win translates into a cluster. A winning block translates to another cluster until new wins occur or three respins are reached. The respin feature guarantees giant gems as follows:\nFirst Respin - 2x2 Gem\nSecond Respin - 3x3 Gem\nThird Respin - 4x4 Gem\n\nFree Spins Feature\nA series of 3 consecutive respins triggers the Free Spins feature. During this feature, the player enjoys 6 free spins and the wild purple gem comes into play. Any symbol can land as a 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4 size gem at any time; in fact, one of these is guaranteed on every spin.\n\nThe game also features a progressive Jackpot Race; the growing pot can be seen in the top left of the screens.\n\nFinal thoughts on the precious Colossal Gems Slot\nI found this slot from Habanero software very playful thanks to its colorful and dynamic graphics. The most original components of this game include the mega-sized symbols (2x2, 3x3, and 4x4). These come into play in both the respin version and the free spin version, both of which prove to be great potential earnings sources. The Gem theme isn't new, and if you like this slot you might want to try some alternatives in our library like the Gems Gems Gems slot from WMS and Sizzling Gems from Novomatic to name just two of the most popular ones. Our free slots are ready to be activated in the browser at any time, using virtually any device, including a mobile phone. You'll find thousands of the best slot titles by clicking right here!\n\nFAQ – Most Frequently Asked Questions about Colossal Gems:\nWhat other Bonus features are there?\nBoth the Respin and Free Spins are equipped with Mega Gems of 2x3, 3x3, and 4x4.\n\nDoes the game have a free spins round?\nYes. Six free spins are awarded after three consecutive respins.\n\nWhat is the maximum bet in Colossal Gems?\nThe maximum total bet is 6000,00€.\n\nWhat is the minimum bet on Colossal Gems?\nThe minimum total bet is 0.30€.\n\nWhat is the biggest win available on Colossal Gems?\nFive purple games pay x1800.\n\nHow volatile are the Colossal Gems?\nThe game is not very volatile – it has low variance.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the giant gems?\nThe game has an RTP of 96.72%.\n            ",

Nobody can resist a dazzling gem, and that's what makes this game so visually appealing. Its low volatility makes it suitable even for beginners. To discover the tricks and extra features, I invite you to read the following paragraphs and register to receive your no-deposit bonus instantly!\n\nStructure of Colossal Gems Slot\nThe game is structured in a 6x5 format on 30 paylines with respins, free spins, and giant gem symbols of mega sizes. It has an RTP of 96.72% and low volatility, which means small but frequent winnings. The game is a fun gem-themed adventure appreciated by both purist slot players and amateur beginners. Bonus features include a free spins feature after three consecutive respins. Both free spins and respins feature giant gem symbols in the following sizes: 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4.\n\nHow does Colossal Gems slot work?\nFirst, locate the Bet Level buttons, which are found in the lower toolbar to the left of the spin button. Choose a betting level of 1, 2, 5, 7, or 10.\n\nNow locate the Coin Amount buttons to the right of the selection button. These start at 0.01 and go up to 20.00. These amounts are multiplied together for the line bet and then by 30 (for the paylines) to make the total bet.\n\nThe minimum bet per line is therefore 0.01 and the minimum total bet is 0.30€. The maximum bet per line is 200.00€ and the maximum total bet is 6000.00€\n\nPlayers wishing to execute Autospin can choose the button to the right of the selection button. You can select between 10 and 500 Autospin.\n\nPress the I button in the lower right of the screen to view the Paytable.\n\nIn the lower right of the screen, there is a volume button to activate or deactivate sounds and a lightning icon that you can hit to activate the game in Turbo mode.\n\nThere you go, now you're ready to play. Hit the big selection button in the center of the screen and admire the movement of the sparkling gems!\n\nHow do the Colossal Gems Respins and Free Spins function?\nBlock Function\nEach base game win translates into a cluster. A winning block translates to another cluster until new wins occur or three respins are reached. The respin feature guarantees giant gems as follows:\nFirst Respin - 2x2 Gem\nSecond Respin - 3x3 Gem\nThird Respin - 4x4 Gem\n\nFree Spins Feature\nA series of 3 consecutive respins triggers the Free Spins feature. During this feature, the player enjoys 6 free spins and the wild purple gem comes into play. Any symbol can land as a 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4 size gem at any time; in fact, one of these is guaranteed on every spin.\n\nThe game also features a progressive Jackpot Race; the growing pot can be seen in the top left of the screens.\n\nFinal thoughts on the precious Colossal Gems Slot\nI found this slot from Habanero software very playful thanks to its colorful and dynamic graphics. The most original components of this game include the mega-sized symbols (2x2, 3x3, and 4x4). These come into play in both the respin version and the free spin version, both of which prove to be great potential earnings sources. The Gem theme isn't new, and if you like this slot you might want to try some alternatives in our library like the Gems Gems Gems slot from WMS and Sizzling Gems from Novomatic to name just two of the most popular ones. Our free slots are ready to be activated in the browser at any time, using virtually any device, including a mobile phone. You'll find thousands of the best slot titles by clicking right here!\n\nFAQ – Most Frequently Asked Questions about Colossal Gems:\nWhat other Bonus features are there?\nBoth the Respin and Free Spins are equipped with Mega Gems of 2x3, 3x3, and 4x4.\n\nDoes the game have a free spins round?\nYes. Six free spins are awarded after three consecutive respins.\n\nWhat is the maximum bet in Colossal Gems?\nThe maximum total bet is 6000,00€.\n\nWhat is the minimum bet on Colossal Gems?\nThe minimum total bet is 0.30€.\n\nWhat is the biggest win available on Colossal Gems?\nFive purple games pay x1800.\n\nHow volatile are the Colossal Gems?\nThe game is not very volatile – it has low variance.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the giant gems?\nThe game has an RTP of 96.72%.\n            ",
