    "original_text": "\nDim Sum Prize\nUna delle ultime mode in fatto di gastronomia è rappresentata senza ombra di dubbio la cucina orientale, con ristoranti cinesi ormai diventati una valida opzione ogni volta che decidiamo di mangiare fuori. Con il termine Dim Sum si intendono delle pietanze leggere che di solito vengono servite nei tipici piatti di bambù insieme al tè cinese. Tra i piatti tipici troviamo i Sim Mai, piccoli ravioli di carne cotti al vapore, gli Hai Gow a base di gamberi, Bao con pollo e zenzero, involtini primavera, zuppe con spaghetti di soia, e tanti altri piatti tipici di questa tradizione culinaria di successo. Per rendere al meglio la bontà di questo cibo, la Betsoft ha utilizzato una grafica imponente, tanto che ci basta uno sguardo alla slot per sentire l’acquolina alla bocca. I rulli si trovano all0interno di un chiosco cinese, con i simboli sospesi che sembrano galleggiare nell’aria. Nella parte bassa della griglia di gioco troviamo tutti i pulsanti che ci permettono di accedere alle impostazioni e di settare al meglio la nostra scommessa.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nLa griglia di gioco ha un taglio tradizionale con 5 rulli e 3 righe. Le linee di pagamento sono 10 e fisse, con la scommessa minima che va da un minimo di 0,05 € sino a un massimo di 22,50 € per spin. Con Dim Sum Prize è inoltre possibile scegliere un numero di giri automatici compresi tra 5 e 100. Punto forte di questa slot è il valore RTP, pari al 97,18%, laddove di solito consideriamo buono quando raggiunge il 96%.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Dim Sum Prize\nCominciamo subito col dire che in Dim Sum Prize non troverete simboli non tematici come quelli legati al gioco delle carte, ma solo pietanze tipiche cinesi. Si vince quando su una linea di pagamento appaiono almeno 3 simboli identici e adiacenti, a partire da sinistra verso destra. Tra i vari simboli che pagano bene troviamo il Ji baozi, ravioli farciti di pollo, Il Changfen e il Chizi feng zhao, anche se il simbolo che vale di più in assoluto è il Congee, un porridge di riso davvero appetitoso.\nTra i simboli speciali troviamo i biglietti Coupon, se ne appaiono 3 si ha diritto a 5 giri gratuiti. Se simboli Coupon compaiono durante i giri gratuiti, essi si trasformeranno in Teatime Wild, ossia la teiera fumante servita su un vassoio di bambù. tali simboli poi rimarranno fissi sui rulli durante tutti i Free Spins. Ogni volta che apparirà un ulteriore Teatime Wild, si avrà diritto a un giro gratuito aggiuntivo.\nUn altro simbolo speciale è il Bamboo Basket Surprise, un cestino di Bambù che aprendosi rivelerà un Crimson Coupon, un Teatime Wild o Free Spins.\n",

The term Dim Sum refers to light dishes that usually come served in typical bamboo dishes along with Chinese tea. Among the typical dishes, we find Sim Mai, small steamed meat dumplings, Hai Gow made with shrimp, Bao with chicken and ginger, spring rolls, soups with soy noodles, and many other typical dishes of this successful culinary tradition. To best convey the goodness of this food, Betsoft has used impressive graphics, so much so that a glance at the slot is enough to make our mouths water. The reels are located inside a Chinese kiosk, with symbols suspended that seem to float in the air. At the bottom of the game grid we find all the buttons that allow us to access the settings and to set our bet in the best way possible.\n\nMain Features of the Slot Machine\n\nThe game grid has a traditional cut with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 10 and fixed, with the minimum bet ranging from a minimum of €0.05 up to a maximum of €22.50 per spin. With Dim Sum Prize, it is also possible to choose a number of automatic spins between 5 and 100. The strong point of this slot is the RTP value, which is 97.18%, a good number for experienced players, who know that anything above 96% is already a great score.\n\nSymbols and Features of Dim Sum Prize\n\nLet's start by saying that in Dim Sum Prize you won't find non-themed symbols like those related to the game of cards, but only typical Chinese dishes. You win when at least 3 identical and adjacent symbols appear on a payline, starting from left to right. Among the various symbols that pay well, we find Ji baozi, chicken stuffed dumplings, Changfen and Chizi feng zhao, although the symbol that is worth the most is Congee, a truly appetizing rice porridge.\n\nAmong the special symbols, we find the Coupon tickets; if 3 of them appear, you are entitled to 5 free spins. If Coupon symbols appear during the free spins, they will turn into a Teatime Wild, the steaming teapot served on a bamboo tray. These symbols will then remain fixed on the reels during all the free spins. Every time an additional Teatime Wild appears, you are entitled to an additional free spin.\n\nAnother special symbol is the Bamboo Basket Surprise, a bamboo basket that, when opened, reveals a Crimson Coupon, a Teatime Wild or free spins. As an experienced gambler, you know that this is not just a slot game, but a real culinary experience that will make you taste all the delicious flavors of the East!\n            ",

The term Dim Sum refers to light dishes that usually come served in typical bamboo dishes along with Chinese tea. Among the typical dishes, we find Sim Mai, small steamed meat dumplings, Hai Gow made with shrimp, Bao with chicken and ginger, spring rolls, soups with soy noodles, and many other typical dishes of this successful culinary tradition. To best convey the goodness of this food, Betsoft has used impressive graphics, so much so that a glance at the slot is enough to make our mouths water. The reels are located inside a Chinese kiosk, with symbols suspended that seem to float in the air. At the bottom of the game grid we find all the buttons that allow us to access the settings and to set our bet in the best way possible.\n\nMain Features of the Slot Machine\n\nThe game grid has a traditional cut with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 10 and fixed, with the minimum bet ranging from a minimum of €0.05 up to a maximum of €22.50 per spin. With Dim Sum Prize, it is also possible to choose a number of automatic spins between 5 and 100. The strong point of this slot is the RTP value, which is 97.18%, a good number for experienced players, who know that anything above 96% is already a great score.\n\nSymbols and Features of Dim Sum Prize\n\nLet's start by saying that in Dim Sum Prize you won't find non-themed symbols like those related to the game of cards, but only typical Chinese dishes. You win when at least 3 identical and adjacent symbols appear on a payline, starting from left to right. Among the various symbols that pay well, we find Ji baozi, chicken stuffed dumplings, Changfen and Chizi feng zhao, although the symbol that is worth the most is Congee, a truly appetizing rice porridge.\n\nAmong the special symbols, we find the Coupon tickets; if 3 of them appear, you are entitled to 5 free spins. If Coupon symbols appear during the free spins, they will turn into a Teatime Wild, the steaming teapot served on a bamboo tray. These symbols will then remain fixed on the reels during all the free spins. Every time an additional Teatime Wild appears, you are entitled to an additional free spin.\n\nAnother special symbol is the Bamboo Basket Surprise, a bamboo basket that, when opened, reveals a Crimson Coupon, a Teatime Wild or free spins. As an experienced gambler, you know that this is not just a slot game, but a real culinary experience that will make you taste all the delicious flavors of the East!\n            ",

The paylines are 10 and fixed, with the minimum bet ranging from a minimum of €0.05 up to a maximum of €22.50 per spin. With Dim Sum Prize, it is also possible to choose a number of automatic spins between 5 and 100. The strong point of this slot is the RTP value, which is 97.18%, a good number for experienced players, who know that anything above 96% is already a great score.\n\nSymbols and Features of Dim Sum Prize\n\nLet's start by saying that in Dim Sum Prize you won't find non-themed symbols like those related to the game of cards, but only typical Chinese dishes. You win when at least 3 identical and adjacent symbols appear on a payline, starting from left to right. Among the various symbols that pay well, we find Ji baozi, chicken stuffed dumplings, Changfen and Chizi feng zhao, although the symbol that is worth the most is Congee, a truly appetizing rice porridge.\n\nAmong the special symbols, we find the Coupon tickets; if 3 of them appear, you are entitled to 5 free spins. If Coupon symbols appear during the free spins, they will turn into a Teatime Wild, the steaming teapot served on a bamboo tray. These symbols will then remain fixed on the reels during all the free spins. Every time an additional Teatime Wild appears, you are entitled to an additional free spin.\n\nAnother special symbol is the Bamboo Basket Surprise, a bamboo basket that, when opened, reveals a Crimson Coupon, a Teatime Wild or free spins. As an experienced gambler, you know that this is not just a slot game, but a real culinary experience that will make you taste all the delicious flavors of the East!\n            ",

The term Dim Sum refers to light dishes that usually come served in typical bamboo dishes along with Chinese tea. Among the typical dishes, we find Sim Mai, small steamed meat dumplings, Hai Gow made with shrimp, Bao with chicken and ginger, spring rolls, soups with soy noodles, and many other typical dishes of this successful culinary tradition. To best convey the goodness of this food, Betsoft has used impressive graphics, so much so that a glance at the slot is enough to make our mouths water.
