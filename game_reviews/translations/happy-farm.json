Da sempre questa magica formula è considerata come un’accoppiata vincente, proprio come dimostra Happy Farm, uno dei gioiellini del gaming firmati da DreamTech. E’ una giornata fortunata? Scoprilo entrando in contatto con la natura e con la bellezza di questa particolare fattoria. Tra coltivazioni e animali tipici, l’obiettivo primario del giocatore è quello di trovare simboli speciali. Il primo è la Mucca bianca, che rappresenta il Wild, mentre lo Scatter è il cucciolo di Cane. Entri sono stati pensati per aiutarti ad aumentare le possibilità di vittoria. Tutto è pronto per trasformarti in un fortunato agricoltore e conquistare una vincita di alto valore. Scopriamo insieme quali sono i punti di forza di questa slot da 5 rulli e 20 linee di pagamento e soprattutto le funzionalità extra che ci presenta.\nGrafica e Simboli di gioco\nCome si nota appena si entra nel vivo del gioco, lo sfondo è rappresentato in stile cartoon, con una bellissima fattoria immersa nel verde. Al centro si posiziona il nostro tabellone di gioco, organizzato come una bancarella in legno sulla quale non solo si posizionano le verdure raccolte, ma anche i nostri amati amici animali. Tutti i simboli sono unici e chiaramente correlati al tema che ha deciso di approfondire il provider. Abbiamo quindi un Carciofo, Uva, Insalata, Papere, Maiali e Pulcini, con la nostra Lead farmer che ci osserva dalla parte destra dello schermo con il suo smagliante sorriso. Notiamo interessanti effetti visivi in 3D che rendono ancora più piacevole la permanenza del giocatore nel gameplay. Nulla di straordinario, dobbiamo essere sinceri, ma l’effetto finale è sicuramente positivo.\nGiocando ti accorgerai che il Maiale è il simbolo più remunerativo, quello che se viene combinato con altre icone simili potrà portarti a vincere un premio più alto. Come abbiamo detto la Mucca è il nostro Wild, mentre il cane è lo Scatter che permette di attivare la modalità giri gratuiti fino a un numero di sei giri con la possibilità di vincere ovviamente cifre più elevante quando questo bonus game è attivo.\nSe a livello estetico può apparire come un gioco per bambini, passateci il termine, riesce a recuperare la nostra attenzione in termini di gioco. Ci sono diversi motivi che riteniamo molto vantaggiosi per provarla. Prima di tutto permette di controllare completamente i livelli di puntata da fare, a differenza di quanto accade per molte altre slot che trattano lo stesso tema. Le impostazioni del valore della scommessa e quindi delle monete possono essere sempre aggiustate e modificate per scelta del gamer. In questo DreamTech è un ottimo sviluppatore perché sa bene come offrire il massimo dell’intrattenimento e della gestione di gioco per una slot online.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Happy Farm\nLa nostra è quindi una valutazione positiva rispetto alla prova fatta con Happy Farm, ma dobbiamo anche parlare di un altro aspetto che bisogna sempre considerare prima di iniziare a giocare: il suo RTP è al 95,00%.

And Happy Farm, one of the masterpieces from DreamTech gaming, proves just that. Are you feeling lucky? Immerse yourself in nature and the beauty of this special farm. The player's primary objective is to find special symbols among crops and typical animals. The first is the white cow, which represents the Wild, while the Scatter is the puppy dog. Special features have been designed to help increase your chances of winning big. It's time to become a lucky farmer and conquer that high-value jackpot. Let's discover the strengths of this 5-reel, 20-payline slot and the extra features it presents.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nAs soon as you dive into the game, you'll notice that the background is depicted in a cartoon style, with a beautiful farm surrounded by greenery. In the center is the game board, organized like a wooden stand, on which not only are the harvested vegetables placed but also our beloved animal friends. All symbols are unique and clearly related to the theme that the provider has decided to explore. We have an Artichoke, Grapes, Salad, Ducks, Pigs, and chicks, with our Lead farmer watching over from the right side of the screen with her bright smile. Interesting 3D visual effects make the gameplay even more enjoyable. Although nothing extraordinary, the final effect is definitely positive. Playing the game, you'll notice that the pig is the most lucrative symbol, and if combined with other similar icons, it can earn you a higher prize. As we mentioned, the cow is our Wild, and the dog is the Scatter that allows you to activate the free spins mode for up to six spins, with the possibility, of course, to win higher amounts when this bonus game is active.\n\nIf the game appears to be designed for children, it manages to recapture our attention in terms of gameplay. There are several reasons why we think it's advantageous to try it out. First, it allows you to completely control the levels of bets to make compared to many other slots with the same theme. The bet value settings, and therefore the coins, can always be adjusted and modified at the gamer's discretion. In this regard, DreamTech is an excellent developer because it knows how to offer the maximum entertainment and game management for an online slot.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Happy Farm\nOur assessment of Happy Farm is therefore positive, but we also need to consider another aspect before starting to play: its RTP is 95.00%.

For ages this magical formula has been considered a winning combination. And Happy Farm, one of the masterpieces from DreamTech gaming, proves just that. Are you feeling lucky? Immerse yourself in nature and the beauty of this special farm. The player's primary objective is to find special symbols among crops and typical animals. The first is the white cow, which represents the Wild, while the Scatter is the puppy dog. Special features have been designed to help increase your chances of winning big. It's time to become a lucky farmer and conquer that high-value jackpot. Let's discover the strengths of this 5-reel, 20-payline slot and the extra features it presents.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nAs soon as you dive into the game, you'll notice that the background is depicted in a cartoon style, with a beautiful farm surrounded by greenery. In the center is the game board, organized like a wooden stand, on which not only are the harvested vegetables placed but also our beloved animal friends. All symbols are unique and clearly related to the theme that the provider has decided to explore. We have an Artichoke, Grapes, Salad, Ducks, Pigs, and chicks, with our Lead farmer watching over from the right side of the screen with her bright smile. Interesting 3D visual effects make the gameplay even more enjoyable. Although nothing extraordinary, the final effect is definitely positive. Playing the game, you'll notice that the pig is the most lucrative symbol, and if combined with other similar icons, it can earn you a higher prize. As we mentioned, the cow is our Wild, and the dog is the Scatter that allows you to activate the free spins mode for up to six spins, with the possibility, of course, to win higher amounts when this bonus game is active.\n\nIf the game appears to be designed for children, it manages to recapture our attention in terms of gameplay. There are several reasons why we think it's advantageous to try it out. First, it allows you to completely control the levels of bets to make compared to many other slots with the same theme. The bet value settings, and therefore the coins, can always be adjusted and modified at the gamer's discretion. In this regard, DreamTech is an excellent developer because it knows how to offer the maximum entertainment and game management for an online slot.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Happy Farm\nOur assessment of Happy Farm is therefore positive, but we also need to consider another aspect before starting to play: its RTP is 95.00%. Happy Farm can be played on any mobile device, so you can always find an alternative solution to your computer.\n            ",

The game features special symbols including the white cow, which represents the Wild, and the puppy dog, which is the Scatter. There are also special features designed to help players increase their chances of winning big.\n\nGraphic Design and Theme\n\nThe game features a cartoon-style farm surrounded by greenery, with a wooden game board in the center featuring harvested vegetables and animals. The symbols in the game are unique and relevant to the farm theme, such as Artichoke, Grapes, Salad, Ducks, Pigs, chicks, and our Lead farmer. The 3D visual effects make the gameplay more enjoyable, but overall, the design is not unique.\n\nBet Value Settings\n\nOne of the advantages of Happy Farm is that it allows players to completely control the levels of bets compared to many other slots with a similar theme. The bet value settings and coins can always be adjusted and modified at the gamer's discretion, making it an excellent option for those who want to play with smaller or bigger bets.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP)\n\nHappy Farm has an RTP of 95.00%, which is average for online slots. However, players should be aware of this before they start playing. It's important to keep in mind that the RTP represents the theoretical payout percentage over the long term, and individual games may have significant deviations in their actual payout percentages.\n\nCompatibility with Mobile Devices\n\nHappy Farm can be played on any mobile device, making it a versatile and convenient option for those who want to play on the go. The mobile version of the game has the same features and gameplay as the desktop version, with no significant differences.\n\n        \n            ",

For ages this magical formula has been considered a winning combination. And Happy Farm, one of the masterpieces from DreamTech gaming, proves just that. Are you feeling lucky? Immerse yourself in nature and the beauty of this special farm. The player's primary objective is to find special symbols among crops and typical animals. The first is the white cow, which represents the Wild, while the Scatter is the puppy dog. Special features have been designed to help increase your chances of winning big. It's time to become a lucky farmer and conquer that high-value jackpot. Let's discover the strengths of this 5-reel, 20-payline slot and the extra features it presents.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nAs soon as you dive into the game, you'll notice that the background is depicted in a cartoon style, with a beautiful farm surrounded by greenery. In the center is the game board, organized like a wooden stand, on which not only are the harvested vegetables placed but also our beloved animal friends. All symbols are unique and clearly related to the theme that the provider has decided to explore. We have an Artichoke, Grapes, Salad, Ducks, Pigs, and chicks, with our Lead farmer watching over from the right side of the screen with her bright smile. Interesting 3D visual effects make the gameplay even more enjoyable. Although nothing extraordinary, the final effect is definitely positive. Playing the game, you'll notice that the pig is the most lucrative symbol, and if combined with other similar icons, it can earn you a higher prize. As we mentioned, the cow is our Wild, and the dog is the Scatter that allows you to activate the free spins mode for up to six spins, with the possibility, of course, to win higher amounts when this bonus game is active.\n\nIf the game appears to be designed for children, it manages to recapture our attention in terms of gameplay. There are several reasons why we think it's advantageous to try it out. First, it allows you to completely control the levels of bets to make compared to many other slots with the same theme. The bet value settings, and therefore the coins, can always be adjusted and modified at the gamer's discretion. In this regard, DreamTech is an excellent developer because it knows how to offer the maximum entertainment and game management for an online slot.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Happy Farm\nOur assessment of Happy Farm is therefore positive, but we also need to consider another aspect before starting to play: its RTP is 95.00%. Happy Farm can be played on any mobile device, so you can always find an alternative solution to your computer.\n            ",
