            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Action Dragons\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nAction Dragons\n\nExperience the thrill of this exciting Ainsworth slot game with its Asian-inspired theme. With three rows and five reels spinning on 30 always-active paylines, this game boasts a medium variance and theoretical return to player of 96.57%. The dynamic gameplay lends itself well to the pacing and potential maximum 1500x payout on a winning bet.\n\nClassic symbols such as the lucky fish, vases, and gold coins appear on the five reels and 30 paylines, making for a similar style to many other popular slot games. However, Action Dragons online slot offers unique bonuses to keep things interesting.\n\nA wild dragon appears to help complete winning combinations, and there's a free spin round that makes it easier to collect high-value prizes. Additionally, there's a special bonus within the bonus where Lucky Multiplier Spins increase rewards by up to 5x. You could win up to 1500x your bet through this feature alone.\n\nGraphics for Dragon Enthusiasts\n\nAustralians Ainsworth Gaming Technology specializes in online slot games with Asian themes, and Action Dragons is no exception. The stylized reels draw inspiration from Chinese culture, featuring items such as gold coins, the yin and yang symbol, a ribbon-bound gold coin, and a fiery sphere representing the sun.\n\nThe game's background features a striking jade color and modern Chinese music. While not fundamentally different from other slot games, Action Dragons is a visually impressive spectacle on both desktop and mobile platforms.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nAinsworth has revamped the layout of the buttons and control settings, making each aspect more intuitive than ever before. Starting is easy and bets can range from a steep €1,00 per spin with a maximum of €48,00. The high minimum bet limit speaks to the game's potential payout.\n\nFor a more relaxed gaming experience, players can activate the autoplay mode while a series of additional, optional settings let you control your balance expenditure. The Max button allows you to place the highest bet with one simple click, and the paytable is accessible via the menu button in the bottom left corner.\n\nThe wild symbol is the extra feature of the game and it expands across the entire reel, appearing on multiple reels simultaneously. Three scatters trigger 10 free spins, during which the wild dragon appears in the middle of three reels and the green scatter appears on reels one and five, but only during the bonus.\n\nThe green door symbol triggers three Lucky Multiplier Bonus Spins. Multipliers of 2x, 3x, and 5x can appear on reels three and act as wild symbols. Perhaps this explains why payouts during the bonus round are lower than base gameplay, but the guaranteed multipliers make up for it.\n\nTo win, you need at least three matching symbols on any of the 30 paylines, with optimal wins coming from five matching symbols.  Wild symbols can substitute for any other symbol except for the scatter and bonus symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nKonami's Ancient Dragon is a famous slot game with an alternative reel layout that offers no fewer than 100 paylines. This game draws inspiration from ancient Chinese culture and features a precious symbol that provides a 2x multiplier and 300x prize when it lands in five cases.\n\nExperience the thrill of Action Dragons and try your luck at this exciting game with its potential for high payouts and unique bonuses.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame Description\nSpecial Bonuses\nGameplay Features\nGraphics and Sound\nPayouts and Variance\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Action Dragons\n\nExperience the thrill of this exciting Ainsworth slot game with its Asian-inspired theme. With three rows and five reels spinning on 30 always-active paylines, this game boasts a medium variance and theoretical return to player of 96.57%. The dynamic gameplay lends itself well to the pacing and potential maximum 1500x payout on a winning bet.\n\nClassic symbols such as the lucky fish, vases, and gold coins appear on the five reels and 30 paylines, making for a similar style to many other popular slot games. However, Action Dragons online slot offers unique bonuses to keep things interesting.\n\nA wild dragon appears to help complete winning combinations, and there's a free spin round that makes it easier to collect high-value prizes. Additionally, there's a special bonus within the bonus where Lucky Multiplier Spins increase rewards by up to 5x. You could win up to 1500x your bet through this feature alone.\n\nGraphics for Dragon Enthusiasts\n\nAustralians Ainsworth Gaming Technology specializes in online slot games with Asian themes, and Action Dragons is no exception. The stylized reels draw inspiration from Chinese culture, featuring items such as gold coins, the yin and yang symbol, a ribbon-bound gold coin, and a fiery sphere representing the sun.\n\nThe game's background features a striking jade color and modern Chinese music. While not fundamentally different from other slot games, Action Dragons is a visually impressive spectacle on both desktop and mobile platforms.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nAinsworth has revamped the layout of the buttons and control settings, making each aspect more intuitive than ever before. Starting is easy and bets can range from a steep €1,00 per spin with a maximum of €48,00. The high minimum bet limit speaks to the game's potential payout.\n\nFor a more relaxed gaming experience, players can activate the autoplay mode while a series of additional, optional settings let you control your balance expenditure. The Max button allows you to place the highest bet with one simple click, and the paytable is accessible via the menu button in the bottom left corner.\n\nThe wild symbol is the extra feature of the game and it expands across the entire reel, appearing on multiple reels simultaneously. Three scatters trigger 10 free spins, during which the wild dragon appears in the middle of three reels and the green scatter appears on reels one and five, but only during the bonus.\n\nThe green door symbol triggers three Lucky Multiplier Bonus Spins. Multipliers of 2x, 3x, and 5x can appear on reels three and act as wild symbols. Perhaps this explains why payouts during the bonus round are lower than base gameplay, but the guaranteed multipliers make up for it.\n\nTo win, you need at least three matching symbols on any of the 30 paylines, with optimal wins coming from five matching symbols.  Wild symbols can substitute for any other symbol except for the scatter and bonus symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nKonami's Ancient Dragon is a famous slot game with an alternative reel layout that offers no fewer than 100 paylines. This game draws inspiration from ancient Chinese culture and features a precious symbol that provides a 2x multiplier and 300x prize when it lands in five cases.\n\nExperience the thrill of Action Dragons and try your luck at this exciting game with its potential for high payouts and unique bonuses.\n            ",

The theoretical return to player is 96.57%, and players have the potential to win a maximum payout of 1500x on a winning bet. The game has classic symbols such as the lucky fish, vases, and gold coins on the reels, making it similar to many other popular slot games. However, it also offers unique bonuses such as a wild dragon to help complete winning combinations, a free spin round that makes it easier to collect high-value prizes, and a special bonus within the bonus where Lucky Multiplier Spins increase rewards by up to 5x.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nThe graphics in Action Dragons are visually impressive and draw inspiration from Chinese culture. The stylized reels feature gold coins, the yin and yang symbol, a ribbon-bound gold coin, and a fiery sphere representing the sun. The background is a striking jade color, and the Chinese music adds to the immersion. While it doesn't differ fundamentally from other slot games, it stands out as a spectacle on both desktop and mobile platforms.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nTo win, players need at least three matching symbols on any of the 30 paylines, with optimal wins coming from five matching symbols. Wild symbols can substitute for any other symbol except for the scatter and bonus symbols. Classic symbols like lucky fish, vases, and gold coins are present on the reels, and a wild dragon symbol appears to help complete winning combinations. Scatter symbols trigger ten free spins, during which the wild dragon appears in the middle of three reels, and a green scatter appears on reels one and five, but only during the bonus. Green door symbols trigger three Lucky Multiplier Bonus Spins, with multipliers of up to 5x visible in the middle row of the third reel.\n\nBonuses and Payouts\n\nAction Dragons online slot offers unique bonuses that keep things interesting. The game has a free spin round that makes it easier to collect high-value prizes and a special bonus within the bonus where Lucky Multiplier Spins increase rewards by up to 5x. The game's maximum payout is 1500x on a winning bet, and players can activate the autoplay mode to enjoy a more relaxed gaming experience. The high minimum bet limit of €1,00 speaks to the game's potential payout. Additionally, the wild dragon symbol can expand across the entire reel, appearing on multiple reels simultaneously.\n\nCompatibility and Accessibility\n\nAction Dragons works on both desktop and mobile platforms, making it accessible to a wide range of players. Ainsworth has revamped the layout of the buttons and control settings, making it easy for players to start and control bets ranging from a maximum of €48,00. The Max button allows for the highest bet to be placed with one simple click, and the paytable is accessible via the menu button in the bottom left.\n\n        \n            ",

The stylized reels draw inspiration from Chinese culture, featuring items such as gold coins, the yin and yang symbol, a ribbon-bound gold coin, and a fiery sphere representing the sun.\n\nThe game's background features a striking jade color and modern Chinese music. While not fundamentally different from other slot games, Action Dragons is a visually impressive spectacle on both desktop and mobile platforms.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nAinsworth has revamped the layout of the buttons and control settings, making each aspect more intuitive than ever before. Starting is easy and bets can range from a steep €1,00 per spin with a maximum of €48,00. The high minimum bet limit speaks to the game's potential payout.\n\nFor a more relaxed gaming experience, players can activate the autoplay mode while a series of additional, optional settings let you control your balance expenditure. The Max button allows you to place the highest bet with one simple click, and the paytable is accessible via the menu button in the bottom left corner.\n\nThe wild symbol is the extra feature of the game and it expands across the entire reel, appearing on multiple reels simultaneously. Three scatters trigger 10 free spins, during which the wild dragon appears in the middle of three reels and the green scatter appears on reels one and five, but only during the bonus.\n\nThe green door symbol triggers three Lucky Multiplier Bonus Spins. Multipliers of 2x, 3x, and 5x can appear on reels three and act as wild symbols. Perhaps this explains why payouts during the bonus round are lower than base gameplay, but the guaranteed multipliers make up for it.\n\nTo win, you need at least three matching symbols on any of the 30 paylines, with optimal wins coming from five matching symbols.  Wild symbols can substitute for any other symbol except for the scatter and bonus symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nKonami's Ancient Dragon is a famous slot game with an alternative reel layout that offers no fewer than 100 paylines. This game draws inspiration from ancient Chinese culture and features a precious symbol that provides a 2x multiplier and 300x prize when it lands in five cases.\n\nExperience the thrill of Action Dragons and try your luck at this exciting game with its potential for high payouts and unique bonuses.\n            ",
