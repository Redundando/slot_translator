In 1988 a movie was released that would become a real cult classic among teenagers in the 80s. For those who haven't seen the film, the story is simple: the couple Adam and Barbara die in an accident and return home as ghosts. When the Deetz couple buys their house, Adam and Barbara decide to scare them away, but they are unable to, so they have no choice but to call on Beetlejuice, an exorcist who drives away the living instead of the dead.\n\nThe initial screen opens with the main characters of the story: Beetlejuice in the center with his white and black striped suit, hair blowing in the wind and makeup around his eyes. Behind him are Adam and Barbara in their wedding attire. The detailed graphics and colorful visuals make this slot visually very pleasing for an interesting and engaging gaming experience.\n\nMain features of the slot\n\nThe Barcrest slot uses the Megaways gaming system that varies the ways to win from 32 up to 288,832 with a minimum bet of just ten cents! The slot's volatility is variable, while the theoretical return to player is 96%. Among the various features, there is an option to accelerate the reel rotation and one to set a betting and loss limit.\n\nThe five reels use a cascading mechanism: after each win, all symbols are swept away and replaced by others that fall from a shadowed area at the top of the screen. The rows can reach a maximum of twelve. This slot is not suitable for beginners, but it is suitable for an experienced player. To not lose the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Megaways gaming system for free, there is a demo version to practice before betting real money.\n\nSymbols and features of Beetlejuice Megaways\n\nThis slot offers both non-themed and themed symbols. The non-themed symbols are the numbers and letters of the playing cards, from ten to ace, with a lower value. Among the themed symbols, we find the film's characters: in addition to Beetlejuice, we have Shrunken Head, Miss Argentina, Serpent and Lydia. The Beetlejuice sign represents the Scatter that activates the free spins. Depending on the number of symbols that appear in any position on the reels, you can get 8, 12 or 16.\n\nBeetlejuice also pays out if it appears only twice, while for all other symbols, an alignment of at least three icons is necessary.\n\nFrom time to time on the screen, the ghost symbol may appear, activating the mysterious symbol feature, after which all ghosts transform into the same symbol. Although this does not automatically lead to a winning combination, there is no need to worry; in this case, you can get another cascade of symbols and new opportunities to win.",

In 1988 a movie was released that would become a real cult classic among teenagers in the 80s. For those who haven't seen the film, the story is simple: the couple Adam and Barbara die in an accident and return home as ghosts. When the Deetz couple buys their house, Adam and Barbara decide to scare them away, but they are unable to, so they have no choice but to call on Beetlejuice, an exorcist who drives away the living instead of the dead.\n\nThe initial screen opens with the main characters of the story: Beetlejuice in the center with his white and black striped suit, hair blowing in the wind and makeup around his eyes. Behind him are Adam and Barbara in their wedding attire. The detailed graphics and colorful visuals make this slot visually very pleasing for an interesting and engaging gaming experience.\n\nMain features of the slot\n\nThe Barcrest slot uses the Megaways gaming system that varies the ways to win from 32 up to 288,832 with a minimum bet of just ten cents! The slot's volatility is variable, while the theoretical return to player is 96%. Among the various features, there is an option to accelerate the reel rotation and one to set a betting and loss limit.\n\nThe five reels use a cascading mechanism: after each win, all symbols are swept away and replaced by others that fall from a shadowed area at the top of the screen. The rows can reach a maximum of twelve. This slot is not suitable for beginners, but it is suitable for an experienced player. To not lose the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Megaways gaming system for free, there is a demo version to practice before betting real money.\n\nSymbols and features of Beetlejuice Megaways\n\nThis slot offers both non-themed and themed symbols. The non-themed symbols are the numbers and letters of the playing cards, from ten to ace, with a lower value. Among the themed symbols, we find the film's characters: in addition to Beetlejuice, we have Shrunken Head, Miss Argentina, Serpent and Lydia. The Beetlejuice sign represents the Scatter that activates the free spins. Depending on the number of symbols that appear in any position on the reels, you can get 8, 12 or 16.\n\nBeetlejuice also pays out if it appears only twice, while for all other symbols, an alignment of at least three icons is necessary.\n\nFrom time to time on the screen, the ghost symbol may appear, activating the mysterious symbol feature, after which all ghosts transform into the same symbol. Although this does not automatically lead to a winning combination, there is no need to worry; in this case, you can get another cascade of symbols and new opportunities to win.\n            ",

The five reels use a cascading mechanism that allows the rows to reach a maximum of twelve.\n\nReturn to player\n\nThe slot's volatility is variable, while the theoretical return to player is 96%.\n\nFree spins\n\nThe Beetlejuice sign represents the Scatter that activates the free spins. Depending on the number of symbols that appear in any position on the reels, players can get 8, 12 or 16 free spins.\n\nThemed symbols\n\nThis slot offers both non-themed and themed symbols. Among the themed symbols, we find the film's characters: in addition to Beetlejuice, we have Shrunken Head, Miss Argentina, Serpent and Lydia. The non-themed symbols are the numbers and letters of the playing cards, with a lower value.\n\nGhost symbol feature\n\nFrom time to time on the screen, the ghost symbol may appear, activating the mysterious symbol feature, after which all ghosts transform into the same symbol. Although this does not automatically lead to a winning combination, there is no need to worry; in this case, players can get another cascade of symbols and new opportunities to win.\n\n        \n            ",

In 1988 a movie was released that would become a real cult classic among teenagers in the 80s. For those who haven't seen the film, the story is simple: the couple Adam and Barbara die in an accident and return home as ghosts. When the Deetz couple buys their house, Adam and Barbara decide to scare them away, but they are unable to, so they have no choice but to call on Beetlejuice, an exorcist who drives away the living instead of the dead.\n\nThe initial screen opens with the main characters of the story: Beetlejuice in the center with his white and black striped suit, hair blowing in the wind and makeup around his eyes. Behind him are Adam and Barbara in their wedding attire. The detailed graphics and colorful visuals make this slot visually very pleasing for an interesting and engaging gaming experience.\n\nMain features of the slot\n\nThe Barcrest slot uses the Megaways gaming system that varies the ways to win from 32 up to 288,832 with a minimum bet of just ten cents! The slot's volatility is variable, while the theoretical return to player is 96%. Among the various features, there is an option to accelerate the reel rotation and one to set a betting and loss limit.\n\nThe five reels use a cascading mechanism: after each win, all symbols are swept away and replaced by others that fall from a shadowed area at the top of the screen. The rows can reach a maximum of twelve. This slot is not suitable for beginners, but it is suitable for an experienced player. To not lose the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Megaways gaming system for free, there is a demo version to practice before betting real money.\n\nSymbols and features of Beetlejuice Megaways\n\nThis slot offers both non-themed and themed symbols. The non-themed symbols are the numbers and letters of the playing cards, from ten to ace, with a lower value. Among the themed symbols, we find the film's characters: in addition to Beetlejuice, we have Shrunken Head, Miss Argentina, Serpent and Lydia. The Beetlejuice sign represents the Scatter that activates the free spins. Depending on the number of symbols that appear in any position on the reels, you can get 8, 12 or 16.\n\nBeetlejuice also pays out if it appears only twice, while for all other symbols, an alignment of at least three icons is necessary.\n\nFrom time to time on the screen, the ghost symbol may appear, activating the mysterious symbol feature, after which all ghosts transform into the same symbol. Although this does not automatically lead to a winning combination, there is no need to worry; in this case, you can get another cascade of symbols and new opportunities to win.\n            ",

In 1988 a movie was released that would become a real cult classic among teenagers in the 80s. For those who haven't seen the film, the story is simple: the couple Adam and Barbara die in an accident and return home as ghosts. When the Deetz couple buys their house, Adam and Barbara decide to scare them away, but they are unable to, so they have no choice but to call on Beetlejuice, an exorcist who drives away the living instead of the dead.\n\nThe initial screen opens with the main characters of the story: Beetlejuice in the center with his white and black striped suit, hair blowing in the wind and makeup around his eyes. Behind him are Adam and Barbara in their wedding attire. The detailed graphics and colorful visuals make this slot visually very pleasing for an interesting and engaging gaming experience.\n\nMain features of the slot\n\nThe Barcrest slot uses the Megaways gaming system that varies the ways to win from 32 up to 288,832 with a minimum bet of just ten cents! The slot's volatility is variable, while the theoretical return to player is 96%. Among the various features, there is an option to accelerate the reel rotation and one to set a betting and loss limit.\n\nThe five reels use a cascading mechanism: after each win, all symbols are swept away and replaced by others that fall from a shadowed area at the top of the screen. The rows can reach a maximum of twelve. This slot is not suitable for beginners, but it is suitable for an experienced player. To not lose the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Megaways gaming system for free, there is a demo version to practice before betting real money.\n\nSymbols and features of Beetlejuice Megaways\n\nThis slot offers both non-themed and themed symbols. The non-themed symbols are the numbers and letters of the playing cards, from ten to ace, with a lower value. Among the themed symbols, we find the film's characters: in addition to Beetlejuice, we have Shrunken Head, Miss Argentina, Serpent and Lydia. The Beetlejuice sign represents the Scatter that activates the free spins. Depending on the number of symbols that appear in any position on the reels, you can get 8, 12 or 16.\n\nBeetlejuice also pays out if it appears only twice, while for all other symbols, an alignment of at least three icons is necessary.\n\nFrom time to time on the screen, the ghost symbol may appear, activating the mysterious symbol feature, after which all ghosts transform into the same symbol. Although this does not automatically lead to a winning combination, there is no need to worry; in this case, you can get another cascade of symbols and new opportunities to win.\n        ",
