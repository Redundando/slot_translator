Sicuramente dando una prima occhiata distratta a questo nuovo prodotto di casa Skywind il dubbio è da considerarsi più che legittimo!\nIl tema è quello dei combattimenti epici tra cavalieri senza macchina e senza paura, con il contorno di personaggi tipici quali l’immancabile mago, la bellissima ma pericolosissima dama, una serie di mostri e un’ambientazione davvero affascinante!\nNon aspettatevi però un gioco dall’atmosfera medioevale, perché il tutto è realizzato in chiave moderna, a partire dalla grafica in stile cartone animato e dalla scelta dei colori.\nCombat Masters ci accoglie con una schermata iniziale che già ci fa intuire il tema del gioco: il cavaliere e la perfida, splendida Aleada occupano gran parte dello schermo, con uno sfondo scintillante nelle tonalità del blu e del viola.\nPer quanto riguarda invece la schermata di gioco, sembra davvero di trovarsi dentro un videogame, con la parte superiore che mostra i duellanti e quella inferiore in cui sono posizionati i rulli. Ai lati troviamo invece le impostazioni del gioco, incluso il tasto di spin, quelli per stabilire il valore della scommessa e quello per l’Autoplay.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nCombat Masters è una slot machine davvero interessante e, sebbene la Skywind non rientri nel novero dei provider più blasonati, si distingue comunque per prodotti interessanti e di indubbia qualità.\nIniziamo dalla griglia che è composta da 7 rulli per cinque righe, con un sistema di gioco che prevede la caduta dei simboli a cascata.\nIn Combat Masters sono previsti ben otto livelli diversi di gioco, in cui si può provare a vincere fino a 1.000 volte il valore della puntata. Si gioca con 100 gettoni fissi, che hanno un valore compreso tra un centesimo e 2 €, il che significa che la puntata minima è di 1 € mentre quella massima arriva a 200 €, una cifra di una certa importanza!\nSi tratta di un gioco caratterizzato inoltre da una volatilità media, per cui i premi importanti potrebbero farsi aspettare e vi occorrerà un buona dose di pazienza! Per quanto riguarda poi il ritorno teorico al giocatore o RTP, in Combat Masters si attesta su un 96,06%, nella media.\nGameplay e funzionalità di Combat Masters\nIl meccanismo di pagamento in Combat Masters è detto “a cluster” e significa che si vince quando sui rulli cascano cinque o più simboli identici in senso orizzontale, verticale o in blocchi. Più grande è il cluster, più valore avrà la vincita.\nLe funzionalità speciali di Combat Masters includono delle funzioni cosiddette di potenziamento del gameplay, che porta a salire al livello di gioco successivo, e la finzione Wild Power, con Wild extra che appaiono sui rulli quando si ottengono dei cluster di almeno 16 simboli.\n",

However, don't expect a medieval atmosphere as everything is presented in a modern key, starting from the cartoon-style graphics and color selection.\n\nRegarding the game screen, it truly feels like being inside a video game, with the upper part showing the dueling characters and the lower part displaying the reels.

At first glance, the question is more than legitimate when considering this new product from Skywind. The theme is that of epic battles between fearless knights, devoid of machines, and featuring typical characters such as the inevitable wizard, the beautiful but dangerous lady, a series of monsters, and a truly fascinating environment!\n\nCombat Masters welcomes us with an initial screen that already hints at the game's theme: the knight and the perfidious, splendid Aleada, occupy a large part of the screen, with a sparkling background in shades of blue and purple. However, don't expect a medieval atmosphere as everything is presented in a modern key, starting from the cartoon-style graphics and color selection.\n\nRegarding the game screen, it truly feels like being inside a video game, with the upper part showing the dueling characters and the lower part displaying the reels. On both sides, we find the game settings, including the spin button, those to set the bet value, and that for Autoplay.\n\nKey features of the slot machine\nCombat Masters is a genuinely interesting slot machine. Although Skywind is not among the most renowned providers, it stands out for its interesting and undoubted quality products. Let's start with the grid consisting of 7 reels for five rows, with a gameplay system that provides for the cascade fall of symbols.\n\nCombat Masters features eight different game levels, in which you can win up to 1,000 times the bet value. The game is played with 100 fixed coins, with a value ranging from one cent to 2 €, which means that the minimum bet is 1 € while the maximum one reaches 200 €, a considerable amount!\n\nFurthermore, it is a game characterized by medium volatility; thus, significant awards might take some time, and you will need a good deal of patience. As for the theoretical return to the player or RTP, it stands at 96.06%.\n\nGameplay and functionality of Combat Masters\nThe payment mechanism in Combat Masters is called \"cluster,\" which means that you win when five or more identical symbols fall on the reels horizontally, vertically, or in blocks. The larger the cluster, the more valuable the win.\n\nCombat Masters' special features include gameplay-enhancing functions that lead to moving up to the next game level, and the Wild Power feature, with extra Wilds appearing on the reels when at least 16 symbols cluster. \n\nIn short, Combat Masters is an engaging slot game with an interesting gameplay mechanism and valuable features that can provide hours of fun and excitement.\n        ",
