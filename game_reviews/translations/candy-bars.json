Candy Bars is a 4-reel slot game that rewards up to 100x your bet. Coming from the portfolio of IGT, the game has 50 paylines even though it only has four reels and four rows.\n\nA Colorful Graphics\nDespite being released at the end of 2013, Free Candy Bars slot game has a classic slot feel with only a handful of symbols present on the paytable. You should be warned before looking at it that your stomach may start rumbling as the chances of drooling are favorable! \nGumballs are the Wild symbols on these sugar-loaded reels and can replace all other symbols, but you will only see them appear on the second and third reels. Every time one of them is part of a win, its value will be doubled, while wins involving two of them will quadruple the payout.\nThe classic feel I referred to comes from the inclusion of 7s as the two highest-paying symbols, each with a red and blue color scheme. Red 7s with a blue background are worth the most, as they will pay up to 100 coins, while blue 7s with a red background will pay up to 50 coins. However, you can also mix these symbols with any four to win 10 coins and any three to win 5 coins. The three candies are full of personality, each one designed as a character. Four of lollipops, peppermints, or candy will earn you 10 coins, while three matching ones will earn you 5 coins that will make you crave more.\n\nFunctions and symbols of Slot Machine\nThe game benefits from Wild Multipliers depicted as a gumball with 2x on it. It lands on reels 2 and 3 only to replace all other symbols and double the payouts of combos it is included in. If you complete your win with 2 Wilds, your payout will be quadrupled.\nCovering all reels entirely with symbols of one kind will get you a Blackout Win that can pay between 5,000 and 25,000 coins. This applies only to winning combinations without Wilds included.\nThe biggest attraction of the Candy Bars slot is three progressive jackpots, which are displayed above the reels. You can hit the Snack Size, King Size, or Giant Size progressive jackpot. To win them, you must land respectively two, three or four stacks of symbols with a chocolate background on the reels. So, by landing a stack of symbols with the background of a chocolate bar on reels 2, you will get a Snack Size jackpot. A King Size progressive jackpot will be yours if you put chocolate bars on reels 2 and 3, while chocolate bars hitting reels 2, 3 and 4 guarantee a Giant Size progressive jackpot.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nCandy Bars is certainly a Slot Machine that wants to resume the most traditional patterns, when everything was simpler, and winnings more frequent. If you want to continue with Slot Machines of the same vein, we can suggest Bubble Craze, also produced by IGT. Thanks to its multipliers, it allows you to win up to €1,000 with a single spin!\n            ",

It has a colorful graphics style with a classic slot feel. The highest-paying symbols in the game are two different colored 7s.\n\nGumball Wilds\n\nGumballs are the Wild symbols on the reels and can replace all other symbols except for the Blackout Win. They appear exclusively on the second and third reels and double the value of any win that they are part of. Wins that involve two Gumball Wilds will quadruple the payout.\n\nWild Multipliers\n\nThe Wild Multipliers are represented by a Gumball with a 2x value on it. They show up on reels 2 and 3 only to replace all symbols and double the payout of the winning combination that they are included in. If your win includes two of these symbols, your payout will be quadrupled.\n\nProgressive Jackpot\n\nThere are three progressive jackpots available in Candy Bars: the Snack Size, King Size, and Giant Size. To win one of these jackpots, you must land 2, 3, or 4 stacks of symbols with a chocolate background on the reels. A Snack Size jackpot is won by landing a stack of symbols with the background of a chocolate bar on reels 2, a King Size progressive jackpot will be yours if you put chocolate bars on reels 2 and 3, while chocolate bars hitting reels 2, 3 and 4 guarantee a Giant Size progressive jackpot.\n\nWinning Opportunities\n\nCovering the reels entirely with symbols of one kind will get you a Blackout Win that can payout between 5,000 and 25,000 coins. The game has few symbols making winning combinations landing more frequently.  The highest payout of 100 coins is won by landing 3 Red 7 with a Blue background symbols, while a Blue 7 with a Red background symbol will pay out up to 50 coins. Four of the lollipops, peppermints, or candy symbols will earn you 10 coins, while three matching ones will earn you 5 coins.\n\n        \n            ",

Candy Bars is a 4-reel slot game that rewards up to 100x your bet. Coming from the portfolio of IGT, the game has 50 paylines even though it only has four reels and four rows.\n\nA Colorful Graphics\nDespite being released at the end of 2013, Free Candy Bars slot game has a classic slot feel with only a handful of symbols present on the paytable. You should be warned before looking at it that your stomach may start rumbling as the chances of drooling are favorable! \nGumballs are the Wild symbols on these sugar-loaded reels and can replace all other symbols, but you will only see them appear on the second and third reels. Every time one of them is part of a win, its value will be doubled, while wins involving two of them will quadruple the payout.\nThe classic feel I referred to comes from the inclusion of 7s as the two highest-paying symbols, each with a red and blue color scheme. Red 7s with a blue background are worth the most, as they will pay up to 100 coins, while blue 7s with a red background will pay up to 50 coins. However, you can also mix these symbols with any four to win 10 coins and any three to win 5 coins. The three candies are full of personality, each one designed as a character. Four of lollipops, peppermints, or candy will earn you 10 coins, while three matching ones will earn you 5 coins that will make you crave more.\n\nFunctions and symbols of Slot Machine\nThe game benefits from Wild Multipliers depicted as a gumball with 2x on it. It lands on reels 2 and 3 only to replace all other symbols and double the payouts of combos it is included in. If you complete your win with 2 Wilds, your payout will be quadrupled.\nCovering all reels entirely with symbols of one kind will get you a Blackout Win that can pay between 5,000 and 25,000 coins. This applies only to winning combinations without Wilds included.\nThe biggest attraction of the Candy Bars slot is three progressive jackpots, which are displayed above the reels. You can hit the Snack Size, King Size, or Giant Size progressive jackpot. To win them, you must land respectively two, three or four stacks of symbols with a chocolate background on the reels. So, by landing a stack of symbols with the background of a chocolate bar on reels 2, you will get a Snack Size jackpot. A King Size progressive jackpot will be yours if you put chocolate bars on reels 2 and 3, while chocolate bars hitting reels 2, 3 and 4 guarantee a Giant Size progressive jackpot.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nCandy Bars is certainly a Slot Machine that wants to resume the most traditional patterns, when everything was simpler, and winnings more frequent. If you want to continue with Slot Machines of the same vein, we can suggest Bubble Craze, also produced by IGT. Thanks to its multipliers, it allows you to win up to €1,000 with a single spin!\n            ",

Candy Bars is a 4-reel slot game that rewards up to 100x your bet. Coming from the portfolio of IGT, the game has 50 paylines even though it only has four reels and four rows.\n\nA Colorful Graphics\nDespite being released at the end of 2013, Free Candy Bars slot game has a classic slot feel with only a handful of symbols present on the paytable. You should be warned before looking at it that your stomach may start rumbling as the chances of drooling are favorable! \nGumballs are the Wild symbols on these sugar-loaded reels and can replace all other symbols, but you will only see them appear on the second and third reels. Every time one of them is part of a win, its value will be doubled, while wins involving two of them will quadruple the payout.\nThe classic feel I referred to comes from the inclusion of 7s as the two highest-paying symbols, each with a red and blue color scheme. Red 7s with a blue background are worth the most, as they will pay up to 100 coins, while blue 7s with a red background will pay up to 50 coins. However, you can also mix these symbols with any four to win 10 coins and any three to win 5 coins. The three candies are full of personality, each one designed as a character. Four of lollipops, peppermints, or candy will earn you 10 coins, while three matching ones will earn you 5 coins that will make you crave more.\n\nFunctions and symbols of Slot Machine\nThe game benefits from Wild Multipliers depicted as a gumball with 2x on it. It lands on reels 2 and 3 only to replace all other symbols and double the payouts of combos it is included in. If you complete your win with 2 Wilds, your payout will be quadrupled.\nCovering all reels entirely with symbols of one kind will get you a Blackout Win that can pay between 5,000 and 25,000 coins. This applies only to winning combinations without Wilds included.\nThe biggest attraction of the Candy Bars slot is three progressive jackpots, which are displayed above the reels. You can hit the Snack Size, King Size, or Giant Size progressive jackpot. To win them, you must land respectively two, three or four stacks of symbols with a chocolate background on the reels. So, by landing a stack of symbols with the background of a chocolate bar on reels 2, you will get a Snack Size jackpot. A King Size progressive jackpot will be yours if you put chocolate bars on reels 2 and 3, while chocolate bars hitting reels 2, 3 and 4 guarantee a Giant Size progressive jackpot.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nCandy Bars is certainly a Slot Machine that wants to resume the most traditional patterns, when everything was simpler, and winnings more frequent. If you want to continue with Slot Machines of the same vein, we can suggest Bubble Craze, also produced by IGT. Thanks to its multipliers, it allows you to win up to €1,000 with a single spin!\n            ",
