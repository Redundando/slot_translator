The dark magic of Voodoo has arrived in Europe after previously taking Australia by storm. This slot game, created by Lightning Box, a subsidiary of Light & Wonder, is based on the theme of Voodoo, though don't expect dark and scary places, blood or human sacrifices. Instead, the atmosphere is quite light and in line with the fun aspect of the game.\n\nUpon opening the main screen, you will find yourself in the witch's lair, with lighted candles, magic formula books and a few bottles of poisons and ingredients. On the right-hand side, you will see a skeleton-witch, moving his hands to create a ball of green light in motion. All symbols are drawn accurately, with some animations to make the game more captivating. The same applies to the sound aspect, with a slow, very relaxing tune that accompanies you with joy during spins.\n\nThe game grid has a traditional size, with 5 reels and 3 rows, offering 243 ways to win against a minimum bet of € 0.30 and a maximum of € 90.

It has a traditional game grid with a minimum bet of €0.30 and a maximum bet of €90. The game has a low volatility and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.08%. It works on any device, including mobile versions of the slot.\n\nTheme and design\n\nRitual Respins is a slot game with a Voodoo theme. The game has a witch's lair aesthetic, where the Voodoo doll, potions, poisons, and magic spells create a casual and playful atmosphere. Every symbol has accurate artwork with some animations that make the game more fascinating. The sound is a slow and relaxing tune that brings joy during the spins.\n\nSymbol variety and value\n\nThe lower-paying symbols are the playing cards from 10 to Ace. Going up in value, we have the potions and skulls, followed by the book and then the Voodoo doll. The woman figure is the Wild symbol that appears on 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th reels during the base gameplay and replaces all other icons except the scatter. The cauldron icon acts as Scatter and if two of them land during a spin, then a frog appears on the screen – if it explodes, the two Scatters remain fixed for a second chance. A third Scatter, represented by a treasure chest, triggers the free spins.\n\nFree spins and bonuses\n\nWhen three treasure chest Scatters show up during a spin, the free spins round begins. During this round, the Bonus symbols stick to the positions, and a prize ranging from 30 to 500 coins is applied to them. Winning requires the second Scatter to appear on the grid. The multipliers are applied when the Bonus symbol appears on the same reel side by side with the jackpots.\n\nWinning potential\n\nWith a maximum bet of €90 per spin, Ritual Respins has the potential to return up to 1,066 times your bet in winnings. The game's low volatility and 96.08% RTP make it an excellent choice for players that want to enjoy some casual gambling without risking too much of their bankroll. \n\n        \n            ",

The dark magic of Voodoo has arrived in Europe after previously taking Australia by storm. This slot game, created by Lightning Box, a subsidiary of Light & Wonder, is based on the theme of Voodoo, though don't expect dark and scary places, blood or human sacrifices. Instead, the atmosphere is quite light and in line with the fun aspect of the game.\n\nUpon opening the main screen, you will find yourself in the witch's lair, with lighted candles, magic formula books and a few bottles of poisons and ingredients. On the right-hand side, you will see a skeleton-witch, moving his hands to create a ball of green light in motion. All symbols are drawn accurately, with some animations to make the game more captivating. The same applies to the sound aspect, with a slow, very relaxing tune that accompanies you with joy during spins.\n\nThe game grid has a traditional size, with 5 reels and 3 rows, offering 243 ways to win against a minimum bet of € 0.30 and a maximum of € 90. The highest winning amount is equal to 1,066 times your bet. Thanks to HTML5 architecture, Ritual Respins works on any device, mobile and stationary, and with any operating system.\n\nAutoplay allows us to set a variable number of automatic spins, provided that the winning or losing limits are set beforehand. The variability is low, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.08%.\n\nSymbols and Bonuses of Ritual Respins\n\nNow let's take a closer look at the symbols and rules to follow to try and win with this slot. The least remunerative symbols are the playing cards good for creating a royal flush, from ten to ace. Going up in value, we find the potions and skulls, followed by the book and then the voodoo doll.\n\nThe woman is our Wild and appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 during base gameplay. It covers the classic function of a wildcard, replacing all symbols except for the Scatter, which are two. The first is the cauldron, and when two land during a spin, a frog will jump onto the grid. If it explodes, then we will have a second chance in which the two Scatters will remain on the reels. With a third scatter, the free spins are triggered, during which the Bonus symbols will remain stuck to the positions. Additionally, a prize ranging from 30 to 500 coins will be applied to each of them. However, to win, the second Scatter, represented by a treasure chest, must land on the grid.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the volatility of Ritual Respins? \n\nIn this slot, the volatility is low, meaning that you win often, but with not too high of payouts.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nIn Ritual Respins, the RTP is 96.08%.\n\nWhere can I play Ritual Respins? \n\nThis slot has recently arrived in Europe, so it will soon be available on all AAMS-certified online casinos.\n            ",

The dark magic of Voodoo has arrived in Europe after previously taking Australia by storm. This slot game, created by Lightning Box, a subsidiary of Light & Wonder, is based on the theme of Voodoo, though don't expect dark and scary places, blood or human sacrifices. Instead, the atmosphere is quite light and in line with the fun aspect of the game.\n\nUpon opening the main screen, you will find yourself in the witch's lair, with lighted candles, magic formula books and a few bottles of poisons and ingredients. On the right-hand side, you will see a skeleton-witch, moving his hands to create a ball of green light in motion. All symbols are drawn accurately, with some animations to make the game more captivating. The same applies to the sound aspect, with a slow, very relaxing tune that accompanies you with joy during spins.\n\nThe game grid has a traditional size, with 5 reels and 3 rows, offering 243 ways to win against a minimum bet of € 0.30 and a maximum of € 90. The highest winning amount is equal to 1,066 times your bet. Thanks to HTML5 architecture, Ritual Respins works on any device, mobile and stationary, and with any operating system.\n\nAutoplay allows us to set a variable number of automatic spins, provided that the winning or losing limits are set beforehand. The variability is low, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.08%.\n\nSymbols and Bonuses of Ritual Respins\n\nNow let's take a closer look at the symbols and rules to follow to try and win with this slot. The least remunerative symbols are the playing cards good for creating a royal flush, from ten to ace. Going up in value, we find the potions and skulls, followed by the book and then the voodoo doll.\n\nThe woman is our Wild and appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 during base gameplay. It covers the classic function of a wildcard, replacing all symbols except for the Scatter, which are two. The first is the cauldron, and when two land during a spin, a frog will jump onto the grid. If it explodes, then we will have a second chance in which the two Scatters will remain on the reels. With a third scatter, the free spins are triggered, during which the Bonus symbols will remain stuck to the positions. Additionally, a prize ranging from 30 to 500 coins will be applied to each of them. However, to win, the second Scatter, represented by a treasure chest, must land on the grid.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the volatility of Ritual Respins? \n\nIn this slot, the volatility is low, meaning that you win often, but with not too high of payouts.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nIn Ritual Respins, the RTP is 96.08%.\n\nWhere can I play Ritual Respins? \n\nThis slot has recently arrived in Europe, so it will soon be available on all AAMS-certified online casinos.\n            ",
