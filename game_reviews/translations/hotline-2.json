The new version introduces special features that differ from those seen in the previous Hotline game, including \"hotlines\". Players can bet a minimum of 10 cents up to a maximum of €50 per spin. The game is moderately volatile, and players may secure small wins more consistently, but patience is required for substantial payouts. The theoretical return to player (RTP) rate is 96%, which is typical for slot games. During free spins, the potential ways to win can increase up to 1,944.\n\nDesign and graphics of the game\n\nNetEnt has created a classic yet modern design that is both pleasing to the eye and perfect for the crime-themed slot game. The graphics depict Miami's streets and palm trees at sunset, creating a tranquil atmosphere. The colors used are subdued and work well with the classic design of the game. Hotline 2 also features two detectives reminiscent of Crockett and Tubbs from the Miami Vice TV series, who are in pursuit of a notorious thief called Kitty Weiss. The primary characters are present on the initial screen and as symbols on the reels.\n\nVolatility and potential winnings\n\nWith moderate volatility, Hotline 2 offers players more small wins more consistently. However, substantial payouts may require more patience. Players who stick with the game may win up to 5,184 times the value of their bet. The game has a theoretical RTP rate of 96%, which is typical for a slot game.\n\nSymbols and theme of the game\n\nHotline 2 features thematic symbols that include stolen jewels, detectives, and the thief Kitty Weiss, who provides the highest payouts. The game's theme is centered around crime and detectives chasing the elusive Kitty Weiss. The game is set in Miami and is reminiscent of the popular 80s TV series Miami Vice, complete with a sunset background featuring palm trees and long streets.\n\nBonus features like free spins and Wild/Scatter symbols\n\nHotline 2 features Wild and Scatter symbols. The Wild symbol features two race cars and replaces all symbols except for the Scatter symbol to help players complete winning combinations. The Scatter symbol is a flamingo that appears only on reels 2, 3, and 4, with seven free spins awarded to the player. Hotline is the game's main feature, a bonus function that expands symbols on the reels and increases the chances of winning. With these features, Hotline 2 provides experienced players with an exciting and challenging gameplay experience.\n\n        \n            ",

Are you ready to follow the detectives' clues?\nTheme and Graphics\nNetEnt, the Swedish software company, is one of the best providers in the current market and sets the standard for classic-themed slots with high-quality graphics.\nHotline 2 has a classic but highly effective design, both thematically and graphically. Set in Miami, the slot is reminiscent of the popular 80s TV series Miami Vice. The game features two detectives, resembling Crockett and Tubbs, on the trail of a notorious thief named Kitty Weiss.\nThe three main characters are present both on the initial screen and as symbols on the reels, with a typical Miami sunset background featuring long streets and palm trees. The colors used are subdued, which not only makes for an appealing graphic design but also creates a relaxing atmosphere.\nNetEnt had previously released a slot game called Hotline with similar thematics and graphics. This new version differs primarily in gameplay, introducing new special features along with the \"hotlines\" that made the game famous.\nMain Features of the Slot Game\nHotline 2 follows the traditional slot game structure with five reels and three rows. The game has 243 ways to win, with potential increases up to 1,944 during free spins.\nPlayers can bet a minimum of 10 cents up to a maximum of €50 per spin.\nThe game's volatility is moderate, and players are likely to secure consistent small wins, but patience is required for substantial payouts. Keep playing, and you could win up to 5,184 times the value of your bet!\nHotline 2 also has a theoretical return to player (RTP) rate of 96%, perfectly average for slot games.\nSymbols and Functions of Hotline 2\nThe symbols on the reels of this crime-themed slot game from NetEnt are entirely thematic and include a range of stolen jewels, detectives, and the alluring thief Kitty Weiss, who offers the highest payouts.\nThe Wild symbol features two race cars and replaces all symbols except for the Scatter to complete winning combinations. If it stops on a Hotline, it expands to cover the entire reel.\nThe Scatter symbol is a flamingo, appearing only on reels 2, 3, and 4 and rewarding players with seven free spins.\nHotline is the game's main feature, a bonus function that expands symbols on the reels and increases the chances of winning. Experienced players will find Hotline 2 an exciting challenge worthy of their skill.\n        ",
