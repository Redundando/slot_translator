L’ispirazione a questo capolavoro del cinema si sente tutta in Mystery Motel, la nuova slot della Hacksaw Gaming.\nTutto è importante a terrorizzare i giocatori, a partire dalla grafica e dai suoni sinistri che accompagnano le giocate. È notte, e sullo sfondo si staglia il motel segnalato anche dai cartelli che cadono a pezzi alla sinistra della griglia. In alto c’è l’insegna al neon con il nome della hotel e qualche corvo per rendere ancora più suggestiva l’atmosfera. Il comparto musicale è un motivetto incalzante intervallato di tanto in tanto dal verso dei corvi, altro richiamo all’immaginario hitchcockiano.\nNella parte bassa si trova il tasto per accedere al menù e i classici pulsanti per settare la scommessa, per lo Start e per l’Autoplay.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia ha una forma quadrata con 5 rulli e 5 righe, e ben 1.024 modalità di vincita.\nIl range di scommessa è accessibile a tutti, dato che la puntata minima è di 0,20 € e la massima di 100 €.\nSi vince quando simboli uguali compaiono su rulli adiacenti in qualsiasi punto della griglia.

Il valore RTP è del 96,3%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nIn Mystery Motel ci sono simboli regolari e altri speciali. I primi si suddividono in simboli tematici e non. Quelli di più basso valore  sono rappresentati dalle carte da gioco: con la puntata minima di 0,20 € si vince da un minimo di 0,02 € con 3 simboli e 0,06 € con 5 simboli.\nI simboli tematici hanno invece un valore più alto. Lo psicopatico con la mannaia e la cameriera pagano da 0,10 a 0,40 €, l’addetto alla reception sino a un massimo di 1 € e la ricca ospite sino a 2 €.\nLa valigia da cui fuoriesce una mano verde è il nostro simbolo Wild. Oltre a prendere il posto di tutti i simboli eccetto quelli speciali, ogni volta che compare verrà sostituito da un moltiplicatore variabile tra 2x, 3x o 5x. Nel caso di più moltiplicatori, essi vengono sommati. Facendo un calcolo veloce, il massimo moltiplicatore a cui possiamo aspirare è di 625x la puntata!\nI tentacoli che escono dalla macchina sono invece il simbolo Scatter. Attiva una ruota con 3 livelli su cui sono presenti tre possibili premi: una freccia che fa passare al livello superiore, un moltiplicatore e dei giri gratis.\nUn ulteriore simbolo speciale è la campanella della reception, che far ottenere alcuni Free Spins che possono essere riattivati sino a un massimo di 10 volte.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Features\n\nThe gameplay of Mystery Motel features a 5x5 grid with 1,024 ways to win and a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €100. To win, matching symbols must appear on adjacent reels in any position on the grid. There are regular symbols and special symbols, including Wild and Scatter symbols as well as the reception bell symbol that triggers Free Spins.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nIn Mystery Motel, special symbols include the Wild symbol in the form of a hand emerging from a suitcase which multiplies your winnings up to 625x. There is also the Scatter symbol represented by tentacles emerging from the machine, which activates a wheel with three levels that can result in multipliers, free spins, or progression to the next level. The reception bell symbol triggers Free Spins, and there are more Wild symbols during this feature for even more multipliers.\n\nGraphics and Sounds\n\nThe graphics and sounds in Mystery Motel are designed to set the tense and creepy mood inspired by the Hitchcockian motif behind this game. The nighttime setting of the motel looms ominously in the background while the music has a haunting theme that is occasionally interrupted by the sound of crows, creating a suspenseful atmosphere for the game.\n\nBonus Round\n\nMystery Motel's Bonus round has an RTP of 97.62%. Purchasing 12 free spins brings the RTP down to 96.13%, and 20 free spins sees an RTP of 96.19%. The special functions that can be purchased give players access to unique bonus features not found in the main game, making it a worthwhile addition for experienced players who are looking for even more excitement in their gameplay.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP)\n\nThe theoretical return to player in Mystery Motel is quite high with 97.62% for the Bonus round. However, that RTP drops to 96.13% when players purchase 12 free spins and 96.19% with 20 free spins. It's important to keep in mind that RTP only indicates the average expected return over a long period and isn't a guarantee of any particular outcome, and results will always vary with each player and session of the game. \n\n        \n            ",

You win when matching symbols appear on adjacent reels in any position on the grid. For example, you don't win if the same symbols appear on reels 1, 2, and 5, skipping the third and fourth.\n\nDesign and Sound Effects\n\nThe graphics and sinister sounds that accompany gameplay are all designed to terrify players. The game is set at night with the motel in the background, marked by signs that are falling apart to the left of the grid. Above is the neon sign with the name of the hotel and a few crows to make the atmosphere even more eerie. The music is a haunting theme that is occasionally interrupted by the sound of crows, further invoking the Hitchcockian imagery.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nThere are regular symbols and special symbols in 'Mystery Motel'. The lower value symbols are represented by playing cards, while the themed symbols are worth more. The suitcase from which a green hand emerges is the Wild symbol. In addition to replacing all symbols except for special ones, every time it appears it will be replaced by a multiplier that varies between 2x, 3x, or 5x. The tentacles that come out of the machine are the Scatter symbol. Another special symbol is the reception bell, which gives some Free Spins that can be reactivated up to a maximum of 10 times.\n\nBonus Round Details\n\nThe scatter tentacles activate a wheel with 3 levels, where there are three possible prizes: an arrow that moves to the next level, a multiplier, and free spins. During the Free Spins feature, there will be more Wild symbols and therefore more multipliers. Through the button on the right, it is possible to purchase special functions.\n\nRTP\n\nThe Bonus round has an RTP of 97.62%. By purchasing 12 free spins, the RTP drops to 96.13%, while with 20, the theoretical return to the player will be 96.19%.\n\n        \n            ",

This is felt in every aspect of \"Mystery Motel\", the new slot game from Hacksaw Gaming, which is inspired by this masterpiece of cinema.\n\nThe graphics and sinister sounds that accompany gameplay are all designed to terrify players. It's nighttime, and the motel looms in the background, marked by signs that are falling apart to the left of the grid. Above is the neon sign with the name of the hotel and a few crows to make the atmosphere even more eerie. The music is a haunting theme that is occasionally interrupted by the sound of crows, further invoking the Hitchcockian imagery.\n\nThe grid has a square shape with 5 reels and 5 rows, and an incredible 1,024 ways to win. The betting range is accessible to all, with a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €100.\n\nYou win when matching symbols appear on adjacent reels in any position on the grid. For example, you don't win if the same symbols appear on reels 1, 2, and 5, skipping the third and fourth.\n\nThere are regular symbols and special symbols in \"Mystery Motel\". The lower value symbols are represented by playing cards, while the themed symbols are worth more. The maniac with the axe and the waitress pay from €0.10 to €0.40, the receptionist up to a maximum of €1, and the wealthy guest up to €2.\n\nThe suitcase from which a green hand emerges is our Wild symbol. In addition to replacing all symbols except for special ones, every time it appears it will be replaced by a multiplier that varies between 2x, 3x, or 5x. In the case of multiple multipliers, they are added together. In total, the maximum multiplier is 625x the bet!\n\nThe tentacles that come out of the machine are the Scatter symbol. It activates a wheel with 3 levels, where there are three possible prizes: an arrow that moves to the next level, a multiplier, and free spins.\n\nAnother special symbol is the reception bell, which gives some Free Spins that can be reactivated up to a maximum of 10 times. It's worth noting that during this feature, there will be more Wild symbols and therefore more multipliers.\n\nThrough the button on the right, it is possible to purchase special functions.\n\nThe Bonus round has an RTP of 97.62%.\n\nBy purchasing 12 free spins, the RTP drops to 96.13%, while with 20, the theoretical return to the player will be 96.19%. \n\nAll in all, \"Mystery Motel\" is a thrilling slot game that will keep experienced gamblers on the edge of their seat!\n        ",
