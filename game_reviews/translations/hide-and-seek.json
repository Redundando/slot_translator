Lo sfondo mostra una sorta di vicolo buio che immaginiamo essere parte di un quartiere poco sicuro, con le luci fioche e i colori scuri. Anche le immagini sui rulli sono riprodotte allo stesso modo, determinando un effetto molto coinvolgente e che fa sentire il giocatore coinvolto nella storia.\nCi sono altre slot machine che hanno utilizzato come tema quello poliziesco, considerando però che non sono poi così diffuse, possiamo dire che questo prodotto di casa Merkur Gaming è da apprezzare in primo luogo per originalità, e vediamo ora il resto!\nCaratteristiche principali della slot\nLa struttura di gioco di Hide & Seek è quella di una slot machine tradizionale, costituita da cinque rulli e tre righe, che offre ben 243 modi per vincere.\nIl range di scommesse parte da un minimo di 1 € fino a un massimo di 100, soddisfacendo così più o meno tutte le varie tipologie di giocatori, da quelli occasionali agli high rollers.\nLa vincita più alta a cui si può ambire giocando con Hide & Seek è pari a 240 volte il valore della puntata, che rappresenta un premio davvero niente male!\nBuono anche il ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP), che sebbene non si attesti su percentuali altissime, propone un più che soddisfacente 96, 07%, perfettamente in linea con la maggior parte dei giochi di slot.\nSimboli e funzionalità speciali di Hide & Seek\nIn Hide & Seek troviamo sei simboli a basso valore, rappresentati dai numeri e dalle lettere che si riferiscono alle carte da gioco, in questo caso dal 9 all’Asso, con un pagamento medio pari a circa 0,5 volte il valore della puntata.\nI simboli tematici richiamano oggetti e personaggi tipici di una rapina in banca e comprendono dei candelotti di dinamite, una pistola, un segugio, una cassaforte e una macchina della polizia. I simboli più redditizi in assoluto sono il cane poliziotto e la cassaforte, quest’ultima che permette di vincere il jackpot con valore pari a 240 volte la scommessa, che in caso di puntata massima si traduce in 240.000 €!\nÈ presente un simbolo Wild, con funzione di jolly (anche Sticky Wild) e un poliziotto Scatter che se compare per almeno tre volte sui rulli vi fa accedere a un numero di giri gratuiti compreso tra 5 e 15.\n",

The theme is police related: it is a full-fledged hunt for the thief, with the villain, rigorously masked, dominating the reels and the police represented by police cars and well-trained hounds as counter-parties. The background shows a sort of dark alley that we imagine to be part of an unsafe neighborhood, with dim lights and dark colors. Even the images on the reels are reproduced in the same way, creating a very engaging effect that makes the player feel involved in the story.\n\nThere are other slot games that have used the police theme, but considering that they are not that common, we can say that this product from Merkur Gaming is to be appreciated primarily for its originality, and now let's look at the rest!\n\nMain features of the slot\nHide & Seek's game structure is that of a traditional slot machine, consisting of five reels and three rows, which offers 243 ways to win. The betting range starts at a minimum of €1 up to a maximum of €100, thus satisfying more or less all types of players, from occasional players to high rollers.\n\nThe highest possible win one can hope for by playing Hide & Seek is 240 times the value of the bet, which represents a really good prize! The theoretical return to player (RTP) is also good, although not at very high percentages, proposing a more than satisfactory 96.07%, perfectly in line with most slot games.\n\nSymbols and special features of Hide & Seek\nIn Hide & Seek, we find six low-value symbols, represented by numbers and letters that refer to playing cards. In this game, the numbers and letters range from 9 to Ace, with an average payout of about 0.5 times the value of the bet.\n\nThematic symbols recall objects and characters typical of a bank robbery and include dynamite sticks, a gun, a hound, a safe, and a police car. The most lucrative symbols are the police dog and the safe, the latter allowing you to win the jackpot with a value equal to 240 times the bet, which in the case of a maximum bet, translates into €240,000!\n\nThere is a Wild symbol, with a function of a joker (also as a Sticky Wild), and a Scatter police officer that if appearing at least three times on the reels, grants you access to a number of free spins ranging from 5 to 15.\n            ",

The betting range starts at a minimum of €1 up to a maximum of €100, thus satisfying more or less all types of players, from occasional players to high rollers.\n\nThe highest possible win one can hope for by playing Hide & Seek is 240 times the value of the bet, which represents a really good prize! The theoretical return to player (RTP) is also good, although not at very high percentages, proposing a more than satisfactory 96.07%, perfectly in line with most slot games.\n\nSymbols and special features of Hide & Seek\nIn Hide & Seek, we find six low-value symbols, represented by numbers and letters that refer to playing cards. In this game, the numbers and letters range from 9 to Ace, with an average payout of about 0.5 times the value of the bet.\n\nThematic symbols recall objects and characters typical of a bank robbery and include dynamite sticks, a gun, a hound, a safe, and a police car. The most lucrative symbols are the police dog and the safe, the latter allowing you to win the jackpot with a value equal to 240 times the bet, which in the case of a maximum bet, translates into €240,000!\n\nThere is a Wild symbol, with a function of a joker (also as a Sticky Wild), and a Scatter police officer that if appearing at least three times on the reels, grants you access to a number of free spins ranging from 5 to 15.\n        ",
