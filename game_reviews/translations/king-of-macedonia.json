Symbols must match on adjacent reels starting from the left to the right to achieve a win. Symbols are entirely thematic, with no standard Royals, and they are represented by scrolls, a lyre, amphorae, jewel boxes, and the inevitable helmets with red plumes. The Wild of the game is King Alexander, and it can take the place of any other symbol when a winning combination needs to be completed.

The graphics are very realistic and further confirm the IGT software house as one of the leaders in the slot machine market.\n\nTheme and Storyline\n\nThe theme of King of Macedonia is centered on Alexander the Great, one of the most famous rulers in history. Alexander the Great was a student of Aristotle, a military commander of great talent, and an empire ruler built at only thirty years old that extended from Greece to the lands of India. The slot machine is an online version of a land-based game already present in 2016.\n\nBonuses and Free Spins\n\nIn addition to the Wild, King of Macedonia features a Bonus symbol that can only appear on the first reel and gives a multiplier of ten times the value of the bet. When the Wild and Bonus symbols appear simultaneously, eight free spins are awarded to players. Players will find the slot fascinating, entertaining, and rewarding because of the bonuses and free spins that the game offers.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nKing of Macedonia, with its stunning graphics, excellent gameplay features, and bonuses, is an excellent slot game for both new and experienced players. Fans of past cultures, myths, legends, and characters in history will find this online slot game captivating. The game is suitable for players who enjoy a classic structure with a twist, and those who are attracted by the prospect of a big win through the multiplier and free spins.

The background is a riot of color, with gold shades highlighted on temples and jewels, in contrast to a magical sky.\nPlayers cannot fail to be satisfied with such beautiful graphics, which once again confirm the IGT software house as one of the leaders in the slot machine market.\nSymbols, gameplay, and features\nThe King of Macedonia slot machine has a classic structure with five reels and 40 paylines, with five rows instead of the usual three.\nTo win, identical symbols must be matched on adjacent reels starting from the left to the right.\nThe symbols are entirely thematic (there are no so-called \"royals\") and are represented by scrolls, a lyre, amphorae, some bowls, jewel boxes, and the inevitable helmets with red plumes; the symbols that have the highest value are instead a beautiful woman and black horses in a race.\nThe Wild of King of Macedonia could not be anyone other than King Alexander himself: it has the function of a wild card and as such can take the place of any other symbol when a winning combination needs to be completed.\nIn addition to the Wild, there is a Bonus symbol that can only appear on the first reel and gives a multiplier equal to 10 times the value of the bet; things get interesting when the Wild and Bonus symbols appear simultaneously, because in this case, eight free spins will be obtained.\nSlots similar to King of Macedonia\nIn the world of slot machines, there is no shortage of games dedicated to past cultures and myths, legends, and characters who have made history.\nFor example, there are countless slots dedicated to Ancient Egypt, starting from the successful Book of Ra series up to the most recent slots such as Eye of Horus Megaways by Blueprint Gaming.\nEven slots dedicated to Ancient Greece are numerous, especially those featuring Zeus and other Olympian gods. Among these, we can remember Kronos Unleashed, The Legend of Olympus, or Greek Gods by Pragmatic Play.\n        ",
