Well, he's back on the reels of Microgaming, ready for a new adventure set in the shade of the Pyramids. Three years after the release of Jungle Jim and El Dorado, Microgaming software house offers us a new chapter in the saga, improved both in terms of graphics and gameplay: it is in fact a sort of enhanced version of the original game, with a higher potential for winnings and different special features.\n\nThe base game is a classic with five reels and 35 paylines, but as you spin the reels, you level up, and each level corresponds to a multiplier that starts at 2x for the first level and reaches 10x with the fifth (twice as much as the maximum multiplier of El Dorado).\n\nThe graphics are essential but really well-kept and very clean: the background is a desert landscape at sunset, on which a temple adorned with hieroglyphics stands out and inside which we find the real screen with symbols.\n\nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters\n\nThe symbolism of Jungle Jim And The Lost Sphinx is obviously thematic, referring to ancient Egyptian culture: among the reels, we find the Book of Ra, an amphora, an inlaid box, and a sort of shield.\n\nThe Wild symbol of this slot machine is represented by the explorer Jim himself, who acts as a Joker and replaces all the other symbols, except for the Scatter, to determine a winning combination. The Scatter is instead the game logo and allows access to the Bonus Free Spins function.\n\nIn addition to these thematic symbols, we also find gems of different colors: red, orange, green, and blue; precious stones are also present in the previous chapter of the Jim explorer saga and represent a point of continuity between the two games.\n\nJungle Jim And The Lost Sphinx: Conclusion\n\nThis brand new slot machine (released on November 3rd '19) by Microgaming has a simple and intuitive gameplay mode, while not being ordinary at all: as a result, Jungle Jim And The Lost Sphinx is suitable to be played both by those who are new to the world of slot machines, and by more experienced players who want to try to win even substantial amounts. The variance of this slot machine is, in fact, medium-high: this means that winnings, while not being very frequent, can reach considerable amounts, and indeed, Jungle Jim And The Lost Sphinx offers a maximum win of 6,250 times the bet during free spins, almost twice as much as El Dorado, which instead offered 3,680x.\n\nOverall, because of the simple but rich gameplay, the possibility of substantial winnings, and a very engaging graphics and theme, we feel confident in recommending this game to experienced gamblers!\n\nAll you have to do is pack your bags and set off with the explorer Jim!\n            ",
