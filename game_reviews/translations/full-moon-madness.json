Produced by Skywind, a software house that may not be among the most well-known and reputable providers, but has released some very nice and fun slot games on the market, often with truly special bonus features.\n\nThe graphics of Full Moon Madness are in cartoon style, with the monsters peeking out above the slot title on the game's initial screen, and the reels standing against the backdrop of a haunted castle.\n\nKey features of the slot game\n\nThis extremely fun Skywind slot game has a five-reel, three-row structure, and offers 243 ways to win instead of the usual paylines. For betting options, on Full Moon Madness, players can vary the value of the token and bet from a minimum of 0.6 credits up to a maximum of 300 credits per spin.\n\nOne thing to note about Full Moon Madness is the theoretical RTP or Return to Player, which is an impressive 96.61%, over half a point higher than most slot games. The volatility of this slot machine is instead medium-high, meaning that you should not expect small and frequent wins, but with a little patience, you will have the opportunity to get your hands on really interesting prizes!\n\nSymbols and features of Full Moon Madness\n\nThe symbols that can be found on the reels of Full Moon Madness are entirely thematic and really well-detailed, making for a very enjoyable and fun gaming experience.\n\nThe symbols that pay the least are the bone, beetle and torch, which offer wins up to 10 times the token value, followed by the bolts that \"build\" Frankenstein's head and a cup of blood, with payouts up to 15x.\n\nThe symbols that pay the most are those depicting the images of the four main monsters of Full Moon Madness: the Mummy, the Werewolf, Frankenstein and Count Dracula, the latter of which offers wins equal to 50 times the bet value in case of an alignment of 5 symbols.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by the slot machine logo, which acts as a wild card, replacing all other symbols except the Scatter in completing a winning combination, and also paying out in combinations of identical symbols, up to 100 times the bet.\n\nThe Scatter symbol is the haunted castle with the full moon in the background. When it appears at least six times on the reels, it allows access to the special feature of Full Moon Madness, in which players can enjoy a variable number of free spins where all symbols become Stacked and winnings are made even more interesting thanks to the presence of various multipliers.\n            ",
