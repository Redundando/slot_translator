The developers have created a game that perfectly matches the chosen theme with the right amount of references and echoes.\n\nUnique game grid with 5 reels\n\nJumanji has a game grid that is different from most online slots. It has five reels, but the number of symbols each of them shows varies among them. The first and last reel show three symbols, the second and fourth show four, and the central reel shows five, which means that 19 symbols are shown instead of the usual 15.\n\nSpecial features: Respins, scatters, Wilds\n\nJumanji has numerous special features, from the symbols themselves, such as the game box as a scatter symbol and the word 'Wild' as the Wild symbol, to functions such as climbing plants that block specific symbols and assign Respins. With 36 winning lines, players can expect a gameplay that is always varied and entertaining.\n\nNods to the movie theme in the design\n\nJumanji has various nods to the movie in its design, such as the game grid contained within the game path, like a haunted goose game, and some references to the feature film frame the game, such as the monkeys in the kitchen or the plants grown inside the Parrish residence. The symbols that are arranged in the various combinations are the animals that appear in the course of the film (pelican, crocodile, rhinoceros, and lion) and the letters of the playing cards depicted with the same font as the title itself.\n\nFun and exciting gameplay\n\nJust like in the original Jumanji, players cannot know what to expect from this slot during their plays, which allows them to have a gameplay that is always varied and entertaining. The music that accompanies the game is a more rhythmic and musical version of the percussion expected in a game of this type. Overall, Jumanji offers a fun and exciting gameplay experience that will keep players coming back for more.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame Design and Theme\n\nJumanji is a slot game based on the classic 90s movie of the same name. NetEnt has done an excellent job of matching the theme with the right amount of references and echoes. The game grid resembles a game path, and there are nods to the feature film throughout the game, such as monkeys in the kitchen and plants grown inside the Parrish residence. The symbols are the animals that appear in the movie, and the font is the same as the title. The game's music is a rhythmic and musical version of the film's percussion.\n\nUnique Game Grid and Number of Winning Lines\n\nJumanji's game mechanics are different from most online slot games. The game grid consists of five reels, with varying numbers of symbols on each. The first and last reels have three symbols, the second and fourth have four, and the central reel has five. Therefore, instead of displaying 15 symbols per play, 19 are shown. This unique design benefits the special modes and increases the number of winning lines up to 36.\n\nSpecial Features Included\n\nJumanji has numerous special features, including a scatter symbol (the game box) and a Wild symbol (represented by the word Wild). Some symbols trigger functions such as the climbing plants that block certain symbols and assign Respins. This provides a varied and entertaining gameplay, much like the original Jumanji movie.\n\nNods to the Original Jumanji Movie\n\nNetEnt has done an excellent job of adding nods and references to the original Jumanji movie throughout the game. These nods include monkeys in the kitchen and plants grown inside the Parrish residence. The symbols in the game are the animals that appear in the movie, and the font is the same as the title. All of these elements help to create an immersive experience that fans of the original movie will appreciate.\n\nComparison to Other Movie-Inspired Slot Games\n\nJumanji is a unique game with its game mechanics and nods to the original movie. While there are other slots inspired by popular movies like Dirty Dancing and Top Gun, Jumanji stands out on its own. Its unique design, special features, and nods to the original movie make it a game that fans of the movie and online slot gamers will enjoy alike.\n\n        \n            ",

How can one not appreciate a movie that combines a cursed board game with supernatural powers and the love for Robin Williams?\nThat's why it's a pleasure to rediscover this cinematic masterpiece thanks to NetEnt's themed slot, especially considering the quality and attention to detail that the developers have reserved for this title.\nLet's talk more in-depth about this in our review.\nJumanji - In the jungle, you must survive...\nWhen opening a slot inspired by such a beloved film, it is natural to have a little skepticism. Despite this, NetEnt has managed to create a slot that perfectly matches the chosen theme with the right amount of references and echoes.\nThe game grid is contained within the game path, like a haunted goose game, and some nods to the feature film frame the game, such as the monkeys in the kitchen or the plants grown inside the Parrish residence.\nThe music that accompanies the game is a more rhythmic and musical version of the percussion that one can expect in a game of this type, while the symbols that are arranged in the various combinations are the animals that appear in the course of the film (pelican, crocodile, rhinoceros, and lion) and the letters of the playing cards (K, Q, J...) depicted with the same font as the title itself.\nIn short: Jumanji has everything on paper to be the worthy game of the beloved feature film, but let's take a closer look at the game mechanics.\nJumanji - ...until a 5 or an 8 appears!\nJust take a look at the slot to understand that it is different from most of the titles you can play online. The same game grid has a shape far from the usual 5*3 format today. The slot indeed presents five reels, but the number of symbols each of them shows varies among them. The first and last reel show three symbols, the second and fourth show four, and the central reel shows five.\nIn this way, instead of showing fifteen symbols at each play, 19 are shown. Both the special modes and the number of winning lines that goes up to 36 benefit from this.\nAs we have previously mentioned, there are numerous special features: from the symbols themselves (the game box is a scatter symbol, and the Wild symbol is represented by the same word), to functions such as climbing plants that block specific symbols and assign Respins.\nJust like the original Jumanji, we cannot know what to expect from this slot during our plays, which allows us to have a gameplay that is always varied and entertaining.\nSlots similar to Jumanji\nJumanji is unique in its genre... we've said it several times, and we'll continue to repeat it, in immortal honor of the good Robin, but there are numerous slots inspired by the most appreciated movies of the small and big screen. From Playtech's Dirty Dancing and Top Gun to Blueprint Gaming's Ted.\n        ",
