Un minatore con cappello da cowboy e un asino bizzoso proveranno a far crollare la roccia utilizzando candelotti di dinamite e un semplice piccone.\nLa grafica di questa slot ha lo stile dei cartoni animati ed è ricca di animazioni. La griglia si trova all’interno di una cava, sul lato sinistro c’è l’asinello con davanti tre sagome di carote e un contatore. A destra c’è il minatore e poco più in alto si trova una borsa per le pepite d’oro che fungerà da moltiplicatore al verificarsi di particolari condizioni illustrate più avanti.\nNella parte sottostante troviamo gli importi delle puntate selezionabili, il tasto Play e quello per i giri automatici. Il sottofondo musicale è un motivetto allegro e incalzante, condito da numerosi effetti sonori associati alle varie situazioni di gioco.\nCaratteristiche di Miner Donkey Trouble\nLa griglia ha 5 rulli e ben 7 righe, l’ultima delle quali evidenziata da una cornice dorata. La puntata minima di 0,10 € permette di giocare con una certa leggerezza anche a chi si avvicina per la prima volta al mondo delle slot, ma per chi ama l’azzardo è comunque possibile puntare sino a 100 €. La volatilità è alta, mentre invece il valore RTP è un po’ bassino, essendo pari al 94,26%, anche se bisogna tenere sempre a mente che tale percentuale è calcolata su un numero molto grande di partite.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nIn Miner Donkey Trouble non ci sono simboli delle carte da gioco, ma solo pietre preziose e pepite d’oro più o meno grandi. Le combinazioni vanno da un minimo di 5 simboli uguali sino a un massimo di 18. L’ultima riga della griglia è evidenziata da una cornice dorata: quando una pepita ci cade all’interno, verrà assegnato un moltiplicatore x1 visibile nella borsa sulla destra. Ogni volta che si aggiunge una pepita, il moltiplicatore aumenterà di uno.\nA seguito di una combinazione vincente, i simboli esploderanno e verranno sostituiti da altri simboli. Dopo ogni esplosione il cursore che si trova nel contatore di sinistra avanzerà, e quando sarà pieno, l’asinello verrà ricompensato con una carota. In cambio l’animale scalcerà la griglia, distruggendo tutti i simboli roccia. Con due carote rimuoverà tutti i simboli gemma e roccia e con la terza garantirà sino a 5 pepite d’oro.\nIl simbolo del piccone invece garantisce da 4 a 10 simboli Wild, rappresentati da un grosso diamante. Come al solito, il simbolo sostituirà tutti gli altri eccetto quelli speciali.\nLa dinamite invece distrugge parte dei simboli, se avremo tre esplosioni ci verranno assegnati da 5 a 20 Free Spins.\nDi tanto in tanto può comparire un simbolo random che sostituisce gli altri, ma anche simboli mega 2×2, 3×3 o 4×4!\n",

A miner wearing a cowboy hat and a mischievous donkey will try to bring down the rocks using dynamite sticks and a simple pickaxe.\n\nThe graphics of this slot have a cartoon style and are full of animations. The grid is located inside a quarry, on the left side there is the donkey with three carrot cutouts in front of it and a counter. On the right side, there is the miner and a little higher up is a bag for the gold nuggets that will act as a multiplier when certain conditions occur.\n\nIn the lower part, we find the selectable betting amounts, the Play button, and the one for automatic spins. The background music is a cheerful and catchy tune, accompanied by numerous sound effects associated with various game situations.\n\nFeatures of Miner Donkey Trouble\nThe grid has 5 reels and a whopping 7 rows, the last of which is highlighted by a golden frame. The minimum bet of €0.10 allows you to play with some ease even for those approaching the world of slots for the first time, but for those who love gambling, it is still possible to bet up to €100. The volatility is high, while the RTP value is a bit low, being equal to 94.26%. However, it is always important to keep in mind that this percentage is calculated over a large number of games.\n\nSymbols and Features\nIn Miner Donkey Trouble, there are no playing card symbols, but only precious stones and more or less large gold nuggets. The combinations range from a minimum of 5 identical symbols up to a maximum of 18. The last row of the grid is highlighted by a golden frame: when a nugget falls inside it, a visible x1 multiplier will be assigned to the bag on the right. Every time a nugget is added, the multiplier will increase by one.\n\nFollowing a winning combination, the symbols will explode and be replaced by other symbols. After each explosion, the cursor in the left counter will move forward, and when it is full, the donkey will be rewarded with a carrot. In exchange, the animal will kick the grid, destroying all rock symbols. With two carrots, it will remove all gem and rock symbols, and with the third, it will guarantee up to 5 gold nuggets.\n\nThe pickaxe symbol guarantees from 4 to 10 Wild symbols, represented by a large diamond. As usual, the symbol will replace all others except the special ones. The dynamite, on the other hand, destroys some of the symbols, and if we have three explosions, we will be assigned from 5 to 20 Free Spins. From time to time, a random symbol may appear that replaces the others, but also mega 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4 symbols!\n            ",

The background music is a cheerful and catchy tune, accompanied by numerous sound effects associated with various game situations.\n\nFeatures of Miner Donkey Trouble\nThe grid has 5 reels and a whopping 7 rows, the last of which is highlighted by a golden frame. The minimum bet of €0.10 allows you to play with some ease even for those approaching the world of slots for the first time, but for those who love gambling, it is still possible to bet up to €100. The volatility is high, while the RTP value is a bit low, being equal to 94.26%. However, it is always important to keep in mind that this percentage is calculated over a large number of games.\n\nSymbols and Features\nIn Miner Donkey Trouble, there are no playing card symbols, but only precious stones and more or less large gold nuggets. The combinations range from a minimum of 5 identical symbols up to a maximum of 18. The last row of the grid is highlighted by a golden frame: when a nugget falls inside it, a visible x1 multiplier will be assigned to the bag on the right. Every time a nugget is added, the multiplier will increase by one.\n\nFollowing a winning combination, the symbols will explode and be replaced by other symbols. After each explosion, the cursor in the left counter will move forward, and when it is full, the donkey will be rewarded with a carrot. In exchange, the animal will kick the grid, destroying all rock symbols. With two carrots, it will remove all gem and rock symbols, and with the third, it will guarantee up to 5 gold nuggets.\n\nThe pickaxe symbol guarantees from 4 to 10 Wild symbols, represented by a large diamond. As usual, the symbol will replace all others except the special ones. The dynamite, on the other hand, destroys some of the symbols, and if we have three explosions, we will be assigned from 5 to 20 Free Spins. From time to time, a random symbol may appear that replaces the others, but also mega 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4 symbols!\n            ",
