Innanzitutto, ci troviamo a giocare su una griglia 5×3, con 27 linee di pagamento e una puntata minima di 0,25 €.\nPer vincere è necessario associare simboli identici a partire dal rullo di sinistra procedendo verso destra, o concludere la combo con il simbolo Jolly.\nLa volatilità di Cloud Corsairs è alta, mentre il dato RTP si attesta su un ottimo 96,34%.\nI simboli regolari sono 8, 4 di basso livello e 4 di alto livello.

Dopo 4 simboli bonus, verrà sbloccato uno slot in più dei moltiplicatori che si trovano sulla sinistra e si avrà diritto a ulteriori 4 giri extra; con 9 simboli gli slot sbloccati saranno due e si otterranno altri 4 giri gratuiti; con 15 bonus si attiva il Super Free Spins.

Fast airships like planes, cities suspended in the clouds, steam-driven machines, gears capable of moving tons of iron - these are the fundamental elements of this literary movement, of which H.G. Wells is one of the greatest exponents.\nIn this slot, the protagonists are sky pirates who will try in every way to plunder the commercial flights arriving at the city suspended in the clouds.\nIn Cloud Corsairs, graphics are one of the main protagonists of the game, with cartoon-style drawings and characters with very meticulous definition.\nSlot Features\nLet's leave the graphic aspect and game mechanics aside for a moment to focus on the functions available in this game. First of all, we find ourselves playing on a 5×3 grid, with 27 paylines and a minimum bet of €0.25.\nTo win, you need to match identical symbols starting from the left reel and moving right, or complete the combo with the Wild symbol.\nThe volatility of Cloud Corsairs is high, while the RTP figure stands at an excellent 96.34%.\nThere are 8 regular symbols, 4 low-level and 4 high-level. The former are represented by wind roses of different colors, the latter by the pirates of the story. Next to the fifth reel, there is an additional reel on which there are multipliers that help increase the value of wins.\nIn Cloud Corsairs, we have three special functions:\n\nZeppelin Respins: This function is activated when the winning combo includes the airship symbol, which will remain locked while resins trigger various multipliers for up to 50x.\nBonus: With three bonus symbols, you get 12 free spins. Here, wins pay in both directions, from left to right and vice versa. Every time additional bonus symbols appear, a special counter on the left of the grid will move up to reach the three objectives. After 4 bonus symbols, one more slot of the multipliers on the left will be unlocked, and you'll be entitled to an additional 4 extra spins; with 9 symbols, two unlocked slots will be available, and you'll get another 4 free spins; with 15 bonuses, the Super Free Spins are activated. In this case, the grid is emptied, and only airships appear.\nLightning Mystery: in this case, lightning incinerates six random symbols and replaces them to form winning combos.\n\nExperienced gamblers know that a slot game should be more than just pretty graphics and thematic sounds, and Cloud Corsairs delivers on all fronts. With multiple bonus features that can lead to big wins, this game appeals to players who demand more complexity in their gameplay.

Fast airships like planes, cities suspended in the clouds, steam-driven machines, gears capable of moving tons of iron - these are the fundamental elements of this literary movement, of which H.G. Wells is one of the greatest exponents.\nIn this slot, the protagonists are sky pirates who will try in every way to plunder the commercial flights arriving at the city suspended in the clouds.\nIn Cloud Corsairs, graphics are one of the main protagonists of the game, with cartoon-style drawings and characters with very meticulous definition.\nSlot Features\nLet's leave the graphic aspect and game mechanics aside for a moment to focus on the functions available in this game. First of all, we find ourselves playing on a 5×3 grid, with 27 paylines and a minimum bet of €0.25.\nTo win, you need to match identical symbols starting from the left reel and moving right, or complete the combo with the Wild symbol.\nThe volatility of Cloud Corsairs is high, while the RTP figure stands at an excellent 96.34%.\nThere are 8 regular symbols, 4 low-level and 4 high-level. The former are represented by wind roses of different colors, the latter by the pirates of the story. Next to the fifth reel, there is an additional reel on which there are multipliers that help increase the value of wins.\nIn Cloud Corsairs, we have three special functions:\n\nZeppelin Respins: This function is activated when the winning combo includes the airship symbol, which will remain locked while resins trigger various multipliers for up to 50x.\nBonus: With three bonus symbols, you get 12 free spins. Here, wins pay in both directions, from left to right and vice versa. Every time additional bonus symbols appear, a special counter on the left of the grid will move up to reach the three objectives. After 4 bonus symbols, one more slot of the multipliers on the left will be unlocked, and you'll be entitled to an additional 4 extra spins; with 9 symbols, two unlocked slots will be available, and you'll get another 4 free spins; with 15 bonuses, the Super Free Spins are activated. In this case, the grid is emptied, and only airships appear.\nLightning Mystery: in this case, lightning incinerates six random symbols and replaces them to form winning combos.\n\nExperienced gamblers know that a slot game should be more than just pretty graphics and thematic sounds, and Cloud Corsairs delivers on all fronts. With multiple bonus features that can lead to big wins, this game appeals to players who demand more complexity in their gameplay. Give it a spin and see if you have what it takes to become a sky pirate legend.\n            ",

To win, players need to match identical symbols starting from the left reel and moving right, or complete the combo with the Wild symbol. The game's volatility is high, while the RTP figure stands at an excellent 96.34%. Next to the fifth reel, there is an additional reel on which there are multipliers that help increase the value of wins.\n\nSymbols and paylines\n\nThere are 8 regular symbols in Cloud Corsairs, 4 low-level and 4 high-level. The low-level symbols are represented by wind roses of different colors, while the high-level symbols are the pirates of the story. The airship symbol is the Wild. To make a winning combo, players must match symbols on any of the 27 paylines starting from the left reel and moving right.\n\nSpecial features\n\nCloud Corsairs offers three special functions. 1) Zeppelin Respins, triggered when the winning combo includes the airship symbol, which remains locked while respins trigger various multipliers for up to 50x. 2) Bonus, triggered with three bonus symbols, players get 12 free spins, and wins pay in both directions, from left to right and vice versa. A special counter on the left of the grid moves up every time additional bonus symbols appear, unlocking more multipliers and granting additional free spins. 3) Lightning Mystery, where lightning incinerates six random symbols and replaces them to form winning combos.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nCloud Corsairs has high volatility and an RTP figure of an excellent 96.34%. The volatility level reflects the frequency of wins in a game. Higher volatility means less frequent, but bigger wins. The RTP figure is the percentage of wagered money that a slot machine returns to players, on average, over a long period.\n\nSteampunk theme\n\nCloud Corsairs is a steampunk-themed game, revolving around a group of sky pirates trying to plunder commercial flights. The game's graphics are cartoon-style drawings and characters with meticulous definition. The steampunk theme adds an exciting element to the game, with fast airships, steam-driven machines, gears capable of moving tons of iron, and cities suspended in the clouds.\n\n        \n            ",

Here, wins pay in both directions, from left to right and vice versa. Every time additional bonus symbols appear, a special counter on the left of the grid will move up to reach the three objectives. After 4 bonus symbols, one more slot of the multipliers on the left will be unlocked, and you'll be entitled to an additional 4 extra spins; with 9 symbols, two unlocked slots will be available, and you'll get another 4 free spins; with 15 bonuses, the Super Free Spins are activated. In this case, the grid is emptied, and only airships appear.\nLightning Mystery: in this case, lightning incinerates six random symbols and replaces them to form winning combos.\n\nExperienced gamblers know that a slot game should be more than just pretty graphics and thematic sounds, and Cloud Corsairs delivers on all fronts.

After 4 bonus symbols, one more slot of the multipliers on the left will be unlocked, and you'll be entitled to an additional 4 extra spins; with 9 symbols, two unlocked slots will be available, and you'll get another 4 free spins; with 15 bonuses, the Super Free Spins are activated. In this case, the grid is emptied, and only airships appear.\nLightning Mystery: in this case, lightning incinerates six random symbols and replaces them to form winning combos.\n\nExperienced gamblers know that a slot game should be more than just pretty graphics and thematic sounds, and Cloud Corsairs delivers on all fronts. With multiple bonus features that can lead to big wins, this game appeals to players who demand more complexity in their gameplay. Give it a spin and see if you have what it takes to become a sky pirate legend.\n            ",

Fast airships like planes, cities suspended in the clouds, steam-driven machines, gears capable of moving tons of iron - these are the fundamental elements of this literary movement, of which H.G. Wells is one of the greatest exponents.\nIn this slot, the protagonists are sky pirates who will try in every way to plunder the commercial flights arriving at the city suspended in the clouds.\nIn Cloud Corsairs, graphics are one of the main protagonists of the game, with cartoon-style drawings and characters with very meticulous definition.\nSlot Features\nLet's leave the graphic aspect and game mechanics aside for a moment to focus on the functions available in this game. First of all, we find ourselves playing on a 5×3 grid, with 27 paylines and a minimum bet of €0.25.\nTo win, you need to match identical symbols starting from the left reel and moving right, or complete the combo with the Wild symbol.\nThe volatility of Cloud Corsairs is high, while the RTP figure stands at an excellent 96.34%.\nThere are 8 regular symbols, 4 low-level and 4 high-level. The former are represented by wind roses of different colors, the latter by the pirates of the story. Next to the fifth reel, there is an additional reel on which there are multipliers that help increase the value of wins.\nIn Cloud Corsairs, we have three special functions:\n\nZeppelin Respins: This function is activated when the winning combo includes the airship symbol, which will remain locked while resins trigger various multipliers for up to 50x.\nBonus: With three bonus symbols, you get 12 free spins. Here, wins pay in both directions, from left to right and vice versa. Every time additional bonus symbols appear, a special counter on the left of the grid will move up to reach the three objectives. After 4 bonus symbols, one more slot of the multipliers on the left will be unlocked, and you'll be entitled to an additional 4 extra spins; with 9 symbols, two unlocked slots will be available, and you'll get another 4 free spins; with 15 bonuses, the Super Free Spins are activated. In this case, the grid is emptied, and only airships appear.\nLightning Mystery: in this case, lightning incinerates six random symbols and replaces them to form winning combos.\n\nExperienced gamblers know that a slot game should be more than just pretty graphics and thematic sounds, and Cloud Corsairs delivers on all fronts. With multiple bonus features that can lead to big wins, this game appeals to players who demand more complexity in their gameplay. Give it a spin and see if you have what it takes to become a sky pirate legend.\n        ",
