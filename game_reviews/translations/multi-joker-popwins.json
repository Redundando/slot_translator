                            "content": "Multi Joker Popwins\n\nThe latest offering from provider StakeLogic, Multi Joker PopWins, proves that you can't keep a Joker down. This game is a remake of the original title, Joker Drop PopWins. In this new version, there are modifications to the free spin multipliers, a refresh of the features, and a few minor additions. Is it better, worse, or the same? It's time to find out in my review!\n\nGame details\n\nIn the standard version of this fruit slot, every spin begins on a matrix composed of 5 reels and 4 rows, which increase when you get wins. At the default size, there are 2,048 ways to win that pay from left to right. This highly volatile game with an RTP of 96.20% allows you to select bets from €0.20 up to €20.\n\nSymbol present in the new version of Multi Joker Popwins\n\nThe same symbols used in Joker Drop PopWins are also used in this new gameplay, with the same values as before. Therefore, there are low-value card suits 10-A and icons of cherries, limes, pears, plums, oranges, grapes, watermelons, and sevens as the most generous symbols.\n\nGet a win of five to receive 0.5/0.6 times the bet for the royals or 0.75x/5x the bet for five prizes. The wild can replace any symbol except for the scatter.\n\nStandard features and extra options\n\nThe PopWins mechanic, also playable from your iOS and Android mobile devices, has been in circulation for some time, but if you need an update, here's how it works. When a winning combination arrives, the symbols that formed it are removed and replaced by two new ones.\n\nNaturally, this increases the height of the corresponding reels, as well as the number of ways to win. The reels have a maximum limit of 7 positions and are reset to their default size in the base game for the next spin. When the reels have expanded to their maximum, winning symbols are replaced by a single new icon instead of two. Now let's see the features that can be activated during the spins:\n\nDiamond Meter\nThe Diamond Meter is one of three meters that appear in the base game. Small diamond tokens can randomly appear above symbols and are collected in a meter when they land. Filling the meter with 5 diamonds in a single spin adds 5 wilds on reels 2, 3, and 4. At this point, the container empties, and the spins reset;\n\nCoin Meter\nEven crown tokens randomly land on the main symbols and are collected. When the meter has been filled with 5 crown tokens in the same spin, coin symbols stop on the reels, revealing cash prizes, and the meter empties;\n\nFree Spins\nThe third meter is filled when all five reels reach 7 positions up in the base game. When this happens, free spins are activated with allocations from 8 to 15 FS from a single wheel spin, plus a random wheel multiplier. In addition, multiplier symbols with values up to x100 may appear and be added to the current win;\n\nSuper Stake\nActivating the Super Stake, which doubles the bet, scatter symbols are added to the reels during free spins on reels 2, 3, and 4. Obtaining 3 scatter symbols assigns +5 free spins;\n\nBuy Bonus feature\nThis button allows you to buy free spins. It comes with four choices, each of which assigns up to 15 free spins. With Super Stake off, the options are 100x, 200x, 400x, or 180x the total bet for multipliers up to x10, x15, x25, or a random win multiplier. Prices vary when Super Stake is active.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow much does it cost to buy the Multi Joker PopWins bonus?\n\nThe higher the multiplier, the more expensive the bonus purchase. For free spins + 10x multiplier, you pay 100x your bet, for 15x multiplier 200x, 25x multiplier costs 400x, and the random option costs 180x.\n\nCan I reactivate free spins in Multi Joker PopWins?\n\nYes, during the Free Spins feature, 3 Scatters that fall on the reels will give you 5 free spins.\n\nWhat is the success rate of Multi Joker PopWins?\n\nThe success rate of Multi Joker PopWins is 4.59 and 4.17 with the Super Stake feature. If you're a fan of Megaways slots, I recommend trying Super Joker Megaways from StakeLogic or one of the numerous titles (+75) from this provider directly on our list."

It is a remake of the original game called Joker Drop PopWins. In this new version, you will find modifications to the free spins multipliers, a refresh on the features, and some small additions. Is it better, worse, or the same? It's time to find out in my review!\n\nMulti Joker Popwins: basic game details\n\nIn the standard version of this Fruit slot game, each spin starts on a matrix consisting of 5 reels and 4 rows, which increase when you get wins. At the default size, there are 2,048 ways to win paying from left to right. The highly volatile game with an RTP of 96.20% allows you to select bets from €0.20 up to €20.\n\nSymbols present in the new version Multi Joker Popwins\n\nThe same symbols used in Joker Drop PopWins are also used in this new gameplay, with the same values as before. There are the 10-A card suits of lower value and icons of cherries, limes, pears, plums, oranges, grapes, watermelons, and sevens as the more generous bunch.\n\nGet a five-win to receive 0.5/0.6 times the bet for the royals or 0.75x/5x the bet for five prizes. The wild can substitute any symbol except for the Scatter.\n\nMulti Joker PopWins: standard features and extra options\n\nThe PopWins mechanic, also playable from your iOS and Android mobile device, has been around for a while, but if you need an update, here's how it works. When a winning combination arrives, the symbols that formed it are removed and replaced with two new ones.\n\nNaturally, this increases the height of the corresponding reels, as well as the number of ways to win. The reels have a maximum limit of 7 positions and are reset to their default size in the base game for the next spin. When the reels have expanded to their maximum, winning symbols are replaced with a single new icon instead of two. Let's now see the features that can be activated during spins:\n\nDiamond Meter\n\nThe Diamond Meter is one of three meters that appear in the base game. Small diamond tokens can randomly appear above symbols and are collected in a meter when they land. Filling the meter with 5 diamonds in a single spin adds 5 wilds on reels 2, 3, and 4. At that point, the container is emptied, and spins are reset;\n\nCoin Meter\n\nEven the crown tokens randomly land on the main symbols and are collected. When the meter has been filled with 5 crown tokens in the same spin, coin symbols stop on the reels, revealing cash prizes, and the meter is emptied;\n\nFree Spins\n\nThe third meter is full when all five reels reach 7 positions high in the base game. When this happens, free spins are activated with assignments ranging from 8 to 15 FS from a wheel spin, plus a multiplier from a random wheel. Additionally, multiplier symbols with values up to x100 may appear, adding to the current win;\n\nSuper Stake\n\nBy activating the Super Stake, which doubles your bet, Scatter symbols are added to the reels during free spins on reels 2, 3, and 4. Getting 3 Scatter symbols assigns +5 free spins;\n\nBuy Bonus feature\n\nThis is a button that allows you to buy free spins. It comes with four choices, each of which assigns up to 15 free spins. With Super Stake turned off, the options are 100x, 200x, 400x, or 180x the total bet for multipliers up to x10, x15, x25, or a random win multiplier. Prices vary when Super Stake is active.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow much does buying a bonus cost in Multi Joker PopWins?\n\nThe higher the multiplier, the more expensive the bonus purchase will be. For free spins + 10x multiplier, you pay 100x your bet, for 15x multiplier, 200x, 25x multiplier costs 400x, and the random option costs 180x.\n\nCan I retrigger free spins in Multi Joker PopWins?\n\nYes, during the Free Spins feature, 3 Scatters dropping on the reels will give you 5 free spins.\n\nWhat is the success rate of Multi Joker PopWins?\n\nThe success rate of Multi Joker PopWins is 4.59 and 4.17 with the Super Stake feature. If you are a fan of Megaways slots, I suggest trying Super Joker Megaways made by StakeLogic or one of the many titles (+75) by this provider directly on our list.\n            ",

In the standard version, each spin starts on a matrix consisting of 5 reels and 4 rows, allowing you to win from 2,048 ways. You can select bets from €0.20 up to €20.\n\nSymbols present in Multi Joker Popwins\n\nThe symbols used in Multi Joker PopWins are the same as those in Joker Drop PopWins, with the same values as before. Players can expect to come across the 10-A card suits of lower value and icons of cherries, limes, pears, plums, oranges, grapes, watermelons, and sevens as the more generous bunch.\n\nMulti Joker Popwins features\n\nThe PopWins mechanic is activated when you land a winning combination, and symbols that formed it are replaced with two new ones to increase the height of the corresponding reels and the number of ways to win. Reels have a maximum limit of 7 positions and are reset to their default size in the base game for the next spin. There are three meters that you can fill up in the base game: the Diamond Meter, Coin Meter, and the Free Spins feature. Activating the Super Stake will add Scatters to the reels during the free spins on reels 2, 3, and 4, and three Scatters will award +5 free spins.\n\nIntroduction to Multi Joker Popwins\n\nStakeLogic's Multi Joker PopWins is a remake of Joker Drop PopWins with modifications to the free spins multipliers, refresh on the features, and some small additions. The standard version starts on a matrix consisting of 5 reels and 4 rows, and you can activate the PopWins mechanic to increase the number of ways to win. The Diamond Meter, Coin Meter, and Free Spins feature are accessible in the base game. Players can also use the Super Stake to add Scatters to the reels during the free spins on reels 2, 3, and 4.\n\nConclusion\n\nMulti Joker PopWins is a highly volatile Fruit slot game with an RTP of 96.20% that allows players to win from 2,048 ways. The PopWins mechanic and the free spins are the standout features of this highly addictive game. Filling the Diamond Meter, Coin Meter, and the Free Spins feature in the base game could lead to life-changing payouts. StakeLogic has done it again with this fantastic remake.\n\nRecommended games\n\nIf you enjoyed Multi Joker PopWins, you might want to check out Super Joker Megaways made by StakeLogic or one of the many titles (+75) by the provider listed directly on our list.\n\n        \n            ",

It is a remake of the original game called Joker Drop PopWins. In this new version, you will find modifications to the free spins multipliers, a refresh on the features, and some small additions. Is it better, worse, or the same? It's time to find out in my review!\n\nMulti Joker Popwins: basic game details\n\nIn the standard version of this Fruit slot game, each spin starts on a matrix consisting of 5 reels and 4 rows, which increase when you get wins. At the default size, there are 2,048 ways to win paying from left to right. The highly volatile game with an RTP of 96.20% allows you to select bets from €0.20 up to €20.\n\nSymbols present in the new version Multi Joker Popwins\n\nThe same symbols used in Joker Drop PopWins are also used in this new gameplay, with the same values as before. There are the 10-A card suits of lower value and icons of cherries, limes, pears, plums, oranges, grapes, watermelons, and sevens as the more generous bunch.\n\nGet a five-win to receive 0.5/0.6 times the bet for the royals or 0.75x/5x the bet for five prizes. The wild can substitute any symbol except for the Scatter.\n\nMulti Joker PopWins: standard features and extra options\n\nThe PopWins mechanic, also playable from your iOS and Android mobile device, has been around for a while, but if you need an update, here's how it works. When a winning combination arrives, the symbols that formed it are removed and replaced with two new ones.\n\nNaturally, this increases the height of the corresponding reels, as well as the number of ways to win. The reels have a maximum limit of 7 positions and are reset to their default size in the base game for the next spin. When the reels have expanded to their maximum, winning symbols are replaced with a single new icon instead of two. Let's now see the features that can be activated during spins:\n\nDiamond Meter\n\nThe Diamond Meter is one of three meters that appear in the base game. Small diamond tokens can randomly appear above symbols and are collected in a meter when they land. Filling the meter with 5 diamonds in a single spin adds 5 wilds on reels 2, 3, and 4. At that point, the container is emptied, and spins are reset;\n\nCoin Meter\n\nEven the crown tokens randomly land on the main symbols and are collected. When the meter has been filled with 5 crown tokens in the same spin, coin symbols stop on the reels, revealing cash prizes, and the meter is emptied;\n\nFree Spins\n\nThe third meter is full when all five reels reach 7 positions high in the base game. When this happens, free spins are activated with assignments ranging from 8 to 15 FS from a wheel spin, plus a multiplier from a random wheel. Additionally, multiplier symbols with values up to x100 may appear, adding to the current win;\n\nSuper Stake\n\nBy activating the Super Stake, which doubles your bet, Scatter symbols are added to the reels during free spins on reels 2, 3, and 4. Getting 3 Scatter symbols assigns +5 free spins;\n\nBuy Bonus feature\n\nThis is a button that allows you to buy free spins. It comes with four choices, each of which assigns up to 15 free spins. With Super Stake turned off, the options are 100x, 200x, 400x, or 180x the total bet for multipliers up to x10, x15, x25, or a random win multiplier. Prices vary when Super Stake is active.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow much does buying a bonus cost in Multi Joker PopWins?\n\nThe higher the multiplier, the more expensive the bonus purchase will be. For free spins + 10x multiplier, you pay 100x your bet, for 15x multiplier, 200x, 25x multiplier costs 400x, and the random option costs 180x.\n\nCan I retrigger free spins in Multi Joker PopWins?\n\nYes, during the Free Spins feature, 3 Scatters dropping on the reels will give you 5 free spins.\n\nWhat is the success rate of Multi Joker PopWins?\n\nThe success rate of Multi Joker PopWins is 4.59 and 4.17 with the Super Stake feature. If you are a fan of Megaways slots, I suggest trying Super Joker Megaways made by StakeLogic or one of the many titles (+75) by this provider directly on our list.\n            ",

There are the 10-A card suits of lower value and icons of cherries, limes, pears, plums, oranges, grapes, watermelons, and sevens as the more generous bunch.\n\nGet a five-win to receive 0.5/0.6 times the bet for the royals or 0.75x/5x the bet for five prizes. The wild can substitute any symbol except for the Scatter.\n\nMulti Joker PopWins: standard features and extra options\n\nThe PopWins mechanic, also playable from your iOS and Android mobile device, has been around for a while, but if you need an update, here's how it works. When a winning combination arrives, the symbols that formed it are removed and replaced with two new ones.\n\nNaturally, this increases the height of the corresponding reels, as well as the number of ways to win. The reels have a maximum limit of 7 positions and are reset to their default size in the base game for the next spin. When the reels have expanded to their maximum, winning symbols are replaced with a single new icon instead of two. Let's now see the features that can be activated during spins:\n\nDiamond Meter\n\nThe Diamond Meter is one of three meters that appear in the base game. Small diamond tokens can randomly appear above symbols and are collected in a meter when they land. Filling the meter with 5 diamonds in a single spin adds 5 wilds on reels 2, 3, and 4. At that point, the container is emptied, and spins are reset;\n\nCoin Meter\n\nEven the crown tokens randomly land on the main symbols and are collected. When the meter has been filled with 5 crown tokens in the same spin, coin symbols stop on the reels, revealing cash prizes, and the meter is emptied;\n\nFree Spins\n\nThe third meter is full when all five reels reach 7 positions high in the base game. When this happens, free spins are activated with assignments ranging from 8 to 15 FS from a wheel spin, plus a multiplier from a random wheel. Additionally, multiplier symbols with values up to x100 may appear, adding to the current win;\n\nSuper Stake\n\nBy activating the Super Stake, which doubles your bet, Scatter symbols are added to the reels during free spins on reels 2, 3, and 4. Getting 3 Scatter symbols assigns +5 free spins;\n\nBuy Bonus feature\n\nThis is a button that allows you to buy free spins. It comes with four choices, each of which assigns up to 15 free spins. With Super Stake turned off, the options are 100x, 200x, 400x, or 180x the total bet for multipliers up to x10, x15, x25, or a random win multiplier. Prices vary when Super Stake is active.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow much does buying a bonus cost in Multi Joker PopWins?\n\nThe higher the multiplier, the more expensive the bonus purchase will be. For free spins + 10x multiplier, you pay 100x your bet, for 15x multiplier, 200x, 25x multiplier costs 400x, and the random option costs 180x.\n\nCan I retrigger free spins in Multi Joker PopWins?\n\nYes, during the Free Spins feature, 3 Scatters dropping on the reels will give you 5 free spins.\n\nWhat is the success rate of Multi Joker PopWins?\n\nThe success rate of Multi Joker PopWins is 4.59 and 4.17 with the Super Stake feature. If you are a fan of Megaways slots, I suggest trying Super Joker Megaways made by StakeLogic or one of the many titles (+75) by this provider directly on our list.\n            ",
