In Firebird Spirit, she is represented with her head adorned with feathers and a glittering golden armor.\n\nFrom a graphic point of view, there is nothing to complain about, the symbols are well designed and full of details, evoking the pre-colonial atmosphere that has always surrounded these civilizations. The amount of the three Jackpots is clearly visible on the left, while the Play, Autoplay and Bet Variator buttons are located at the bottom.\n\nLarge grid and many ways to win\n\nThe first thing that catches the eye is the extra large game grid, with 6 reels and 5 rows. There are 1,875 ways to win thanks to combinations of adjacent symbols starting from the first reel on the left and moving towards the right. Firebird Spirit is a game suitable for both beginners and more experienced players, as the betting range goes from a minimum of € 0.25 to a maximum of € 125. The minimum win is 4,250 times the bet.\n\nThe Autoplay function is present, which allows us to automatically spin the reels. The volatility is high, while the theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95%.\n\nThe new Connect & Collect function\n\nIn Firebird Spirit, we find several low-value symbols, such as playing cards, next to more rewarding Aztec symbols such as the snake, the frog and the lion. The goddess Chantico is the highest paying symbol of all. The bird is instead the Wild symbol, which replaces all symbols except the Connect & Collect symbol, represented by the inverted eight, the symbol of infinity. Some positions on reel three and the entire reel six are delimited by a frame, within which only special symbols appear. Creating a chain of Connect & Collect symbols that ends in one of these positions guarantees us the corresponding prize. The special prizes are:\n\nQuick Collect: Can only appear on reel three and practically guarantees that Connect & Collect symbols will appear on reels four and five to reach reel six.\n\nRespin: Appears only on reel three and gives 5 Respins. Connect & Collect symbols found during the bonus rounds remain on the reels until the end of the special game.\n\nCash prizes: A cash prize and a multiplier appear inside the shield.\n\nJackpot: One of the three available Jackpots appears.\n\nAdd Wild: Random Wilds are added.\n\nFree spins: A random number of Free Spins between 5 and 25 are awarded.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nIn Firebird Spirit, the RTP value is 95%.\n\nAre there any special bonuses or features?\n\nYes, there are six special bonuses and features related to the Connect & Collect symbol.\n\nCan I play on my tablet?\n\nCertainly, Firebird Spirit is available for every device, so you can play comfortably even on your tablet!\n            ",

In Firebird Spirit, she is represented with her head adorned with feathers and a glittering golden armor.\n\nFrom a graphic point of view, there is nothing to complain about, the symbols are well designed and full of details, evoking the pre-colonial atmosphere that has always surrounded these civilizations. The amount of the three Jackpots is clearly visible on the left, while the Play, Autoplay and Bet Variator buttons are located at the bottom.\n\nLarge grid and many ways to win\n\nThe first thing that catches the eye is the extra large game grid, with 6 reels and 5 rows. There are 1,875 ways to win thanks to combinations of adjacent symbols starting from the first reel on the left and moving towards the right. Firebird Spirit is a game suitable for both beginners and more experienced players, as the betting range goes from a minimum of € 0.25 to a maximum of € 125. The minimum win is 4,250 times the bet.\n\nThe Autoplay function is present, which allows us to automatically spin the reels. The volatility is high, while the theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95%.\n\nThe new Connect & Collect function\n\nIn Firebird Spirit, we find several low-value symbols, such as playing cards, next to more rewarding Aztec symbols such as the snake, the frog and the lion. The goddess Chantico is the highest paying symbol of all. The bird is instead the Wild symbol, which replaces all symbols except the Connect & Collect symbol, represented by the inverted eight, the symbol of infinity. Some positions on reel three and the entire reel six are delimited by a frame, within which only special symbols appear. Creating a chain of Connect & Collect symbols that ends in one of these positions guarantees us the corresponding prize. The special prizes are:\n\nQuick Collect: Can only appear on reel three and practically guarantees that Connect & Collect symbols will appear on reels four and five to reach reel six.\n\nRespin: Appears only on reel three and gives 5 Respins. Connect & Collect symbols found during the bonus rounds remain on the reels until the end of the special game.\n\nCash prizes: A cash prize and a multiplier appear inside the shield.\n\nJackpot: One of the three available Jackpots appears.\n\nAdd Wild: Random Wilds are added.\n\nFree spins: A random number of Free Spins between 5 and 25 are awarded.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nIn Firebird Spirit, the RTP value is 95%.\n\nAre there any special bonuses or features?\n\nYes, there are six special bonuses and features related to the Connect & Collect symbol.\n\nCan I play on my tablet?\n\nCertainly, Firebird Spirit is available for every device, so you can play comfortably even on your tablet!\n            ",

In Firebird Spirit, she is represented with her head adorned with feathers and a glittering golden armor.\n\nFrom a graphic point of view, there is nothing to complain about, the symbols are well designed and full of details, evoking the pre-colonial atmosphere that has always surrounded these civilizations. The amount of the three Jackpots is clearly visible on the left, while the Play, Autoplay and Bet Variator buttons are located at the bottom.\n\nLarge grid and many ways to win\n\nThe first thing that catches the eye is the extra large game grid, with 6 reels and 5 rows. There are 1,875 ways to win thanks to combinations of adjacent symbols starting from the first reel on the left and moving towards the right. Firebird Spirit is a game suitable for both beginners and more experienced players, as the betting range goes from a minimum of € 0.25 to a maximum of € 125. The minimum win is 4,250 times the bet.\n\nThe Autoplay function is present, which allows us to automatically spin the reels. The volatility is high, while the theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95%.\n\nThe new Connect & Collect function\n\nIn Firebird Spirit, we find several low-value symbols, such as playing cards, next to more rewarding Aztec symbols such as the snake, the frog and the lion. The goddess Chantico is the highest paying symbol of all. The bird is instead the Wild symbol, which replaces all symbols except the Connect & Collect symbol, represented by the inverted eight, the symbol of infinity. Some positions on reel three and the entire reel six are delimited by a frame, within which only special symbols appear. Creating a chain of Connect & Collect symbols that ends in one of these positions guarantees us the corresponding prize. The special prizes are:\n\nQuick Collect: Can only appear on reel three and practically guarantees that Connect & Collect symbols will appear on reels four and five to reach reel six.\n\nRespin: Appears only on reel three and gives 5 Respins. Connect & Collect symbols found during the bonus rounds remain on the reels until the end of the special game.\n\nCash prizes: A cash prize and a multiplier appear inside the shield.\n\nJackpot: One of the three available Jackpots appears.\n\nAdd Wild: Random Wilds are added.\n\nFree spins: A random number of Free Spins between 5 and 25 are awarded.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nIn Firebird Spirit, the RTP value is 95%.\n\nAre there any special bonuses or features?\n\nYes, there are six special bonuses and features related to the Connect & Collect symbol.\n\nCan I play on my tablet?\n\nCertainly, Firebird Spirit is available for every device, so you can play comfortably even on your tablet!\n        ",
