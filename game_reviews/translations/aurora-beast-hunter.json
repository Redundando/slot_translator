Created by Just for the Win and Microgaming, it is a 5-reel and 40-payline game, with many extras. In addition to standard wilds, you can also hit expanding or stacked wilds. Trigger the bonus round and you'll have the chance to choose from 3 different free spin features that allow you to choose low, medium, or high variance. With a loud soundtrack, discover what else is on offer in our review of Aurora Beast Hunter.\n\nA retro graphic design\nAs for the graphic design, JustForTheWin has landed Miss Aurora on an arid prairie that offers nothing but rocks and the reel-set. At least that's the landscape in the background, which appears immobile but only to make room for a fairly dynamic gameplay.\n\nEach spin results in a smooth rotation of the reels, which can trigger wins made up of two categories of symbols: high-yielding image symbols and low-yielding card symbols. Wilds lead to bursts of energy, as they have Aurora on them and she's ready to leap.\n\nAurora Beast Hunter slot is on a mission to hunt down wild beasts and cause explosions on the reel-set. In both cases, they are followed by cash wins that are marked by more fire on the reels.\n\nThere is a retro feel to the animated images of the Aurora Beast Hunter slot. It could come straight from an animated television adventure and is bright, colorful, and very bold. The action on the screen is backed up by a loud, raucous, and heavy metal soundtrack. If this is your thing, great. But it made us reach for the mute button.\n\nWith a desert canyon in the background, you'll see lower-value playing card symbols alongside an assortment of weapon symbols. Aurora is the most rewarding symbol. It can appear in stacks of 1, 3, or 4 high symbols and pays 1.2, 3.5, or 12.5 x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline.\n\nIn addition to a standard wild, you'll find a selection of other wilds hanging around the reels. They're all in the shape of creatures of some sort. They replace all standard symbols. The treasure coin is an expanding wild that can land on reels 1, 3, and 5. When it hits, it transforms the entire reel into a wild. Jewel Jaws is a stacked wild that can only appear on reels 2 and 4.\n\nVisually, Aurora Beast Hunter is excellent. The soundtrack, not so much. It can be played on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nYour adventure in the game can begin as soon as you pack your laser guns and enough money for at least a handful of spins, and maybe even more, because the game can accept bets that are quite low. To start the reels, press the spin button, which is the big, round one in the bottom right area of the screen.\n\nThree more buttons are lined up in the same area: menu, autoplay, and a poker chip that represents bets. Select your bet from the available amounts on the grid. As we said, the smallest bet is 10 cents and there are more low bets that increase with large and small increments, ending with a maximum bet of €50.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter slot can be played with automatic spins. Press the corresponding button to open the menu and then select one of the preset automatic spin options. The game starts to roll in this way, however, optional settings include the addition of one or two stops, which help keep track of balance spending.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter slot is played on 5 reels with 40 paylines that appear as 3x4x3x4x4x3. To get a win, you need 3 or more matching symbols from left to right across the subsequent reels, starting from reel 1, of course.\n\nYou can play at stake levels ranging from 10 cents to €50 per spin. You can set up to 100 auto spins, but there are no options for win and loss limits. However, there is the quickplay mode if required.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter RTP is a solid 96.27%. Despite the fact that you can vary the volatility in the free spins around overall variance is high. The success rate is about 1 in every 5 spins (20.58%). The maximum win is 5000x your bet, which is provided in the Sub Free Spins feature. On each base game spin, the maximum win is 500x your bet.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the retro theme, you should try NetEnt's Street Fighter 2 slot, based on the iconic video game. It's a 5-reel, 5-row game with a Cluster Pays mechanic. Based on the iconic video game, you can play from as little as 20 cents per spin on all devices.

Wilds lead to bursts of energy, as they have Aurora on them and she's ready to leap.\n\nAurora Beast Hunter slot is on a mission to hunt down wild beasts and cause explosions on the reel-set. In both cases, they are followed by cash wins that are marked by more fire on the reels.\n\nThere is a retro feel to the animated images of the Aurora Beast Hunter slot. It could come straight from an animated television adventure and is bright, colorful, and very bold. The action on the screen is backed up by a loud, raucous, and heavy metal soundtrack. If this is your thing, great. But it made us reach for the mute button.\n\nWith a desert canyon in the background, you'll see lower-value playing card symbols alongside an assortment of weapon symbols. Aurora is the most rewarding symbol. It can appear in stacks of 1, 3, or 4 high symbols and pays 1.2, 3.5, or 12.5 x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline.\n\nIn addition to a standard wild, you'll find a selection of other wilds hanging around the reels. They're all in the shape of creatures of some sort. They replace all standard symbols. The treasure coin is an expanding wild that can land on reels 1, 3, and 5. When it hits, it transforms the entire reel into a wild. Jewel Jaws is a stacked wild that can only appear on reels 2 and 4.\n\nVisually, Aurora Beast Hunter is excellent. The soundtrack, not so much. It can be played on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nYour adventure in the game can begin as soon as you pack your laser guns and enough money for at least a handful of spins, and maybe even more, because the game can accept bets that are quite low. To start the reels, press the spin button, which is the big, round one in the bottom right area of the screen.\n\nThree more buttons are lined up in the same area: menu, autoplay, and a poker chip that represents bets. Select your bet from the available amounts on the grid. As we said, the smallest bet is 10 cents and there are more low bets that increase with large and small increments, ending with a maximum bet of €50.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter slot can be played with automatic spins. Press the corresponding button to open the menu and then select one of the preset automatic spin options. The game starts to roll in this way, however, optional settings include the addition of one or two stops, which help keep track of balance spending.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter slot is played on 5 reels with 40 paylines that appear as 3x4x3x4x4x3. To get a win, you need 3 or more matching symbols from left to right across the subsequent reels, starting from reel 1, of course.\n\nYou can play at stake levels ranging from 10 cents to €50 per spin. You can set up to 100 auto spins, but there are no options for win and loss limits. However, there is the quickplay mode if required.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter RTP is a solid 96.27%. Despite the fact that you can vary the volatility in the free spins around overall variance is high. The success rate is about 1 in every 5 spins (20.58%). The maximum win is 5000x your bet, which is provided in the Sub Free Spins feature. On each base game spin, the maximum win is 500x your bet.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the retro theme, you should try NetEnt's Street Fighter 2 slot, based on the iconic video game. It's a 5-reel, 5-row game with a Cluster Pays mechanic. Based on the iconic video game, you can play from as little as 20 cents per spin on all devices. It comes with 8 different characters, each of which offers their own Wild Combo function."

With a loud soundtrack, discover what else is on offer in our review of Aurora Beast Hunter.\n\nA retro graphic design\nAs for the graphic design, JustForTheWin has landed Miss Aurora on an arid prairie that offers nothing but rocks and the reel-set. At least that's the landscape in the background, which appears immobile but only to make room for a fairly dynamic gameplay.\n\nEach spin results in a smooth rotation of the reels, which can trigger wins made up of two categories of symbols: high-yielding image symbols and low-yielding card symbols. Wilds lead to bursts of energy, as they have Aurora on them and she's ready to leap.\n\nAurora Beast Hunter slot is on a mission to hunt down wild beasts and cause explosions on the reel-set. In both cases, they are followed by cash wins that are marked by more fire on the reels.\n\nThere is a retro feel to the animated images of the Aurora Beast Hunter slot. It could come straight from an animated television adventure and is bright, colorful, and very bold. The action on the screen is backed up by a loud, raucous, and heavy metal soundtrack. If this is your thing, great. But it made us reach for the mute button.\n\nWith a desert canyon in the background, you'll see lower-value playing card symbols alongside an assortment of weapon symbols. Aurora is the most rewarding symbol. It can appear in stacks of 1, 3, or 4 high symbols and pays 1.2, 3.5, or 12.5 x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline.\n\nIn addition to a standard wild, you'll find a selection of other wilds hanging around the reels. They're all in the shape of creatures of some sort. They replace all standard symbols. The treasure coin is an expanding wild that can land on reels 1, 3, and 5. When it hits, it transforms the entire reel into a wild. Jewel Jaws is a stacked wild that can only appear on reels 2 and 4.\n\nVisually, Aurora Beast Hunter is excellent. The soundtrack, not so much. It can be played on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nYour adventure in the game can begin as soon as you pack your laser guns and enough money for at least a handful of spins, and maybe even more, because the game can accept bets that are quite low. To start the reels, press the spin button, which is the big, round one in the bottom right area of the screen.\n\nThree more buttons are lined up in the same area: menu, autoplay, and a poker chip that represents bets. Select your bet from the available amounts on the grid. As we said, the smallest bet is 10 cents and there are more low bets that increase with large and small increments, ending with a maximum bet of €50.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter slot can be played with automatic spins. Press the corresponding button to open the menu and then select one of the preset automatic spin options. The game starts to roll in this way, however, optional settings include the addition of one or two stops, which help keep track of balance spending.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter slot is played on 5 reels with 40 paylines that appear as 3x4x3x4x4x3. To get a win, you need 3 or more matching symbols from left to right across the subsequent reels, starting from reel 1, of course.\n\nYou can play at stake levels ranging from 10 cents to €50 per spin. You can set up to 100 auto spins, but there are no options for win and loss limits. However, there is the quickplay mode if required.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter RTP is a solid 96.27%. Despite the fact that you can vary the volatility in the free spins around overall variance is high. The success rate is about 1 in every 5 spins (20.58%). The maximum win is 5000x your bet, which is provided in the Sub Free Spins feature. On each base game spin, the maximum win is 500x your bet.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the retro theme, you should try NetEnt's Street Fighter 2 slot, based on the iconic video game. It's a 5-reel, 5-row game with a Cluster Pays mechanic. Based on the iconic video game, you can play from as little as 20 cents per spin on all devices. It comes with 8 different characters, each of which offers their own Wild Combo function.\n            ",

And let's not forget about the wilds and bonus rounds!</p>\n                \n                <p>The wilds in Aurora Beast Hunter come in three different varieties: standard, expanding, and stacked. That means that there are plenty of opportunities for big wins, especially when you hit one of those expanding or stacked wilds.</p>\n                \n                <p>But perhaps the best part of Aurora Beast Hunter is the bonus round. This is where the real action happens. When you trigger the bonus round, you'll be presented with three different free spin features, each with its own level of variance. It's like having three mini-games in one!</p>\n                \n                <p>Choose the low variance spins feature if you're looking for some steady wins. But if you're feeling lucky and want to take a chance, go for the high variance option. Of course, the medium variance feature is a happy medium between the two.</p>\n\n                <p>But one thing's for sure: no matter which feature you choose, you're in for a wild ride. And trust us, we mean that literally. After all, this is a game about hunting beasts. Who wouldn't want to go on a wild ride while doing that?</p>\n                \n                <p>Overall, we loved playing Aurora Beast Hunter. The graphics are great, the gameplay is exciting, and the chance to choose your own variance level in the bonus round is a real game changer. Give this game a try and see if you have what it takes to take down the beast.</p>\"\n}"

Wins are earned with at least three matching symbols on the five reels. Players can spin for the chance to win with a minimum of 10 cents per spin on a game that is high variance, has a theoretical return to player of 96.27%, and that can pay up to 5000x multiplied by the winning bet.\n\nJoin a 90s-style animated adventurer on a hunt for desert riches in the Aurora Beast Hunter slot. Created by Just for the Win and Microgaming, it is a 5-reel and 40-payline game, with many extras. In addition to standard wilds, you can also hit expanding or stacked wilds. Trigger the bonus round and you'll have the chance to choose from 3 different free spin features that allow you to choose low, medium, or high variance. With a loud soundtrack, discover what else is on offer in our review of Aurora Beast Hunter.\n\nA retro graphic design\nAs for the graphic design, JustForTheWin has landed Miss Aurora on an arid prairie that offers nothing but rocks and the reel-set. At least that's the landscape in the background, which appears immobile but only to make room for a fairly dynamic gameplay.\n\nEach spin results in a smooth rotation of the reels, which can trigger wins made up of two categories of symbols: high-yielding image symbols and low-yielding card symbols. Wilds lead to bursts of energy, as they have Aurora on them and she's ready to leap.\n\nAurora Beast Hunter slot is on a mission to hunt down wild beasts and cause explosions on the reel-set. In both cases, they are followed by cash wins that are marked by more fire on the reels.\n\nThere is a retro feel to the animated images of the Aurora Beast Hunter slot. It could come straight from an animated television adventure and is bright, colorful, and very bold. The action on the screen is backed up by a loud, raucous, and heavy metal soundtrack. If this is your thing, great. But it made us reach for the mute button.\n\nWith a desert canyon in the background, you'll see lower-value playing card symbols alongside an assortment of weapon symbols. Aurora is the most rewarding symbol. It can appear in stacks of 1, 3, or 4 high symbols and pays 1.2, 3.5, or 12.5 x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline.\n\nIn addition to a standard wild, you'll find a selection of other wilds hanging around the reels. They're all in the shape of creatures of some sort. They replace all standard symbols. The treasure coin is an expanding wild that can land on reels 1, 3, and 5. When it hits, it transforms the entire reel into a wild. Jewel Jaws is a stacked wild that can only appear on reels 2 and 4.\n\nVisually, Aurora Beast Hunter is excellent. The soundtrack, not so much. It can be played on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nYour adventure in the game can begin as soon as you pack your laser guns and enough money for at least a handful of spins, and maybe even more, because the game can accept bets that are quite low. To start the reels, press the spin button, which is the big, round one in the bottom right area of the screen.\n\nThree more buttons are lined up in the same area: menu, autoplay, and a poker chip that represents bets. Select your bet from the available amounts on the grid. As we said, the smallest bet is 10 cents and there are more low bets that increase with large and small increments, ending with a maximum bet of €50.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter slot can be played with automatic spins. Press the corresponding button to open the menu and then select one of the preset automatic spin options. The game starts to roll in this way, however, optional settings include the addition of one or two stops, which help keep track of balance spending.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter slot is played on 5 reels with 40 paylines that appear as 3x4x3x4x4x3. To get a win, you need 3 or more matching symbols from left to right across the subsequent reels, starting from reel 1, of course.\n\nYou can play at stake levels ranging from 10 cents to €50 per spin. You can set up to 100 auto spins, but there are no options for win and loss limits. However, there is the quickplay mode if required.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter RTP is a solid 96.27%. Despite the fact that you can vary the volatility in the free spins around overall variance is high. The success rate is about 1 in every 5 spins (20.58%). The maximum win is 5000x your bet, which is provided in the Sub Free Spins feature. On each base game spin, the maximum win is 500x your bet.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the retro theme, you should try NetEnt's Street Fighter 2 slot, based on the iconic video game. It's a 5-reel, 5-row game with a Cluster Pays mechanic. Based on the iconic video game, you can play from as little as 20 cents per spin on all devices. It comes with 8 different characters, each of which offers their own Wild Combo function.\n            ",

Wins are earned with at least three matching symbols on the five reels. Players can spin for the chance to win with a minimum of 10 cents per spin on a game that is high variance, has a theoretical return to player of 96.27%, and that can pay up to 5000x multiplied by the winning bet.\n\nJoin a 90s-style animated adventurer on a hunt for desert riches in the Aurora Beast Hunter slot. Created by Just for the Win and Microgaming, it is a 5-reel and 40-payline game, with many extras. In addition to standard wilds, you can also hit expanding or stacked wilds. Trigger the bonus round and you'll have the chance to choose from 3 different free spin features that allow you to choose low, medium, or high variance. With a loud soundtrack, discover what else is on offer in our review of Aurora Beast Hunter.\n\nA retro graphic design\nAs for the graphic design, JustForTheWin has landed Miss Aurora on an arid prairie that offers nothing but rocks and the reel-set. At least that's the landscape in the background, which appears immobile but only to make room for a fairly dynamic gameplay.\n\nEach spin results in a smooth rotation of the reels, which can trigger wins made up of two categories of symbols: high-yielding image symbols and low-yielding card symbols. Wilds lead to bursts of energy, as they have Aurora on them and she's ready to leap.\n\nAurora Beast Hunter slot is on a mission to hunt down wild beasts and cause explosions on the reel-set. In both cases, they are followed by cash wins that are marked by more fire on the reels.\n\nThere is a retro feel to the animated images of the Aurora Beast Hunter slot. It could come straight from an animated television adventure and is bright, colorful, and very bold. The action on the screen is backed up by a loud, raucous, and heavy metal soundtrack. If this is your thing, great. But it made us reach for the mute button.\n\nWith a desert canyon in the background, you'll see lower-value playing card symbols alongside an assortment of weapon symbols. Aurora is the most rewarding symbol. It can appear in stacks of 1, 3, or 4 high symbols and pays 1.2, 3.5, or 12.5 x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline.\n\nIn addition to a standard wild, you'll find a selection of other wilds hanging around the reels. They're all in the shape of creatures of some sort. They replace all standard symbols. The treasure coin is an expanding wild that can land on reels 1, 3, and 5. When it hits, it transforms the entire reel into a wild. Jewel Jaws is a stacked wild that can only appear on reels 2 and 4.\n\nVisually, Aurora Beast Hunter is excellent. The soundtrack, not so much. It can be played on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nYour adventure in the game can begin as soon as you pack your laser guns and enough money for at least a handful of spins, and maybe even more, because the game can accept bets that are quite low. To start the reels, press the spin button, which is the big, round one in the bottom right area of the screen.\n\nThree more buttons are lined up in the same area: menu, autoplay, and a poker chip that represents bets. Select your bet from the available amounts on the grid. As we said, the smallest bet is 10 cents and there are more low bets that increase with large and small increments, ending with a maximum bet of €50.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter slot can be played with automatic spins. Press the corresponding button to open the menu and then select one of the preset automatic spin options. The game starts to roll in this way, however, optional settings include the addition of one or two stops, which help keep track of balance spending.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter slot is played on 5 reels with 40 paylines that appear as 3x4x3x4x4x3. To get a win, you need 3 or more matching symbols from left to right across the subsequent reels, starting from reel 1, of course.\n\nYou can play at stake levels ranging from 10 cents to €50 per spin. You can set up to 100 auto spins, but there are no options for win and loss limits. However, there is the quickplay mode if required.\n\nThe Aurora Beast Hunter RTP is a solid 96.27%. Despite the fact that you can vary the volatility in the free spins around overall variance is high. The success rate is about 1 in every 5 spins (20.58%). The maximum win is 5000x your bet, which is provided in the Sub Free Spins feature. On each base game spin, the maximum win is 500x your bet.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the retro theme, you should try NetEnt's Street Fighter 2 slot, based on the iconic video game. It's a 5-reel, 5-row game with a Cluster Pays mechanic. Based on the iconic video game, you can play from as little as 20 cents per spin on all devices. It comes with 8 different characters, each of which offers their own Wild Combo function.\n            ",
