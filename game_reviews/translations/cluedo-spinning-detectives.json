Il proprietario della casa, il dottor Black, viene assassinato e tutti coloro che occupavano la dimora in quel momento sono potenziali indiziati. In questo gioco vince chi risolve il caso, indovinando chi è l’assassino, in quale stanza si è compiuto l’omicidio e quale è stata l’arma del delitto.\nCluedo Spinning Detectives riprende molto fedelmente il noto gioco, sia come grafica che come simbologia. Le linee sono molto asciutte ma nel complesso il compartimento grafico risulta essere molto efficace e dà davvero la sensazione di trovarsi nel gioco originale in versione online.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot\nCluedo Spinning Detectives ha una struttura di gioco molto particolare, in quanto a seconda dei simboli che compaiono nella schermata principale, il gioco si sposta in una delle cinque stanze (a differenza delle 9 nel gioco da tavolo) della Tudor Hall, secondo il seguente schema:\n\nSERRA (CONSERVATORY) – Rullo 1\nSALA DA BILIARDO (BILLIARD ROOM) – Rullo 2\nBIBLIOTECA (LIBRARY) – Rullo 3\nCUCINA (KITCHEN) – Rullo 4\nSALA DA PRANZO (DINING ROOM) – Rullo 5\n\nOgnuna di queste cinque stanze si caratterizza poi per una diversa funzionalità, con bonus e tanti giri gratuiti oltre che, ovviamente, con numerose e variegate possibilità di vincita.\nParlando invece in termini più generici, vediamo che Cluedo Spinning Detectives presenta una struttura di base caratterizzata da cinque rulli e 40 linee di pagamento.\nLa volatilità di questa slot machine è piuttosto alta e ciò si traduce da una parte in vincite non troppo frequenti, dall’altra in premi che potranno raggiungere anche delle cifre di tutto rispetto.\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP) di Cluedo Spinning Detectives è stabilito al 96,06%.

The game is set in a house called \"Tudor Hall,\" depicted on a board divided into nine rooms. The owner of the house, Dr. Black, is murdered, and all those who were in the house at the time are potential suspects. The winner is the one who solves the case, guessing who the killer is, in which room the murder occurred, and what was the murder weapon.\n\nCluedo Spinning Detectives faithfully captures the famous game in both graphics and symbolism. The lines are minimalistic, but overall, the graphics are effective, giving players the sensation that they are playing the original board game online. \n\nThe slot game has a unique gameplay structure where, depending on the symbols that appear on the main screen, the game moves to one of five rooms in Tudor Hall, instead of nine in the board game. These rooms have different functionalities, such as bonuses and free spins, providing numerous and varied possibilities for players to win. Additionally, the game structure is five reels and 40 pay lines, offering high volatility and prizes that can reach impressive numbers.\n\nThe return to player (RTP) ratio of Cluedo Spinning Detectives is set at 96.06%, which is not an extraordinary percentage, but it is acceptable, in line with most online slot games. Furthermore, the game's symbols consist of both thematic and royal symbols, with the thematic ones being loyal to the dynamics of the board game, such as the magnifying glass, the Stanze Bonus logo, the interrogation point, and the Clue logo, serving as the wild symbol that can replace any other symbol to complete a winning combination.\n\nIn conclusion, Cluedo Spinning Detectives is a fun and unconventional game that deviates from traditional slot machines due to its original and intricate gameplay. It is recommended for experienced gamblers who are looking for big wins and do not settle for frequent small prizes.\n        ",
