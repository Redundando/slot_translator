The graphics are simple and straightforward, with accurate replication of the symbols and the skyline of a dark city that serves as the backdrop of the game. While there are no extravagant special effects or 3D animations, the dark cyberpunk theme of the game is consistent and enhances the theme of crime that the game is based on.\n\nSymbols\n\nCrime City features a mix of thematic and classic symbols. The thematic symbols are represented by a badge, a gun, a whiskey glass, and handcuffs that pay out up to 100x to 500x the bet when landing on all five reels. The classic symbols are the Royals, i.e., numbers and letters from J to Ace, represented with neon graphics. While the Royals are not entirely themed, they effectively contribute to the overall cyberpunk theme of the game.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nCrime City features three special symbols that are designed to boost players' winnings. The Wild symbol is represented by a singer and acts as a wild card, substituting for all other symbols except for the Scatter and Bonus symbols. The Scatter is a gangster and pays out free spins plus multipliers of up to 50x the bet when landing at least three times on the reels. Finally, the Bonus symbol is a target that grants access to the Bonus game, where players can enjoy additional chances to win big.\n\nBetting Options\n\nCrime City offers a flexible and inclusive betting range, making the game accessible to players of various budgets. The game offers a range from a minimum of €0.25 to a maximum of €50 per spin, with a token value that ranges from one cent to €2. Players can adjust their bets on each spin by choosing the number of coins per line and the cash value of each coin. Overall, Crime City's betting options provide players with plenty of choices to tailor their betting strategy to their playing style.\n\n        \n            ",

Specifically, concerning the graphic department, the Italian software house Tuko Productions once again offers a slot machine that does not amaze us with special effects or sophisticated 3D animations but rather focuses on the solidity of the gameplay more than the aesthetic aspect.\nTherefore, the graphics are essential and straightforward, with the skyline of a dark city that serves as a background to the reels and symbols that are reproduced accurately but without seeking the \"wow effect.\"\nOverview of Crime City\nTuko Productions always stands out for the great solidity of its products, developed with easy and intuitive gameplay suitable even for those who are less experienced in slot games. To help those who are beginners, a handy guide and a payment table are always present, allowing you to preview the value of each symbol.\nPlaying Crime City is very simple: it is a slot machine with five reels and 243 ways to win, with a betting range from a minimum of €0.25 on all lines up to a maximum of €50 and a token value ranging from one cent to €2.\nIt is also possible to play Crime City in Autoplay mode, by setting the number of spins through the buttons found at the bottom of the game screen and comfortably letting the reels spin by themselves!\nThis slot machine offers a theoretical return to the player (return to player or RTP) that stands at a good 96.4%, in line with most games that can be found in online casinos.\nSymbols and special features of Crime City\nUsually, Tuko has accustomed us to entirely themed symbols for its slots, but with Crime City, it changes its modus operandi by introducing the so-called Royals, i.e., the numbers and letters of playing cards, in this case, from J to Ace, reproduced with neon graphics.\nIn addition to these, we have a badge that pays up to 500 times the bet and is the symbol with the highest value, the gun that allows you to win up to 200 times the bet and the whiskey glass and handcuffs that reach 100x when they appear on all five reels.\nThen there are three special symbols: the Wild, represented by a singer and acting as a wild card, the gangster who is the Scatter and gives free spins and multipliers if it appears at least three times, and the Bonus symbol, a target that allows access to the Bonus game.\n            ",
