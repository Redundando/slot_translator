It's a 5-reel and 20-payline slot game that can be played on your mobile device. You can bet as little as 20 cents per spin, or as much as 200 euros if you're feeling lucky.\n\nThe game is based on Norse mythology and features stunning graphics and sound effects. The Avalanche feature allows you to win multiple times in a single spin, adding to the excitement.\n\nBut the real attraction of Asgardian Stones is the Bonus Wheel, a Wheel of Fortune-style feature where you can win cash prizes and up to 15 free spins! During the free spins, you can benefit from the cascading symbols that remain \"locked\" on the reels for the next spin if they don't result in a win.\n\nDespite the beautiful and realistic background, the symbols in Asgardian Stones are a bit less elaborate. The stone faces represent the thematic symbols, distinguished only by their color. The green and orange faces pay the most. The numbers and letters of playing cards from 9 to Ace are also represented, carved into stone. These are the symbols that pay the least.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by a simple W, and the Scatter symbol is replaced by the Bonus Wheel. There are several special features to enjoy in this slot machine game, including the Cascading Symbols, Colossal Symbols, and the Bonus Wheel.\n\nIn summary, Asgardian Stones is a well-designed slot game with an immersive gameplay system, offering wins of up to 2,000 times your bet. So, why not enjoy the thrill of the game and try your luck today?",
