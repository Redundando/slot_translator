In the past, these types of boats were floating casinos, hosting the elite of high society who clandestinely tried their luck. The vintage atmosphere brings players back in time, sipping whiskey with beautiful women while seeking fortune! The graphics are incredibly elegant and the sound design is immersive, offering a thrilling gaming experience!\n\nSymbols and special features\nThe symbols in this slot are centered around old land-based casinos, featuring chips, dice, and of course, beautiful women. Alongside these, as per Novomatic tradition, the classic poker cards from 9 to Ace appear and blend perfectly with the other symbols. The Wild symbol, represented by a woman, helps players complete winning combinations by substituting for all other symbols, except for the Scatter. Additionally, when the Wild symbol appears three times, players receive a payout irrespective of the position on the reels. Unlike the other symbols, which must be aligned from left to right. The River Queen Scatter symbol not only helps determine winning combinations but also gives players access to 10 bonus games in the \"Moving Wild-Feature\" mode when it appears three or more times on any position on the reels.\n\nTo gamble or not to gamble?\nAre you a daring gambler who loves to take risks? Well then, the Gamble feature is perfect for you! In almost all of Novomatic's slot games, players can double their winnings through a bonus game that is not for the faint of heart! After any win, the \"Gamble\" button appears on the screen, and players can choose to gamble their winnings by guessing the colour of a face-down card. If the guess is correct, players double their winnings; otherwise, they lose their entire initial win.\n\nSimilar slots\nRiver Queen stands out due to its unique exploration of the theme of old land-based casinos and gaming halls, which is common in online slot machines.

The game features the Moving Wild-Feature mode, which gives players access to 10 bonus games when the Scatter symbol appears three or more times on any position on the reels. Additionally, players can activate the Gamble feature to double their winnings through a bonus game that is not for the faint of heart.\n\nTheme and Design\n\nRiver Queen takes players on a ride on an old steam boat, travelling the great rivers of the American South. The vintage atmosphere brings players back in time to the golden age of floating casinos, providing an immersive gaming experience. The graphics are elegant, which blends perfectly with the overall ambience. The sound design is also captivating, providing an excellent audio experience.\n\nSymbols and Bonuses\n\nThe symbols in River Queen are centered around old land-based casinos, featuring chips, dice, and beautiful women. The classic poker cards from 9 to Ace also appear alongside these symbols. The Wild symbol, represented by a woman, helps players complete winning combinations by substituting for all other symbols, except for the Scatter. Additionally, when the Wild symbol appears three times, players receive a payout irrespective of the position on the reels. The Scatter symbol not only helps determine winning combinations, but it also gives players access to 10 bonus games in the Moving Wild-Feature mode when it appears three or more times on any position on the reels.\n\nGamble Feature\n\nRiver Queen features a Gamble feature that allows daring gamblers to double their winnings through a bonus game that is triggered after any win. The game involves guessing the colour of a face-down card. If the guess is correct, players double their winnings; otherwise, they lose their entire initial win. This feature is not for the faint of heart and requires players to risk their winnings.\n\nComparison to Other Slots\n\nRiver Queen stands out from other slot games due to its unique exploration of the theme of old land-based casinos and gaming halls, which is not common in online slot machines. While almost all software providers offer slot games in this old school category of slots, the Fruit Machine game is the most popular. The Fruit Machine features fruit symbols such as cherries, watermelons, bananas, and lemons, accompanied by the famous BAR sign, the number 7, and the Liberty Bell, paying homage to the first land-based slot machine. Some examples of similar slots games to River Queen include Fruit Shop, Jolly Fruits, and Spin or Reels.\n\n        \n            ",
