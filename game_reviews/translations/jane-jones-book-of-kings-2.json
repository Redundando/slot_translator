Parliamo di Jane Jones: Book of Kings 2, che è una vera certezza per i gamer appassionati di viaggi e belle grafiche. In questo viaggio verso l’Himalaya ci si trova di fronte a una struttura con 5 rulli e 10 linee di pagamento e una serie di bonus e funzionalità che meritano di essere provate. Con 2 scatter, quando ci si trova in modalità notturna si può provare la funzione Night Free Games che è caratterizzata da uno speciale simbolo in espansione. Mentre se giochi nella modalità giorno avrai un’icona diversa che sfrutta sempre la meccanica dell’espansione. Portano tutte e due alla vincita di giri gratuiti illimitati che sono indiscutibilmente la scelta migliore quando si parla di macchinette. Ma scopriamo di più su tale slot che ha un RTP fissato al 96,5%, capace di offrire fino a 4.000x della scommessa per ogni giro.\nLa grafica della slot\nIn questo sequel la nostra affascinante avventuriera Jane Jones si trova pronta a tutto e in procinto di muoversi verso l’antico Egitto. Alle spalle della griglia di gioco troviamo l’Himalaya, con montagne innevate e templi buddisti che hanno davvero un’ottima resa grafica. Il tema è approfondito grazie ai simboli che spaziano dalle classiche carte reali che sono A, K, Q, J e 10 con un valore basso. Si passa poi alle divinità buddista in oro, un ciondolo, un budda e ovviamente l’immancabile e sexy Jane Jones. E’ lei il simbolo più remunerativo e permette di pagare 1, 8, 40 o 400 volte la tua puntata se appare 2, 3, 4 o 5 volte in un giro. Come detto sono poi previsti dei simboli per la modalità Giorno e Notte che sono degli Scatter di cui parleremo nel prossimo capitolo legato alle sue funzioni bonus.\nFunzionalità speciali\nPartiamo dalla Night Mode che si apre con l’atterraggio di soli 2 scatter, come nel caso della Day Free Games. Il giocatore ha la possibilità di avere giri gratuiti illimitati in cui sarà centrale la funzione del simbolo in espansione che può arrivare a coprire l’intera griglia. Il gioco base di Book of Kings 2 parte proprio dal Giorno e potrai sbloccare la notte in modo del tutto casuale.\nIl Day Free Games si gioca nel momento in cui hai tre o più simboli jolly sui rulli che potranno atterrare solo in modalità giorno: con 3, 4 o 5 potrai vincere 2, 20 o 200x la tua puntata totale. Può sembrare complicato capire il passaggio tra le due funzionalità fin dalla prima partita, ma diventerà tutto molto comprensibile e intuitivo giocando.\nConsiderazioni finali su Jane Jones: Book of Kings 2\nA livello grafico la slot è veramente impeccabile e ben curata, purtroppo però non ci piace l’assenza di un accompagnamento sonoro che possa avvolgere e coinvolgere il giocatore nell’azione di gioco. Ma questo è un dettaglio soggettivo che per molti potrebbe non creare alcun problema. Sono interessanti le sue 2 modalità, i 2 scatter in espansione e le vittorie che possono generare con i giri gratuiti offerti senza limiti. Cerca di tenere un occhio sulla bella Jane Jones per riuscire così a innescare una vincita pari a 4.000 volte la tua puntata finale.\n",

We're talking about Jane Jones: Book of Kings 2, which is a sure bet for gamers who love travel and beautiful graphics. In this journey to the Himalayas, you'll find yourself facing a structure with 5 reels and 10 pay lines, along with a range of bonuses and features that are worth trying. With 2 scatters, when you're in night mode, you can try the Night Free Games function that's characterized by a special expanding symbol. While playing in daylight mode, you'll have a different icon that also uses the expanding mechanic. Both lead to unlimited free spins, which are undoubtedly the best choice when it comes to slot machines. But let's find out more about this slot game that has an RTP set at 96.5%, and can offer up to 4,000x your bet for each spin.\n\nSlot Graphics\nIn this sequel, our charming adventurer Jane Jones is ready for anything and about to move to ancient Egypt. Behind the game grid, you'll find the Himalayas, with snow-capped mountains and Buddhist temples that have excellent graphics. The theme is deepened thanks to symbols that range from classic royal cards such as A, K, Q, J, and 10 with a low value. Then there are Buddhist deities in gold, a pendant, a Buddha, and of course, the unmissable and sexy Jane Jones. She is the most profitable symbol and pays 1, 8, 40, or 400 times your bet if it appears 2, 3, 4, or 5 times in one spin. As mentioned, there are also symbols for Day and Night mode that are Scatters, which we'll talk about in the next section related to its bonus features.\n\nSpecial Features\nLet's start with Night Mode, which opens with the landing of only 2 scatters, just like Day Free Games. The player has the opportunity to have unlimited free spins, with the central function of the expanding symbol that can cover the entire grid. The base game of Book of Kings 2 starts with Day, and you can randomly unlock Night mode.\n\nDay Free Games are played when you have three or more wild symbols on the reels, which can only land in daylight mode: with 3, 4, or 5, you can win 2, 20, or 200x your total bet. It may seem complicated to understand the transition between the two features from the first game, but it will all become very understandable and intuitive as you play.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Jane Jones: Book of Kings 2\nGraphically, the slot is impeccable and well-crafted. Unfortunately, we do not like the absence of an accompanying sound that can surround and involve the player in the game action. But this is a subjective detail that for many may not pose any problems. Its two modes, two expanding scatters, and the unlimited free spins they offer are interesting.

We're talking about Jane Jones: Book of Kings 2, which is a sure bet for gamers who love travel and beautiful graphics. In this journey to the Himalayas, you'll find yourself facing a structure with 5 reels and 10 pay lines, along with a range of bonuses and features that are worth trying. With 2 scatters, when you're in night mode, you can try the Night Free Games function that's characterized by a special expanding symbol. While playing in daylight mode, you'll have a different icon that also uses the expanding mechanic. Both lead to unlimited free spins, which are undoubtedly the best choice when it comes to slot machines. But let's find out more about this slot game that has an RTP set at 96.5%, and can offer up to 4,000x your bet for each spin.\n\nSlot Graphics\nIn this sequel, our charming adventurer Jane Jones is ready for anything and about to move to ancient Egypt. Behind the game grid, you'll find the Himalayas, with snow-capped mountains and Buddhist temples that have excellent graphics. The theme is deepened thanks to symbols that range from classic royal cards such as A, K, Q, J, and 10 with a low value. Then there are Buddhist deities in gold, a pendant, a Buddha, and of course, the unmissable and sexy Jane Jones. She is the most profitable symbol and pays 1, 8, 40, or 400 times your bet if it appears 2, 3, 4, or 5 times in one spin. As mentioned, there are also symbols for Day and Night mode that are Scatters, which we'll talk about in the next section related to its bonus features.\n\nSpecial Features\nLet's start with Night Mode, which opens with the landing of only 2 scatters, just like Day Free Games. The player has the opportunity to have unlimited free spins, with the central function of the expanding symbol that can cover the entire grid. The base game of Book of Kings 2 starts with Day, and you can randomly unlock Night mode.\n\nDay Free Games are played when you have three or more wild symbols on the reels, which can only land in daylight mode: with 3, 4, or 5, you can win 2, 20, or 200x your total bet. It may seem complicated to understand the transition between the two features from the first game, but it will all become very understandable and intuitive as you play.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Jane Jones: Book of Kings 2\nGraphically, the slot is impeccable and well-crafted. Unfortunately, we do not like the absence of an accompanying sound that can surround and involve the player in the game action. But this is a subjective detail that for many may not pose any problems. Its two modes, two expanding scatters, and the unlimited free spins they offer are interesting. Keep an eye on the beautiful Jane Jones to trigger a win equal to 4,000 times your final bet. This slot game is a top choice for experienced gamblers looking for something new and exciting.\n            ",

We're talking about Jane Jones: Book of Kings 2, which is a sure bet for gamers who love travel and beautiful graphics. In this journey to the Himalayas, you'll find yourself facing a structure with 5 reels and 10 pay lines, along with a range of bonuses and features that are worth trying. With 2 scatters, when you're in night mode, you can try the Night Free Games function that's characterized by a special expanding symbol. While playing in daylight mode, you'll have a different icon that also uses the expanding mechanic. Both lead to unlimited free spins, which are undoubtedly the best choice when it comes to slot machines. But let's find out more about this slot game that has an RTP set at 96.5%, and can offer up to 4,000x your bet for each spin.\n\nSlot Graphics\nIn this sequel, our charming adventurer Jane Jones is ready for anything and about to move to ancient Egypt. Behind the game grid, you'll find the Himalayas, with snow-capped mountains and Buddhist temples that have excellent graphics. The theme is deepened thanks to symbols that range from classic royal cards such as A, K, Q, J, and 10 with a low value. Then there are Buddhist deities in gold, a pendant, a Buddha, and of course, the unmissable and sexy Jane Jones. She is the most profitable symbol and pays 1, 8, 40, or 400 times your bet if it appears 2, 3, 4, or 5 times in one spin. As mentioned, there are also symbols for Day and Night mode that are Scatters, which we'll talk about in the next section related to its bonus features.\n\nSpecial Features\nLet's start with Night Mode, which opens with the landing of only 2 scatters, just like Day Free Games. The player has the opportunity to have unlimited free spins, with the central function of the expanding symbol that can cover the entire grid. The base game of Book of Kings 2 starts with Day, and you can randomly unlock Night mode.\n\nDay Free Games are played when you have three or more wild symbols on the reels, which can only land in daylight mode: with 3, 4, or 5, you can win 2, 20, or 200x your total bet. It may seem complicated to understand the transition between the two features from the first game, but it will all become very understandable and intuitive as you play.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Jane Jones: Book of Kings 2\nGraphically, the slot is impeccable and well-crafted. Unfortunately, we do not like the absence of an accompanying sound that can surround and involve the player in the game action. But this is a subjective detail that for many may not pose any problems. Its two modes, two expanding scatters, and the unlimited free spins they offer are interesting. Keep an eye on the beautiful Jane Jones to trigger a win equal to 4,000 times your final bet. This slot game is a top choice for experienced gamblers looking for something new and exciting.\n            ",

We're talking about Jane Jones: Book of Kings 2, which is a sure bet for gamers who love travel and beautiful graphics. In this journey to the Himalayas, you'll find yourself facing a structure with 5 reels and 10 pay lines, along with a range of bonuses and features that are worth trying. With 2 scatters, when you're in night mode, you can try the Night Free Games function that's characterized by a special expanding symbol. While playing in daylight mode, you'll have a different icon that also uses the expanding mechanic. Both lead to unlimited free spins, which are undoubtedly the best choice when it comes to slot machines. But let's find out more about this slot game that has an RTP set at 96.5%, and can offer up to 4,000x your bet for each spin.\n\nSlot Graphics\nIn this sequel, our charming adventurer Jane Jones is ready for anything and about to move to ancient Egypt. Behind the game grid, you'll find the Himalayas, with snow-capped mountains and Buddhist temples that have excellent graphics. The theme is deepened thanks to symbols that range from classic royal cards such as A, K, Q, J, and 10 with a low value. Then there are Buddhist deities in gold, a pendant, a Buddha, and of course, the unmissable and sexy Jane Jones. She is the most profitable symbol and pays 1, 8, 40, or 400 times your bet if it appears 2, 3, 4, or 5 times in one spin. As mentioned, there are also symbols for Day and Night mode that are Scatters, which we'll talk about in the next section related to its bonus features.\n\nSpecial Features\nLet's start with Night Mode, which opens with the landing of only 2 scatters, just like Day Free Games. The player has the opportunity to have unlimited free spins, with the central function of the expanding symbol that can cover the entire grid. The base game of Book of Kings 2 starts with Day, and you can randomly unlock Night mode.\n\nDay Free Games are played when you have three or more wild symbols on the reels, which can only land in daylight mode: with 3, 4, or 5, you can win 2, 20, or 200x your total bet. It may seem complicated to understand the transition between the two features from the first game, but it will all become very understandable and intuitive as you play.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Jane Jones: Book of Kings 2\nGraphically, the slot is impeccable and well-crafted. Unfortunately, we do not like the absence of an accompanying sound that can surround and involve the player in the game action. But this is a subjective detail that for many may not pose any problems. Its two modes, two expanding scatters, and the unlimited free spins they offer are interesting. Keep an eye on the beautiful Jane Jones to trigger a win equal to 4,000 times your final bet. This slot game is a top choice for experienced gamblers looking for something new and exciting.\n        ",
