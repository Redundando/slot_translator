In questo caso siamo in un’avventura animata, per scoprire i poteri di alcune grandi leggende che hanno le sembianze di affascinanti creature. Tra i poteri, i Wild e i giri gratuiti si ha la possibilità di mettere insieme un bel gruzzoletto, lasciandosi cullare dal suo gameplay veloce.

I rulli sono posizionati al centro di un ambiente cittadino, ed è arricchito dalla presenza di 4 creature e una serie di simboli base che offrono un pagamento più basso. Epic Legends ha previsto una funzionalità fantastica per ognuna delle 4 leggende disponibili, in base a quella che sarà sbloccata durante i giri.\nOvviamente gioca un ruolo importante il simbolo Wild che può sostituirsi a tutte le altre icone di gioco, permettendo al player di collezionare delle combinazioni vincenti. Può apparire sia nel gioco base che durante i free spin. Ma scopriamo insieme che tipo di funzionalità sono offerte dalla slot!\nFunzionalità speciali\nAbbiamo la cosiddetta Scatter Ball che può presentarsi in modo del tutto casuale al di sopra del primo rullo. Posizionandosi lì permette di attivare un nuovo giro bonus per il giocatore. A quel punto si può spostare poi verso destra e innescare nuovi giri fino a quando non si realizza una vincita. E inoltre mette in palio dei giri gratuiti. Nel momento in cui si attiva questa funzione sono assegnati 7 Free Spins che vanno ad attivare la leggenda corrispondente a quella che è raffigurata. A quel punto la gigantografia di questa creatura si posiziona alla sinistra della griglia e inizia una deliziosa animazione che rende più vivo il gameplay. In base al personaggio si possono vincere, per esempio, dei moltiplicatori tra 2x e 6x, oppure un simbolo Wild che va a coprire un intero rullo. Con la leggenda color Blu ci sono dei Wild che si trasformano in Sticky Wild fino al termine dei giri e della funzione. Ma occhio alla creatura Rossa, perché ha il potere di sostituisce tutti i simboli sul secondo e terzo rullo con un simbolo del gioco base.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Epic Legends\nIl tema è curioso, dobbiamo riconoscerlo, e nel complesso la slot offre un discreto livello di divertimento, una bella grafica e qualche vincita che può fare la differenza. Le leggende sono la chiave del successo di Epic Legends e ti possono portare a ricercare una ricchezza sempre maggiore.\n",

Developed by the brilliant minds at Evoplay who are renowned for their impeccable gambling solutions, this animated adventure is a must-play for experienced gamblers. With the powers of fascinating creatures embodied in legendary characters, players have the chance to hit it big with Wilds and free spins, all while enjoying the game's fast-paced gameplay. Boasting a 96.16% RTP, medium volatility, and a standard structure with 20 paylines, Epic Legends is a slot worth exploring.\n\nThe slot's graphics and features are not tied to any specific historical era. Instead, it gives the impression of being set in the future, with reels that sit amidst a vivid cityscape featuring four creatures and a variety of basic symbols that offer lower payouts. Epic Legends offers fantastic functionality for each of the four available legends, depending on which is unlocked during the spins. The all-important Wild symbol plays a vital role in substituting other game icons to allow players to form winning combinations. It can appear in both the base game and during free spins. Let's take a closer look at the slot's functionalities.\n\nThe Scatter Ball, which can appear entirely at random above the first reel, is the defining special feature. Once it appears, it activates a new bonus spin for the player and can be moved rightwards to trigger new spins until a win is activated, alongside the possibility of winning free spins. When this feature is activated, seven free spins are assigned, which activate the corresponding legend's animation on the left side of the screen. Depending on the legend, players can win multipliers of up to 2x to 6x or one Wild symbol that covers an entire reel. Blue legends feature Wilds that transform into Sticky Wilds until the end of the feature. However, players should be wary of the Red creature as it replaces all symbols on the second and third reels with a base game symbol.\n\nOverall, Epic Legends is intriguing in its theme, provides a fair level of entertainment, boasts beautiful graphics and occasional big payouts. The legends are a key success factor in Epic Legends and can pave the way to an ever-increasing wealth, making it a must-play.",

Developed by the genius minds at Evoplay, this game is sure to impress with its impeccable gambling solutions and special effects. You'll embark on an animated journey to discover the powers of legendary creatures that grace the reels. With Wilds and free spins, you'll have the chance to hit a big win while being swept away by the game's lightning-fast gameplay. The game boasts an RTP of 96.16%, a medium volatility, and a standard structure with 20 paylines. Let's dive into the features and excitement that this slot has to offer.\n\nCharacteristics and Graphics of the Slot\nWhile we're not quite sure what era we're in, it's clear that Epic Legends is set in the future. The reels are positioned in the middle of a city-like environment and decorated with four mystical creatures, as well as a series of basic symbols that offer lower payouts. The game features a unique function for each of the four available legends, all of which are unlocked during gameplay. Of course, the Wild symbol plays a significant role and can substitute for all other symbols, making it easier to hit winning combinations. The Wild can appear in both the base game and during free spins. But let's take a closer look at the special features that this slot offers.\n\nSpecial Features\nOne of the highlights of the game is the Scatter Ball, which can appear randomly above the first reel. When it lands there, it activates a new bonus spin for the player, allowing for even more chances to win. The Scatter Ball can then move to the right to trigger additional spins until a win is achieved. Additionally, the Scatter Ball offers free spins. When activated, players are awarded seven free spins that correspond to the legend displayed on the screen. The giant creature will then appear on the left side of the grid and initiate a delightful animation that enhances the gameplay. Depending on the character, you can win a multiplier of between 2x and 6x, or a Wild symbol that covers an entire reel. With the Blue legend, Wilds transform into Sticky Wilds until the end of the feature. But beware of the Red creature, as it has the power to replace all symbols on the second and third reels with a base game symbol.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Epic Legends\nThe game's intriguing theme and overall design make for a decent level of entertainment, coupled with the chance to hit a big win. The key to success in Epic Legends lies in discovering the power of the legendary creatures, which can lead you to seek ever-greater riches. As an experienced gambler, you won't want to miss out on this thrilling adventure.\n        ",
