The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of the most read books in the world, which over time has become a movie titled \"The Wizard of Oz\" in 1939. So, it was only a matter of time before it transformed once again and lent its name to an online slot, as in the case of Microgaming's Book of Oz Lock 'n Spin.\nIn fact, we are facing a sequel to the previously released Book of Oz slot and the title itself hints at the rich novelty of this slot machine.\nLet's discover together all its features in this brief review.\nBook of Oz Lock 'n Spin – Visual Impact\nAlthough gameplay mechanics play a vital role in reviewing a slot, we cannot forget the role played by the graphics. This is the first aspect we notice as soon as we open the slot, so it is important to talk about it.\nIn the case of Book of Oz Lock 'n Spin, the slot uses the color green, which permeates the background and the symbols themselves, giving almost an Irish air to the entire title, which certainly refers to the Emerald City.\nInside the game grid, we find various symbols that recall the world of magic, although there is no frantic care in looking for new figures to propose: this is one of the few cases where in the stage of combinations we find both the symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q, J and 10) and the same suit of them, represented in the form of a magic filter (flowers, hearts, spades, and diamonds).\nA simple slot that presents itself but has a lot to offer from a gameplay point of view.\nBook of Oz Lock 'n Spin – Spin Twice\nFrom a technical point of view, the slot that presents itself to us seems to satisfy many of the typical canons of online slots. In this case, we are talking about five reels that show three symbols each (detecting fifteen symbols at each play, consequently) and a rather limited number of paylines, which is ten.\nThe function that interests us the most, and which, in fact, gives its name to this slot, is that of Lock 'n Spin. This function, once more common, has fallen into disuse in the world of online slots, and it is possible to find only a handful of titles that offer it. What is it about? Simply put, after spinning the reels for the first time, we can lock as many as we want and spin the others again, searching for a winning combination.\nOf course, performing this action generally has a cost that can increase or decrease depending on the value of the combination we are trying to hit.\nA function that allows us to significantly customize the game based on our strategy.\nSlots Similar to Book of Oz Lock 'n Spin\nGiven the love that enthusiasts have for this theme, it is not uncommon to find other titles that propose the same subject, such as Novomatic's Book of Ra or Ash Gaming's The Winning of Oz or even The Wizard of Oz Emerald City.\n            ",

The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of the most read books in the world, which over time has become a movie titled \"The Wizard of Oz\" in 1939. So, it was only a matter of time before it transformed once again and lent its name to an online slot, as in the case of Microgaming's Book of Oz Lock 'n Spin.\nIn fact, we are facing a sequel to the previously released Book of Oz slot and the title itself hints at the rich novelty of this slot machine.\nLet's discover together all its features in this brief review.\nBook of Oz Lock 'n Spin – Visual Impact\nAlthough gameplay mechanics play a vital role in reviewing a slot, we cannot forget the role played by the graphics. This is the first aspect we notice as soon as we open the slot, so it is important to talk about it.\nIn the case of Book of Oz Lock 'n Spin, the slot uses the color green, which permeates the background and the symbols themselves, giving almost an Irish air to the entire title, which certainly refers to the Emerald City.\nInside the game grid, we find various symbols that recall the world of magic, although there is no frantic care in looking for new figures to propose: this is one of the few cases where in the stage of combinations we find both the symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q, J and 10) and the same suit of them, represented in the form of a magic filter (flowers, hearts, spades, and diamonds).\nA simple slot that presents itself but has a lot to offer from a gameplay point of view.\nBook of Oz Lock 'n Spin – Spin Twice\nFrom a technical point of view, the slot that presents itself to us seems to satisfy many of the typical canons of online slots. In this case, we are talking about five reels that show three symbols each (detecting fifteen symbols at each play, consequently) and a rather limited number of paylines, which is ten.\nThe function that interests us the most, and which, in fact, gives its name to this slot, is that of Lock 'n Spin. This function, once more common, has fallen into disuse in the world of online slots, and it is possible to find only a handful of titles that offer it. What is it about? Simply put, after spinning the reels for the first time, we can lock as many as we want and spin the others again, searching for a winning combination.\nOf course, performing this action generally has a cost that can increase or decrease depending on the value of the combination we are trying to hit.\nA function that allows us to significantly customize the game based on our strategy.\nSlots Similar to Book of Oz Lock 'n Spin\nGiven the love that enthusiasts have for this theme, it is not uncommon to find other titles that propose the same subject, such as Novomatic's Book of Ra or Ash Gaming's The Winning of Oz or even The Wizard of Oz Emerald City.\n            ",

The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of the most read books in the world, which over time has become a movie titled \"The Wizard of Oz\" in 1939. So, it was only a matter of time before it transformed once again and lent its name to an online slot, as in the case of Microgaming's Book of Oz Lock 'n Spin.\nIn fact, we are facing a sequel to the previously released Book of Oz slot and the title itself hints at the rich novelty of this slot machine.\nLet's discover together all its features in this brief review.\nBook of Oz Lock 'n Spin – Visual Impact\nAlthough gameplay mechanics play a vital role in reviewing a slot, we cannot forget the role played by the graphics. This is the first aspect we notice as soon as we open the slot, so it is important to talk about it.\nIn the case of Book of Oz Lock 'n Spin, the slot uses the color green, which permeates the background and the symbols themselves, giving almost an Irish air to the entire title, which certainly refers to the Emerald City.\nInside the game grid, we find various symbols that recall the world of magic, although there is no frantic care in looking for new figures to propose: this is one of the few cases where in the stage of combinations we find both the symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q, J and 10) and the same suit of them, represented in the form of a magic filter (flowers, hearts, spades, and diamonds).\nA simple slot that presents itself but has a lot to offer from a gameplay point of view.\nBook of Oz Lock 'n Spin – Spin Twice\nFrom a technical point of view, the slot that presents itself to us seems to satisfy many of the typical canons of online slots. In this case, we are talking about five reels that show three symbols each (detecting fifteen symbols at each play, consequently) and a rather limited number of paylines, which is ten.\nThe function that interests us the most, and which, in fact, gives its name to this slot, is that of Lock 'n Spin. This function, once more common, has fallen into disuse in the world of online slots, and it is possible to find only a handful of titles that offer it. What is it about? Simply put, after spinning the reels for the first time, we can lock as many as we want and spin the others again, searching for a winning combination.\nOf course, performing this action generally has a cost that can increase or decrease depending on the value of the combination we are trying to hit.\nA function that allows us to significantly customize the game based on our strategy.\nSlots Similar to Book of Oz Lock 'n Spin\nGiven the love that enthusiasts have for this theme, it is not uncommon to find other titles that propose the same subject, such as Novomatic's Book of Ra or Ash Gaming's The Winning of Oz or even The Wizard of Oz Emerald City.\n            ",
