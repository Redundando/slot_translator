Ebbene, anziché le classiche linee di pagamento, su questa slot ad essere premiati sono i cluster, ovvero i blocchi di più simboli uguali. Ogni volta che vengono visualizzati 5 o  più simboli adiacenti, in qualsiasi direzione, otterrete un pagamento per i simboli inclusi. I cluster possono avere qualsiasi forma, perciò non importa se siano orizzontali, verticali, a croce, a “quadrato” o di altro tipo: ogni volta che almeno 5 simboli uguali saranno vicini tra loro, otterrete il pagamento per quel simbolo. Ovviamente, più simboli ci saranno meglio è!\nMa non è tutto. Ogni volta che si ottiene un cluster vincente, questo esplode e fa posto ad altri simboli, senza che il giocatore debba fare alcuna puntata.

Okay, ma Betsoft qui cala l’asso. Ogni volta che ottenete una combinazione vincente di un simbolo, questo va a riempire il “Lava Meter”, un misuratore sulla destra del display. Si parte dal simbolo J, quindi Q, K, A ecc. Una volta che lo si riempie tutto si attivano 10 free spin.\nMa sono 10 free spin speciali! Infatti, per ogni free spin vi è il rullo centrale completamente formato da un unico simbolo (normale o wild) e perciò si ottiene di sicuro una combinazione vincente (poiché sono 5 simboli) che può essere arricchita dai simboli adiacenti.\nMa ciò che è davvero fantastico è che c’è un moltiplicatore crescente: x1 al primo giro, x2 al secondo giro, x3 al terzo giro e così via fino al x10 dell’ultimo giro!\nSe considerate che ci sono simboli wild (il vulcano), la fase bonus free spin può diventare davvero una fase d’oro!\nDettagli di Lava Gold\nLava Gold presenta un display 5×5 e un sistema di pagamento con cluster.

Whenever 5 or more adjacent symbols are displayed, in any direction, you get a payment for the symbols included.

Alright, but Betsoft pulls out all the stops here. Every time you get a winning combination of a symbol, it fills up the \"Lava Meter\", a gauge on the right side of the display. It starts with the J symbol, then Q, K, A, etc. Once the gauge is full, 10 free spins are activated.\n\nBut these are 10 special free spins! In fact, for each free spin, the middle reel is completely filled with a single symbol (normal or wild) and therefore you are guaranteed a winning combination (since there are 5 symbols) that can be enriched by adjacent symbols.\n\nBut what's really fantastic is that there is a growing multiplier: x1 on the first spin, x2 on the second spin, x3 on the third spin, and so on up to x10 on the final spin!\n\nConsidering that there are also wild symbols (the volcano), the free spin bonus phase can truly become a golden phase!\n\nDetails of Lava Gold\nLava Gold features a 5x5 display and a payment system with clusters. The minimum bet is €0.25 per spin. The volatility of the game is medium and the RTP is 95.99%.

During the free spins, the middle reel gets filled with a single symbol, either wild or normal, making the game's volatility medium. The multiplier values grow from x1 to x10, promising players an excellent playing experience and possibilities to earn lots of payouts.\n\nCompatibility with different operating systems\n\nLava Gold has been designed and developed by Betsoft, making it compatible with iOS, Android, and Windows operating systems.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics and Features\n\nLava Gold features a 5x5 display with a payment system based on clusters of matching symbols instead of traditional paylines. Each adjacent cluster of 5 or more matching symbols results in a payment. The game also includes a cascading symbols mechanism where any winning cluster explodes and makes room for other symbols, thereby creating additional winning combinations that do not require any extra bets. The game's wild symbol is a volcano that can substitute any symbol to form a winning cluster.\n\nCluster Feature and Symbol Matching\n\nIn Lava Gold, players earn payments based on cluster matches made up of 5 or more adjacent symbols, which can be arranged in any direction or shape. Clusters can be horizontal, vertical, cross-shaped, or square-shaped as long as they have at least 5 adjacent matching symbols. The game has a high win potential as a result of its cascading symbols mechanism, which creates additional winning combinations.\n\nLava Meter and Free Spins\n\nOnce a winning cluster is created in Lava Gold, the Lava Meter gauge on the right side of the display is filled. Once full, the player is awarded 10 free spins that come with a progressive multiplier, starting at x1 and increasing up to x10. During each free spin, the middle reel is completely filled with a single symbol (normal or wild), guaranteeing a winning combination. This phase offers an excellent chance for players to earn additional payouts.\n\nCompatibility and Accessibility\n\nLava Gold is a slot game compatible with Windows, iOS, and Android operating systems, allowing players to access it on desktop and mobile devices. The game does not require players to download any additional software and can be accessed directly from their web browser.\n\nVolatility and Betting Options\n\nLava Gold is a medium-volatility slot game with a minimum bet of €0.25 per spin. The RTP of the game is 95.99%, which is above the average RTP found in most online slots. The game allows players to adjust their betting preferences based on their preferred wagering habits.\n\n        \n            ",

But in this game, instead of running away, you must collect as much gold as possible! This is an exciting story, full of surprises and free spins!\n\nThe Cluster Feature in Lava Gold\nWith Lava Gold, you'll never get bored. First of all, there is a beautiful 5x5 display that shows 25 symbols on each spin. But instead of the classic paylines, this slot awards clusters, which are blocks of matching symbols. Whenever 5 or more adjacent symbols are displayed, in any direction, you get a payment for the symbols included. The clusters can be of any shape, so it doesn't matter if they are horizontal, vertical, cross-shaped, square-shaped or any other type: every time at least 5 matching symbols are close to each other, you will get paid for that symbol. Of course, the more symbols there are, the better!\n\nBut that's not all. Every time you get a winning cluster, it explodes and makes room for other symbols, without the player having to place any bets. These can create additional winning combinations, thus creating partial free spins that can continue as long as there are winning clusters. It's possible to see the entire display of symbols explode!\n\nWhat Makes Lava Gold Truly Special\nOkay, you may say, we've already seen the cascading symbols mechanism. Alright, but Betsoft pulls out all the stops here. Every time you get a winning combination of a symbol, it fills up the \"Lava Meter\", a gauge on the right side of the display. It starts with the J symbol, then Q, K, A, etc. Once the gauge is full, 10 free spins are activated.\n\nBut these are 10 special free spins! In fact, for each free spin, the middle reel is completely filled with a single symbol (normal or wild) and therefore you are guaranteed a winning combination (since there are 5 symbols) that can be enriched by adjacent symbols.\n\nBut what's really fantastic is that there is a growing multiplier: x1 on the first spin, x2 on the second spin, x3 on the third spin, and so on up to x10 on the final spin!\n\nConsidering that there are also wild symbols (the volcano), the free spin bonus phase can truly become a golden phase!\n\nDetails of Lava Gold\nLava Gold features a 5x5 display and a payment system with clusters. The minimum bet is €0.25 per spin. The volatility of the game is medium and the RTP is 95.99%. It's compatible with Windows, iOS and Android operating systems and can be played on desktop and mobile devices.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat are the features of the Lava Gold slot?\n\nLava Gold features two special characteristics: cluster paylines and free spins with a progressive multiplier.

But in this game, instead of running away, you must collect as much gold as possible! This is an exciting story, full of surprises and free spins!\n\nThe Cluster Feature in Lava Gold\nWith Lava Gold, you'll never get bored. First of all, there is a beautiful 5x5 display that shows 25 symbols on each spin. But instead of the classic paylines, this slot awards clusters, which are blocks of matching symbols. Whenever 5 or more adjacent symbols are displayed, in any direction, you get a payment for the symbols included. The clusters can be of any shape, so it doesn't matter if they are horizontal, vertical, cross-shaped, square-shaped or any other type: every time at least 5 matching symbols are close to each other, you will get paid for that symbol. Of course, the more symbols there are, the better!\n\nBut that's not all. Every time you get a winning cluster, it explodes and makes room for other symbols, without the player having to place any bets. These can create additional winning combinations, thus creating partial free spins that can continue as long as there are winning clusters. It's possible to see the entire display of symbols explode!\n\nWhat Makes Lava Gold Truly Special\nOkay, you may say, we've already seen the cascading symbols mechanism. Alright, but Betsoft pulls out all the stops here. Every time you get a winning combination of a symbol, it fills up the \"Lava Meter\", a gauge on the right side of the display. It starts with the J symbol, then Q, K, A, etc. Once the gauge is full, 10 free spins are activated.\n\nBut these are 10 special free spins! In fact, for each free spin, the middle reel is completely filled with a single symbol (normal or wild) and therefore you are guaranteed a winning combination (since there are 5 symbols) that can be enriched by adjacent symbols.\n\nBut what's really fantastic is that there is a growing multiplier: x1 on the first spin, x2 on the second spin, x3 on the third spin, and so on up to x10 on the final spin!\n\nConsidering that there are also wild symbols (the volcano), the free spin bonus phase can truly become a golden phase!\n\nDetails of Lava Gold\nLava Gold features a 5x5 display and a payment system with clusters. The minimum bet is €0.25 per spin. The volatility of the game is medium and the RTP is 95.99%. It's compatible with Windows, iOS and Android operating systems and can be played on desktop and mobile devices.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat are the features of the Lava Gold slot?\n\nLava Gold features two special characteristics: cluster paylines and free spins with a progressive multiplier.
