La schermata iniziale riporta il nome della slot inserito nel contesto della foresta, mentre la schermata di gioco è molto semplice, con i rulli incorniciati in una sorta di tempio.

The initial screen displays the slot's name in the context of the forest, while the game screen is very simple, with the reels framed in a type of temple.\n\nThe main features of the slot include five reels, three rows, and 20 fixed paylines which are all activated automatically. Bets for each spin range from €0.20 to €60.\n\nThe return to player (RTP) is 95.94%, with a high volatility (4.5/5), making wins less frequent but potentially quite profitable.\n\nPlayers can try this slot in Play for Fun mode for free to practice and discover its secrets before betting real money.\n\nThe symbols that appear on the reels of Amazon Queen, excluding the four playing card suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades), are all thematic, including a gorilla, a snake, a parrot, a tiger, and tropical fruits. The game's Wild symbol is represented by a waterfall, which acts as a wild card and replaces all other symbols except for the Scatter to complete winning combinations.\n\nThe Scatter symbol is the queen of the forest herself: if she appears three times, she awards 10 free spins, while four Scatters give 25 free spins, and five give the player an impressive 100 free spins! The jackpot can be won with the gorilla, which is the most valuable regular symbol.\n\nOverall, Amazon Queen is an easy and intuitive game, more suited to beginners than experienced players, and it may be disappointing for high rollers. It is a good game, potentially quite profitable, but without special effects, neither graphic nor in terms of gameplay.",

The game's wild symbol is a waterfall that can replace all other symbols aside from scatter to complete a winning combination. The scatter symbol is the queen of the forest, and when it appears, it awards free spins to players.\n\nBetting range and maximum winnings\n\nPlayers can bet between 20 cents and €60 per spin, making it an ideal game for those who prefer modest betting ranges. Amazon Queen's RTP is 95.94%, which is an acceptable rate, and the game's high volatility (4.5/5) suggests that wins may not occur frequently, but they can be quite profitable. The gorilla symbol, which has the highest value, is the key to hit the jackpot and earn the maximum winnings in the game.\n\nVolatility rating and return to player percentage\n\nAmazon Queen is a high-volatility slot with a return to player percentage of 95.94%, which is slightly lower than the industry average. This means that players may have to spin the reels for a while before landing a winning combination, but the rewards can be substantial when they come.\n\nJackpot and highest value symbol\n\nThe gorilla symbol, which is one of the game's regular symbols, has the highest value and is the key to hitting the jackpot. Players who can land five gorilla symbols on the reels will earn the highest payout in the game, making it an essential symbol to watch out for if you want to maximize your earnings in Amazon Queen.\n\nOverall gaming experience\n\nOverall, Amazon Queen is a reasonably good slot game, with graphics that are aligned with the jungle theme and straightforward gameplay. However, it is not a slot game that offers anything particularly unique or exciting in terms of its features or gameplay. The game is best suited for novice players who prefer modest betting ranges, as well as for those looking for a higher volatility game with the potential for significant rewards. \n\n        \n            ",

At the bottom of the screen, we find the control buttons, and on the left side, the \"info\" button gives access to the paytable so players can learn the value of each symbol in various combinations.\n\nKey features of the slot\n\nAmazon Queen is a title that is certainly familiar to fans of land-based slot machines. In the past, this game was very popular in bars due to its excellent winning potential. \n\nThe online version of Amazon Queen maintains the same gameplay structure as its land-based counterpart, with the addition of some enhancements that make the gaming experience even more exciting. Amazon Queen features five reels, three rows, and 20 paylines, which are fixed and, therefore, automatically activated all together. The bets for each spin range from 20 cents up to a maximum of €60.\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.94%, which is acceptable, and the volatility of Amazon Queen is quite high (4.5/5), making wins not very frequent but potentially quite profitable.\n\nIt is possible to play this slot in Play for Fun mode, totally free, to practice and discover its tricks before betting real money.\n\nSymbols and features of Amazon Queen\n\nExcluding the four suits of playing cards (hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds), the symbols alternating on the reels of Amazon Queen are entirely thematic. We find a gorilla, a snake, a parrot, a tiger, and tropical fruits. The game's wild symbol is represented by a waterfall, which serves as a joker and replaces all other symbols except the scatter to complete a winning combination.\n\nThe scatter is the queen of the forest herself: if it appears three times, it awards 10 free spins, while if it appears four times, it awards 25 free spins. When it appears on all five reels, it allows you to play as many as 100 free spins!\n\nThe jackpot can be obtained thanks to the gorilla, which among the regular symbols has the highest value.\n\nVerdict\n\nIt is a slot with very easy and intuitive gameplay, in our opinion, more suitable for beginners than experienced gamblers and may disappoint high rollers. Overall, it is a good game, potentially quite profitable but without special effects, neither graphics nor regarding the gameplay.\n            ",
