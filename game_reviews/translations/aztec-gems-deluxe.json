Un tema utilizzatissimo perché ricercatissimo, del resto chi non vorrebbe sentirsi come Indiana Jones, esplorando luoghi millenari e avvolti dall’ignoto? Pragmatic Play prova a far sentire così i giocatori di slot machines, catapultandoli in una giungla selvaggia alla ricerca di antiche gemme azteche con Aztec Gems Deluxe.\nA caccia di antiche gemme con Aztec Gems Deluxe\nSemplice ma estremamente carismatico, perché a volte basta davvero poco per creare qualcosa di soddisfacente. Con questa premessa, la Pragmatic Play ci catapulta nella giungla di Aztec Gems Deluxe, caratterizzata da una semplice griglia da 3 rulli e 3 linee, che offre giocate tranquille e quasi rilassanti, specialmente se non si vuole seguire qualcosa di troppo caotico. La griglia, caratterizzata principalmente dall’oro che ne ospita i simboli e che la contorna, è posta su uno sfondo davvero affascinante: delle verdi cascate nel cuore della giungla. Insieme alla musica, il comparto grafico creato dalla Pragmatic Play riesce a farci immergere perfettamente in quest’atmosfera tranquilla e misteriosa, tra le fitte foglie della giungla. Come si può evincere dal titolo, i simboli protagonisti di questa slot machine sono delle preziose gemme: un topazio triangolare, uno zaffiro pentagonale, uno smeraldo esagonale, un ametista ottagonale ed infine un rubino a forma di triangolo rovesciato, il simbolo più prezioso. Come simbolo Wild troviamo una bellissima decorazione azteca raffigurante una sorta di divinità, e in cui sono incastonate molte delle gemme già citate, mentre il simbolo Scatter è assente, sostituito dal simbolo Denaro. Questo nuovo simbolo, che possiede comunque una funzione in parte molto simile allo scatter, è caratterizzato da delle incisioni azteche su una lastra blu.\nAztec Gems Deluxe e i simboli Denaro\nIl gameplay di Aztec Gems Deluxe è molto semplice, proprio come il suo stile grafico. Ma nuovamente, è importante ribadire che in questo caso la semplicità non è un difetto e anzi, potrebbe essere proprio il punto di forza di questa slot machine. Il nuovo simbolo Denaro a cui abbiamo accennato alla fine dello scorso paragrafo sostituisce lo scatter, ma porta con sé una nuova funzione: ogni volta che verrà ottenuto (può apparire su tutti i rulli) assumerò un valore in denaro casuale da un set predefinito che verrà aggiunto alla vincita del giocatore. Ottenendo 4 o più simboli denaro si attiverà la modalità Money Respin, che donerà 3 spin gratuite al giocatore in cui potranno apparire solo simboli denaro e che, alla fine di questa modalità (le cui spin gratuite possono aumentare trovando in continuazione simboli Denaro) riceverà l’ammontare totale di tutti i simboli ottenuti. A questo punto il gioco offre due alternative scelte casualmente, o un moltiplicatore applicato alla vincita o una ruota della fortuna che tra i premi offre ingenti moltiplicatori o vari jackpot. Il RTP è del 96.5%\nSlot simili ad Aztec Gems Deluxe\nSe volete immergervi di nuovo nella giungla dopo aver giocato Aztec Gems Deluxe potrebbero interessarvi slot come Aztec Bonanza o Jungle Gorilla (entrambe della Pragmatic Play).\n",

The grid, primarily characterized by gold that houses the symbols and surrounds it, is placed against a truly fascinating backdrop - a green waterfall in the heart of the jungle. The symbols of this slot machine are precious gems, including a triangular topaz, a pentagonal sapphire, a hexagonal emerald, an octagonal amethyst, and lastly, an inverted triangular ruby, the most precious symbol. The Wild symbol is a beautiful Aztec decoration depicting a kind of deity and inlaid with many of the aforementioned gems, while the Scatter symbol is absent, replaced by the Denaro symbol. This new symbol, which still possesses a function partly similar to the Scatter, is characterized by Aztec engravings on a blue plaque.\n\nMoney Respin Mode\n\nThe new Denaro symbol we mentioned earlier replaces the Scatter symbol but comes with a new function: every time it's obtained (it can appear on all reels), it assumes a random cash value from a predetermined set added to the player's winnings. Obtaining 4 or more Denaro symbols triggers the Money Respin mode, which gives the player 3 free spins where only Denaro symbols can appear, and at the end of this mode (whose free spins can increase by continuously finding Denaro symbols), the player receives the total amount of all the symbols obtained. At this point, the game offers two randomly chosen alternatives: either a multiplier applied to the winnings or a wheel of fortune that offers substantial multipliers or various jackpots.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics of Aztec Gems Deluxe succeed in immersing players perfectly in a peaceful and mysterious atmosphere, among the dense leaves of the jungle. The grid, primarily characterized by gold, houses the symbols and is placed against a truly fascinating backdrop - a green waterfall in the heart of the jungle. The music adds to the overall immersive experience.\n\nWinning Opportunities\n\nAztec Gems Deluxe offers players a chance to win big. The Denaro symbol offers a new way to win, with a random cash value added to the player's winnings every time it's obtained. The Money Respin mode is triggered when 4 or more of these symbols are obtained, giving the player 3 free spins where only Denaro symbols can appear. The game offers two alternatives after the Money Respin mode: either a multiplier applied to the winnings or a wheel of fortune that offers substantial multipliers or various jackpots.\n\nRTP\n\nThe RTP (Return to Player) of Aztec Gems Deluxe is 96.5%, which means that players can expect a fair return on their investment over the long term.\n\n        \n            ",

It's a popular theme because it's highly sought after. After all, who wouldn't want to feel like Indiana Jones, exploring age-old places shrouded in mystery? Pragmatic Play attempts to make slot players feel this way, transporting them to a wild jungle in search of ancient Aztec gems with Aztec Gems Deluxe.\n\nHunting for Hidden Gems with Aztec Gems Deluxe\n\nThis game may seem simple, but it's extremely charismatic. Sometimes, it only takes a little effort to create something satisfying. Pragmatic Play catapults us into the jungle of Aztec Gems Deluxe, featuring a simple grid with 3 reels and 3 lines that offer tranquil and almost relaxing gameplay, especially if you don't want to follow something too chaotic. The grid, primarily characterized by gold that houses the symbols and surrounds it, is placed against a truly fascinating backdrop - a green waterfall in the heart of the jungle. Along with the music, the graphics created by Pragmatic Play succeeds in immersing us perfectly in this peaceful and mysterious atmosphere, among the dense leaves of the jungle. As the title suggests, the featured symbols of this slot machine are precious gems, including a triangular topaz, a pentagonal sapphire, a hexagonal emerald, an octagonal amethyst, and lastly, an inverted triangular ruby, the most precious symbol. The Wild symbol is a beautiful Aztec decoration depicting a kind of deity and inlaid with many of the aforementioned gems, while the Scatter symbol is absent, replaced by the Denaro symbol. This new symbol, which still possesses a function partly similar to the Scatter, is characterized by Aztec engravings on a blue plaque.\n\nAztec Gems Deluxe and the Denaro Symbols\n\nThe gameplay of Aztec Gems Deluxe is straightforward, just like its graphic style. However, it's important to note that in this case, simplicity is not a drawback, and it could even be the strength of this slot machine. The new Denaro symbol we mentioned in the previous paragraph replaces the Scatter symbol but comes with a new function: every time it's obtained (it can appear on all reels), it assumes a random cash value from a predetermined set added to the player's winnings. Obtaining 4 or more Denaro symbols triggers the Money Respin mode, which gives the player 3 free spins where only Denaro symbols can appear, and at the end of this mode (whose free spins can increase by continuously finding Denaro symbols), the player receives the total amount of all the symbols obtained. At this point, the game offers two randomly chosen alternatives: either a multiplier applied to the winnings or a wheel of fortune that offers substantial multipliers or various jackpots. The RTP is 96.5%.\n\nSimilar Slots to Aztec Gems Deluxe\n\nIf you want to immerse yourself in the jungle again after playing Aztec Gems Deluxe, you might be interested in slots such as Aztec Bonanza or Jungle Gorilla (both from Pragmatic Play). For experienced gamblers who want to explore the mysteries of the Aztec Empire, Aztec Gems Deluxe is a truly satisfying game that offers a chance to win big.\n            ",

It's a popular theme because it's highly sought after. After all, who wouldn't want to feel like Indiana Jones, exploring age-old places shrouded in mystery? Pragmatic Play attempts to make slot players feel this way, transporting them to a wild jungle in search of ancient Aztec gems with Aztec Gems Deluxe.\n\nHunting for Hidden Gems with Aztec Gems Deluxe\n\nThis game may seem simple, but it's extremely charismatic. Sometimes, it only takes a little effort to create something satisfying. Pragmatic Play catapults us into the jungle of Aztec Gems Deluxe, featuring a simple grid with 3 reels and 3 lines that offer tranquil and almost relaxing gameplay, especially if you don't want to follow something too chaotic. The grid, primarily characterized by gold that houses the symbols and surrounds it, is placed against a truly fascinating backdrop - a green waterfall in the heart of the jungle. Along with the music, the graphics created by Pragmatic Play succeeds in immersing us perfectly in this peaceful and mysterious atmosphere, among the dense leaves of the jungle. As the title suggests, the featured symbols of this slot machine are precious gems, including a triangular topaz, a pentagonal sapphire, a hexagonal emerald, an octagonal amethyst, and lastly, an inverted triangular ruby, the most precious symbol. The Wild symbol is a beautiful Aztec decoration depicting a kind of deity and inlaid with many of the aforementioned gems, while the Scatter symbol is absent, replaced by the Denaro symbol. This new symbol, which still possesses a function partly similar to the Scatter, is characterized by Aztec engravings on a blue plaque.\n\nAztec Gems Deluxe and the Denaro Symbols\n\nThe gameplay of Aztec Gems Deluxe is straightforward, just like its graphic style. However, it's important to note that in this case, simplicity is not a drawback, and it could even be the strength of this slot machine. The new Denaro symbol we mentioned in the previous paragraph replaces the Scatter symbol but comes with a new function: every time it's obtained (it can appear on all reels), it assumes a random cash value from a predetermined set added to the player's winnings. Obtaining 4 or more Denaro symbols triggers the Money Respin mode, which gives the player 3 free spins where only Denaro symbols can appear, and at the end of this mode (whose free spins can increase by continuously finding Denaro symbols), the player receives the total amount of all the symbols obtained. At this point, the game offers two randomly chosen alternatives: either a multiplier applied to the winnings or a wheel of fortune that offers substantial multipliers or various jackpots. The RTP is 96.5%.\n\nSimilar Slots to Aztec Gems Deluxe\n\nIf you want to immerse yourself in the jungle again after playing Aztec Gems Deluxe, you might be interested in slots such as Aztec Bonanza or Jungle Gorilla (both from Pragmatic Play). For experienced gamblers who want to explore the mysteries of the Aztec Empire, Aztec Gems Deluxe is a truly satisfying game that offers a chance to win big.\n            ",
