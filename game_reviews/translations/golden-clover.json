Instead of the classic reels, players must maneuver between shamrocks and bombs to increase the value of their winnings.\n\nGameplay and features\n\nAs players select the position of the lucky symbol and for every cell associated with it, they can multiply their winnings. Losing on a bomb cell means starting a new game. The game doesn't offer extra functions or special bonuses.\n\nGame developer and system requirements\n\nGolden Clover is developed by Onlyplay and requires no download. The game is based on HTML5 technology and works on desktops, tablets, and smartphones on popular operating systems.\n\nIrish theme and symbols\n\nGolden Clover offers a playful and cartoon-style Irish theme, with a bright green meadow background dominated by a magnificent rainbow. The game features the classic symbols of shamrocks and a lucky clover, as well as simple graphics for the bombs, all accompanied by a traditional Irish tune.\n\nRTP and winning potential\n\nGolden Clover has an RTP of 96.2%. Though the game has no extraordinary surprises, interesting winnings are offered based on the players' choices on the manual grid. Players can even win up to 118x their bet by finding all four lucky clovers while avoiding the five bomb cells.\n\n        \n            ",
