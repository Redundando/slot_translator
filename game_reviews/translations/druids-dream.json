    "original_text": "\nDruid’s Dream\nDruids Dream è una slot machine prodotta dalla software house NetEnt, che si porta nel mondo della mitologia celtica, in compagnia di creature dei boschi e simboli magici.\nSecondo la tradizione celtica i druidi erano degli antichi sacerdoti, che facevano parte dell’alta società e avevano una grande influenza anche nel mondo della politica. Non si tratta di personaggi fantastici, ma di cariche realmente esistite, che sono state presenti in Gallia per secoli. In questa bella slot la figura del druido è un pochino romanzata e rappresentata più come una sorta di creatura magica che come un’alta carica dello Stato.\nLa grafica di Druids Dream è davvero molto bella e riesce a trasmettere l’idea di trovarsi in un mondo incantato.\nOvviamente il colore che spicca su tutti è il verde: lo è il bosco che fa da sfondo al gioco, lo sono i vestiti e i copricapi dei protagonisti, lo sono alcune icone.\nInsieme ai druidi compaiono sui rulli dei simboli legati alla natura, riprodotti in maniera molto accurata e realistica, per un effetto finale e un’esperienza di gioco molto affascinanti e coinvolgenti.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nDruids Dream è una slot machine con una struttura canonica, composta da cinque rulli e tre righe, mentre le linee di pagamento sono ben 40. Il range di scommesse in questo caso è davvero molto ampio, partendo da una puntata minima di soli 20 centesimi a giro fino ad arrivare all’interessante cifra di 400 €, con un valore del gettone compreso tra mezzo centesimo e 10 €.\nLa volatilità di Druids Dream è medio-alta, il che significa che ci potranno essere delle vincite piccole e costanti ma che occorrerà pazientare un pochino se si vorranno mettere le mani su premi di un certo valore, con il jackpot stabilito a 200 volte l’importo della puntata.\nPer quanto riguarda il ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP), Druids Dream non offre nulla di speciale, ma con il suo 96% tondo, rientra appieno nella media della maggior parte dei giochi di slot.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Druids Dream\nIn Druids Dream non sono presenti le carte da gioco e tutti i simboli che si alternano sui rulli sono legati al tema.\nTroviamo tra i simboli regolari delle pietre magiche di diversi colori, dei lupi, dei  gufi, due strumenti musicali e dei lupi bianchi che, tra tutti, sono i simboli che hanno il valore più alto.\nIl Wild è rappresentato semplicemente dalla scritta corrispondente, come singolo può cadere solamente sui rulli 1, 4 e 5, mentre lo si può trovare impilato sui rulli 2 e 4.\nSono presenti anche due simboli Scatter, identificati dai druidi, uomo e donna, che in questo caso hanno la funzione di jolly. La cosa interessante è che quando sullo stesso rullo compaiono insieme Wild e Scatter si avvia la funzione Respins, che permette di allungare le giocate e di avere più possibilità di mettere le mani su dei bei premi!\n",

            "response": "Druid's Dream - a mystical slot created by the reputable software developer NetEnt - takes players on a journey through the enchanted world of Celtic mythology, filled with forest creatures and magical symbols. In Celtic tradition, druids were ancient priests who held great influence not only in religion but also in politics. And while this slot game romanticizes the figure of druids, it still carries an air of authenticity. \n\nThe graphics of Druid's Dream are beautifully rendered, immersing players in the mystical atmosphere of the game. The predominant color is green, from the forest backdrop to the costumes and headgear of the characters. The symbols adorning the reels are intricately designed to resemble elements found in nature, offering a mesmerizing and engaging gaming experience.\n\nThe game structure is traditional, with five reels and three rows, and 40 paylines. The range of betting options is quite wide, from a low stake of 20 cents to an exciting max bet of up to €400. The game's volatility is medium-high, meaning that while small wins are common, larger payouts require a bit more patience. The maximum payout is worth 200 times the player's bet.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Druid's Dream does not include typical card symbols. Instead, the reels are filled with mystical gems of various colors, wolves, owls, musical instruments, and white wolves - high-paying symbols. The wild, represented by the word itself, appears on reels 1, 4, and 5 as a single icon or can be stacked on reels 2 and 4. There are also two scatter symbols - a male and a female druid - which act as wilds. When a wild and scatter appear on the same reel, the respins feature is triggered, extending gameplay and providing additional chances for big payouts. \n\nOverall, Druid's Dream is an alluring and captivating slot game that transports players into a world of wonder and mysticism. Its beautiful graphics and unique features make it a great choice for experienced gamblers who appreciate top-notch games that offer thrilling and lucrative payouts.",
