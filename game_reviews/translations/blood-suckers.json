This RTP rate is above average for online slot games and is an attractive feature for players looking to get consistent wins while enjoying the game.\n\nSymbols\n\nBlood Suckers features symbols that are all related to the vampire theme, including different vampire characters, garlic, a magic potion, and a Bible with a crucifix.

The symbols are well-designed and fit with the game's overall theme.\n\nBonus Game\n\nThe Bonus game in Blood Suckers is triggered by landing three Bonus symbols on the reels.

This high RTP ensures players win more consistently.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay in Blood Suckers is straightforward. It is a 5-reel slot game with 25 paylines, without the Avalanche mode present in other NetEnt titles. The game features only traditional Wild and Scatter symbols and a single Bonus game. Players looking for a simple and gratifying slot game will appreciate Blood Suckers.\n\nGraphics\n\nBlood Suckers has a visually pleasing design, with graphics that resemble a comic book. The symbols are accurately represented and all related to the supernatural theme. The background is well-made, and traces of blood in thick fog add to the eerie atmosphere of the game.\n\nBonus features\n\nBlood Suckers has two bonus features: Free Spins and the Bonus game. The Free Spins feature is triggered when you land three or more Scatter symbols. It awards players 10 free spins with a 3x multiplier on all winnings. The Bonus game is triggered when you land three or more Bonus symbols. In the Bonus game, players have to choose from twelve coffins to reveal vampires to defeat and win cash prizes. Three of the coffins contain harmless bats which immediately end the bonus game. These bonus features offer exciting opportunities to win big.\n\nSymbol representation\n\nBlood Suckers uses symbols related to the theme of vampires and supernatural beings, with good attention to detail. The symbols range from different types of vampires to tools used to fight them, such as garlic, a magic potion, and a Bible with a crucifix. The Wild symbol depicts a vampire biting a blonde girl and replaces all other symbols except for the Scatter and Bonus symbols. The Scatter symbol is a Vampire Bride, and when three or more appear on the reels, players win free spins. Lastly, the Bonus symbol depicts a stake and an axe and triggers the Bonus game when players land three or more on the reels.\n\n        \n            ",

In recent years, we have seen a true invasion of vampires, who have forcefully taken a prominent place in cinema, literature, music and even slot machines!\nBlood Suckers is a fairly simple slot game in terms of gameplay, without special features except for the traditional ones related to Wild and Scatter symbols, and a single Bonus game.\nWe don't have the Avalanche mode, which is instead present in several NetEnt titles, but we have a RTP of 98%, above average, guaranteeing consistent wins.\nThe graphics are also simple but very well-taken care of, starting from the background in which some traces of blood stand out in thick fog, a sign of the latest banquets of the lords of the night! The symbols are accurately reproduced in a style that resembles a comic book.\nOverall, Blood Suckers is a visually pleasing and gratifying slot game, suitable for those who aim straight for the point without getting lost in special effects or features.\n\nSymbols, Wild and Scatter\nThe symbols in Blood Suckers are all related to the world of creatures of darkness, starting from eerie characters with pale skin and reaching the tools that, as legend has it, should serve to defeat the vampires.\nWe find vampires of different appearance, from the one who toasts with a glass of blood to the one with his hands folded on his chest, who seems to have just come out of a coffin; then we have a slice of garlic, a magic potion, and a Bible with a crucifix.\nThe Wild symbol depicts a vampire intent on sucking blood from the neck of a blonde girl: this symbol acts as a wild card and can replace all others except for the Scatter and the Bonus to complete a winning combination.\nThe Scatter is instead represented by a bloody and disturbing Vampire Bride, and if it appears at least three times on the reels, regardless of the position occupied, it allows you to get 10 free spins, in which all winnings are tripled!\nBlood Suckers: Bonus Game\nThe Bonus symbol depicts a wooden stake and an axe, crossed on an image of a coffin: when it appears three times on the reels, starting from right to left, it gives access to the Bonus game. The screen changes, and we find ourselves in a sort of funeral chamber, where twelve coffins are aligned: by clicking on them, they will be opened, and to obtain winnings, you must kill the vampires resting inside them. Be careful though, out of twelve coffins, in three, you will not find the vampire to be defeated but harmless bats: if they come out of the coffin, the Bonus game immediately ends!\n        ",
