With its 5 reels and whopping 1,024 ways to win, this game is sure to blow the wind in your sails. But that's not all, Five Pirates has more bonus features than you can shake a parrot at, including five different free spin options that truly make this slot game a cut above the rest.\n\nWith such a wide range of pirate-themed slots out there, it takes a lot to stand out from the crowd. But Lightning Box has done just that with Five Pirates by perfectly capturing the romantic spirit of adventure that characterizes life on the open ocean. The game's reels are set against a shimmering blue sea with waves cresting in the background, while a golden sunset provides a calming contrast.\n\nThe game features both a male pirate and a female pirate as wild and scatter symbols respectively. Both of these characters embody the game's graphic style, which may not be to everyone's taste but certainly adds to the overall atmosphere.\n\nVisuals aside, Five Pirates may not be the most cutting-edge game regarding graphics, but this 1,024 ways-to-win slot machine is certainly worth its weight in gold when it comes to bonus features. With each spin of this swashbuckling game promising the potential for winning action or an exciting pick'em-style gameplay, you simply cannot go wrong. Plus, with a jackpot of 200,000 credits on offer, you'd be a fool not to give Five Pirates a spin.\n\nThe pirate is the game's wild symbol, substituting for all other symbols except the scatter bonus. It appears only on reels 2 and 4. The scatter is the female pirate, also the game's most rewarding symbol, paying out 2, 5, 8, and 40 times your stake for 2, 3, 4, or 5 of them on a payline respectively.\n\nIf you hit 2, 3, or 4 from left to right on the reels, you'll activate the Hold N Spin feature. The female pirate is then locked in place and covers the entire reel, while the remaining reels are respun up to 3 times to achieve the scatter on all 5 reels. If you manage this, you'll activate the Pirate Barrel Bonus feature.\n\nYour goal in this feature is to climb to the top of the mast to get the best combination of free spins and multipliers possible. Once inside, choose one of the 5 pirates, each of whom offers different free spin/multiplier options. Then choose a barrel from the highlighted row, revealing either a green arrow or a cash prize. The arrow takes you to a higher level, and then choose another barrel that will give you an extra free spin or increase your multiplier. The objective is to reach the top for the maximum number of free spins and the highest multiplier.\n\nOnce the free spins start, you can activate the Hold N Spin feature to give yourself a chance to retrieve the bonus, which will result in more free spins. You'll play the free spins with the multiplier with which you're playing. This means that you could potentially play with 14 free spins and a multiplier of up to 15x (if you choose pirate 5).\n\nOverall, Five Pirates is a high-volatility offering with a maximum win of 5,000 times your stake on each free spin! Playable on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices (including iOS and Android) for stakes ranging from 40 cents to 50 euros per spin, this pirate-themed game allows you to navigate the seven seas with a crew of cutthroats to loot your enemies and plunder their treasures.\n\nIf you're a fan of pirate-themed slots, then be sure to try Red Lady by Novomatic, another highly volatile offering that's sure to keep the adventure alive!",

            "response": "Five Pirates\nHow many pirates does it take to make a slot machine worthy of the daring spirit of pirates? Well, if we consider Lightning Box's game as something to analyze, the answer would be Five Pirates.\n\nWith 5 reels and 1,024 different ways to win, this game is sure to give you a thrill. Plus, this video slot machine has more bonus features than you can shake a parrot at, including five different free spin options that give this slot machine its title.\n\nPractically every software company has at least one pirate-themed slot in their catalog. Lightning Box's attempt to create a pirate-themed video slot game is a brave one, and they have done well to capture the sense of romance and adventure that comes with life on the high seas. As such, the game's reels are set on a bright blue sea with rippling waves, while a golden sunset offers a soothing contrast.\n\nFive Pirates also features a couple of sea characters, with a male pirate acting as the wild icon and a female pirate as the game's scatter symbol. Both of these characters perfectly embody the game's graphical style, which may not be to everyone's taste.\n\nA graphics style with an eye patch\nVisually, Five Pirates is set at sea on a ship full of treasures and looks like a terrestrial game. With cartoon-style graphics, the symbols on the reels include pirate-themed playing cards (A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9) as well as treasure maps, chests, parrots, cannons, and gold doubloons.\n\nFive Pirates may not be cutting-edge when it comes to graphics, but this 1,024-ways-to-win slot machine is certainly worth its weight in doubloons when it comes to bonus features. As such, every spin of this swashbuckling game promises the potential for some winning action, if not for an exciting pick'em-style gameplay. Plus, with a jackpot of 200,000 credits up for grabs, you would be a scoundrel to refuse a few spins on this Lightning Box slot machine.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nThe pirate is the wild symbol and can replace all symbols except the scatter bonus - it only appears on reels 2 and 4. The scatter is the pirate wench, who is also the most rewarding symbol as she can trigger 2, 5, 8, or 40 times your bet when appearing 2, 3, 4, or 5 times on a payline.\n\nIf you get 2, 3, or 4 from left to right on the reels, you will trigger the Hold N Spin feature. The lass is then locked in place and covers the entire reel. The remaining reels are then respun up to 3 times to get the scatter on all 5 reels. If you succeed, you will trigger the Pirate Barrel Bonus feature.\n\nHere, your goal is to climb to the top of the rigging to get the best combination of free spins and multiplier possible. Once inside, you must select 1 of the 5 pirates - each of them offers different free spin/multiplier options: Pirate 1, win 8-15 free spins with a 1-5x multiplier; Pirate 2, win 7-13 free spins with a 2-6x multiplier; Pirate 3, win 6-11 free spins with a 3-8x multiplier; Pirate 4, win 5-9 free spins with a 4-10x multiplier; Pirate 5, win 4-7 free spins with a 5-15x multiplier.\n\nOnce you've chosen your pirate, you'll pick a barrel from the highlighted row - you'll reveal either a green arrow or a cash prize. The arrow takes you to a higher level. Then choose another barrel that will give you an extra free spin or increase the multiplier. The goal is to reach the top to get the maximum number of free spins and the highest multiplier.\n\nOnce the free spins start, you can activate the Hold N Spin feature to give you the chance to retrieve the bonus which will result in more free spins - you will play the free spins with the multiplier you're playing. This means you could potentially play with 14 free spins with a multiplier up to 15x (if you chose pirate 5).\n\nPersonally, I would opt for pirate 5 as the big 15x multiplier is the most appealing and potentially rewarding - I have had wins of almost 2,000x my stake from 7 free spins and a 15x multiplier. I found Five Pirates to be a high-volatility offering with maximum wins of 5,000x your stake on every free spin!\n\nFive Pirates is powered by Lightning Box Games and has 5 reels, 4 rows, and 1,024 ways to win. Playable on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices (including iOS and Android) from 40 cents to 50€ per spin, this pirate-themed game allows you to navigate the high seas with a crew of cutthroats to loot the enemies and take their booty.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nGraphically, Five Pirates may not be the best looking slot, but in terms of gameplay, it's probably Lightning Box Games' best offering so far. To continue playing with the pirate-themed theme, I also recommend trying Novomatic's Red Lady, which is also highly volatile.",

Well, if we consider Lightning Box's game as something to analyze, the answer would be Five Pirates.\n\nWith 5 reels and 1,024 different ways to win, this game is sure to give you a thrill. Plus, this video slot machine has more bonus features than you can shake a parrot at, including five different free spin options that give this slot machine its title.\n\nPractically every software company has at least one pirate-themed slot in their catalog. Lightning Box's attempt to create a pirate-themed video slot game is a brave one, and they have done well to capture the sense of romance and adventure that comes with life on the high seas. As such, the game's reels are set on a bright blue sea with rippling waves, while a golden sunset offers a soothing contrast.\n\nFive Pirates also features a couple of sea characters, with a male pirate acting as the wild icon and a female pirate as the game's scatter symbol. Both of these characters perfectly embody the game's graphical style, which may not be to everyone's taste.\n\nA graphics style with an eye patch\nVisually, Five Pirates is set at sea on a ship full of treasures and looks like a terrestrial game. With cartoon-style graphics, the symbols on the reels include pirate-themed playing cards (A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9) as well as treasure maps, chests, parrots, cannons, and gold doubloons.\n\nFive Pirates may not be cutting-edge when it comes to graphics, but this 1,024-ways-to-win slot machine is certainly worth its weight in doubloons when it comes to bonus features. As such, every spin of this swashbuckling game promises the potential for some winning action, if not for an exciting pick'em-style gameplay. Plus, with a jackpot of 200,000 credits up for grabs, you would be a scoundrel to refuse a few spins on this Lightning Box slot machine.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nThe pirate is the wild symbol and can replace all symbols except the scatter bonus - it only appears on reels 2 and 4. The scatter is the pirate wench, who is also the most rewarding symbol as she can trigger 2, 5, 8, or 40 times your bet when appearing 2, 3, 4, or 5 times on a payline.\n\nIf you get 2, 3, or 4 from left to right on the reels, you will trigger the Hold N Spin feature. The lass is then locked in place and covers the entire reel. The remaining reels are then respun up to 3 times to get the scatter on all 5 reels. If you succeed, you will trigger the Pirate Barrel Bonus feature.\n\nHere, your goal is to climb to the top of the rigging to get the best combination of free spins and multiplier possible. Once inside, you must select 1 of the 5 pirates - each of them offers different free spin/multiplier options: Pirate 1, win 8-15 free spins with a 1-5x multiplier; Pirate 2, win 7-13 free spins with a 2-6x multiplier; Pirate 3, win 6-11 free spins with a 3-8x multiplier; Pirate 4, win 5-9 free spins with a 4-10x multiplier; Pirate 5, win 4-7 free spins with a 5-15x multiplier.\n\nOnce you've chosen your pirate, you'll pick a barrel from the highlighted row - you'll reveal either a green arrow or a cash prize. The arrow takes you to a higher level. Then choose another barrel that will give you an extra free spin or increase the multiplier. The goal is to reach the top to get the maximum number of free spins and the highest multiplier.\n\nOnce the free spins start, you can activate the Hold N Spin feature to give you the chance to retrieve the bonus which will result in more free spins - you will play the free spins with the multiplier you're playing. This means you could potentially play with 14 free spins with a multiplier up to 15x (if you chose pirate 5).\n\nPersonally, I would opt for pirate 5 as the big 15x multiplier is the most appealing and potentially rewarding - I have had wins of almost 2,000x my stake from 7 free spins and a 15x multiplier. I found Five Pirates to be a high-volatility offering with maximum wins of 5,000x your stake on every free spin!\n\nFive Pirates is powered by Lightning Box Games and has 5 reels, 4 rows, and 1,024 ways to win. Playable on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices (including iOS and Android) from 40 cents to 50€ per spin, this pirate-themed game allows you to navigate the high seas with a crew of cutthroats to loot the enemies and take their booty.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nGraphically, Five Pirates may not be the best looking slot, but in terms of gameplay, it's probably Lightning Box Games' best offering so far. To continue playing with the pirate-themed theme, I also recommend trying Novomatic's Red Lady, which is also highly volatile."

Well, if we consider Lightning Box's game as something to analyze, the answer would be Five Pirates.\n\nWith 5 reels and 1,024 different ways to win, this game is sure to give you a thrill. Plus, this video slot machine has more bonus features than you can shake a parrot at, including five different free spin options that give this slot machine its title.\n\nPractically every software company has at least one pirate-themed slot in their catalog. Lightning Box's attempt to create a pirate-themed video slot game is a brave one, and they have done well to capture the sense of romance and adventure that comes with life on the high seas. As such, the game's reels are set on a bright blue sea with rippling waves, while a golden sunset offers a soothing contrast.\n\nFive Pirates also features a couple of sea characters, with a male pirate acting as the wild icon and a female pirate as the game's scatter symbol. Both of these characters perfectly embody the game's graphical style, which may not be to everyone's taste.\n\nA graphics style with an eye patch\nVisually, Five Pirates is set at sea on a ship full of treasures and looks like a terrestrial game. With cartoon-style graphics, the symbols on the reels include pirate-themed playing cards (A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9) as well as treasure maps, chests, parrots, cannons, and gold doubloons.\n\nFive Pirates may not be cutting-edge when it comes to graphics, but this 1,024-ways-to-win slot machine is certainly worth its weight in doubloons when it comes to bonus features. As such, every spin of this swashbuckling game promises the potential for some winning action, if not for an exciting pick'em-style gameplay. Plus, with a jackpot of 200,000 credits up for grabs, you would be a scoundrel to refuse a few spins on this Lightning Box slot machine.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nThe pirate is the wild symbol and can replace all symbols except the scatter bonus - it only appears on reels 2 and 4. The scatter is the pirate wench, who is also the most rewarding symbol as she can trigger 2, 5, 8, or 40 times your bet when appearing 2, 3, 4, or 5 times on a payline.\n\nIf you get 2, 3, or 4 from left to right on the reels, you will trigger the Hold N Spin feature. The lass is then locked in place and covers the entire reel. The remaining reels are then respun up to 3 times to get the scatter on all 5 reels. If you succeed, you will trigger the Pirate Barrel Bonus feature.\n\nHere, your goal is to climb to the top of the rigging to get the best combination of free spins and multiplier possible. Once inside, you must select 1 of the 5 pirates - each of them offers different free spin/multiplier options: Pirate 1, win 8-15 free spins with a 1-5x multiplier; Pirate 2, win 7-13 free spins with a 2-6x multiplier; Pirate 3, win 6-11 free spins with a 3-8x multiplier; Pirate 4, win 5-9 free spins with a 4-10x multiplier; Pirate 5, win 4-7 free spins with a 5-15x multiplier.\n\nOnce you've chosen your pirate, you'll pick a barrel from the highlighted row - you'll reveal either a green arrow or a cash prize. The arrow takes you to a higher level. Then choose another barrel that will give you an extra free spin or increase the multiplier. The goal is to reach the top to get the maximum number of free spins and the highest multiplier.\n\nOnce the free spins start, you can activate the Hold N Spin feature to give you the chance to retrieve the bonus which will result in more free spins - you will play the free spins with the multiplier you're playing. This means you could potentially play with 14 free spins with a multiplier up to 15x (if you chose pirate 5).\n\nPersonally, I would opt for pirate 5 as the big 15x multiplier is the most appealing and potentially rewarding - I have had wins of almost 2,000x my stake from 7 free spins and a 15x multiplier. I found Five Pirates to be a high-volatility offering with maximum wins of 5,000x your stake on every free spin!\n\nFive Pirates is powered by Lightning Box Games and has 5 reels, 4 rows, and 1,024 ways to win. Playable on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices (including iOS and Android) from 40 cents to 50€ per spin, this pirate-themed game allows you to navigate the high seas with a crew of cutthroats to loot the enemies and take their booty.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nGraphically, Five Pirates may not be the best looking slot, but in terms of gameplay, it's probably Lightning Box Games' best offering so far. To continue playing with the pirate-themed theme, I also recommend trying Novomatic's Red Lady, which is also highly volatile.\n            ",

It has 5 reels, 4 rows, and 1,024 ways to win. The game is accessible on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. The minimum bet is 40 cents and the maximum 50€ per spin.\n\nPirate theme and symbols\n\nFive Pirates is set at sea on a ship full of treasures and features cartoon-style graphics. The symbols on the reels include pirate-themed playing cards, treasure maps, chests, parrots, cannons, and gold doubloons. The game's reels are set on a bright blue sea with rippling waves, while a golden sunset offers a calming contrast.\n\nBonus features and free spins\n\nFive Pirates has several bonus features, including five different free spin options. The wild symbol is the pirate, which can replace all symbols except the scatter bonus - it only appears on reels 2 and 4. The scatter is the pirate wench, who can trigger 2, 5, 8, or 40 times your bet when appearing 2, 3, 4, or 5 times on a payline. Players can trigger the Hold N Spin feature by getting 2, 3, or 4 from left to right on the reels. The lass is then locked in place and covers the entire reel. The remaining reels are then respun up to 3 times to get the scatter on all 5 reels. If successful, players will trigger the Pirate Barrel Bonus feature.\n\nHold N Spin feature\n\nThe Hold N Spin feature is triggered by getting 2, 3, or 4 from left to right on the reels. The lass is then locked in place and covers the entire reel. The remaining reels are then respun up to 3 times to get the scatter on all 5 reels. If successful, players will trigger the Pirate Barrel Bonus feature.\n\nPirate Barrel Bonus feature\n\nOnce the Pirate Barrel Bonus feature is triggered, players must pick 1 of the 5 pirates - each of them offers different free spin/multiplier options. Players then pick a barrel from the highlighted row - they will reveal either a green arrow or a cash prize. The arrow takes players to a higher level. Players then choose another barrel that will give them an extra free spin or increase the multiplier. The aim is to reach the top to get the maximum number of free spins and the highest multiplier.\n\nJackpot and potential winnings\n\nFive Pirates has a jackpot of 200,000 credits up for grabs. The game is high-volatility and has a potential maximum win of 5,000x your stake on every free spin. The Hold N Spin feature allows players to retrieve the bonus which will result in more free spins - players will play the free spins with the multiplier they're playing. This means they could potentially play with 14 free spins with a multiplier up to 15x.\n\nSimilar games and alternatives\n\nGraphically, Five Pirates may not be the best looking slot, but in terms of gameplay, it's Lightning Box Games' best offering so far. If players want to continue playing with the pirate-themed theme, we recommend trying Novomatic's Red Lady, which is also highly volatile.\n\n        \n            ",

Well, if we consider Lightning Box's game as something to analyze, the answer would be Five Pirates.\n\nWith 5 reels and 1,024 different ways to win, this game is sure to give you a thrill. Plus, this video slot machine has more bonus features than you can shake a parrot at, including five different free spin options that give this slot machine its title.\n\nPractically every software company has at least one pirate-themed slot in their catalog. Lightning Box's attempt to create a pirate-themed video slot game is a brave one, and they have done well to capture the sense of romance and adventure that comes with life on the high seas. As such, the game's reels are set on a bright blue sea with rippling waves, while a golden sunset offers a soothing contrast.\n\nFive Pirates also features a couple of sea characters, with a male pirate acting as the wild icon and a female pirate as the game's scatter symbol. Both of these characters perfectly embody the game's graphical style, which may not be to everyone's taste.\n\nA graphics style with an eye patch\nVisually, Five Pirates is set at sea on a ship full of treasures and looks like a terrestrial game. With cartoon-style graphics, the symbols on the reels include pirate-themed playing cards (A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9) as well as treasure maps, chests, parrots, cannons, and gold doubloons.\n\nFive Pirates may not be cutting-edge when it comes to graphics, but this 1,024-ways-to-win slot machine is certainly worth its weight in doubloons when it comes to bonus features. As such, every spin of this swashbuckling game promises the potential for some winning action, if not for an exciting pick'em-style gameplay. Plus, with a jackpot of 200,000 credits up for grabs, you would be a scoundrel to refuse a few spins on this Lightning Box slot machine.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nThe pirate is the wild symbol and can replace all symbols except the scatter bonus - it only appears on reels 2 and 4. The scatter is the pirate wench, who is also the most rewarding symbol as she can trigger 2, 5, 8, or 40 times your bet when appearing 2, 3, 4, or 5 times on a payline.\n\nIf you get 2, 3, or 4 from left to right on the reels, you will trigger the Hold N Spin feature. The lass is then locked in place and covers the entire reel. The remaining reels are then respun up to 3 times to get the scatter on all 5 reels. If you succeed, you will trigger the Pirate Barrel Bonus feature.\n\nHere, your goal is to climb to the top of the rigging to get the best combination of free spins and multiplier possible. Once inside, you must select 1 of the 5 pirates - each of them offers different free spin/multiplier options: Pirate 1, win 8-15 free spins with a 1-5x multiplier; Pirate 2, win 7-13 free spins with a 2-6x multiplier; Pirate 3, win 6-11 free spins with a 3-8x multiplier; Pirate 4, win 5-9 free spins with a 4-10x multiplier; Pirate 5, win 4-7 free spins with a 5-15x multiplier.\n\nOnce you've chosen your pirate, you'll pick a barrel from the highlighted row - you'll reveal either a green arrow or a cash prize. The arrow takes you to a higher level. Then choose another barrel that will give you an extra free spin or increase the multiplier. The goal is to reach the top to get the maximum number of free spins and the highest multiplier.\n\nOnce the free spins start, you can activate the Hold N Spin feature to give you the chance to retrieve the bonus which will result in more free spins - you will play the free spins with the multiplier you're playing. This means you could potentially play with 14 free spins with a multiplier up to 15x (if you chose pirate 5).\n\nPersonally, I would opt for pirate 5 as the big 15x multiplier is the most appealing and potentially rewarding - I have had wins of almost 2,000x my stake from 7 free spins and a 15x multiplier. I found Five Pirates to be a high-volatility offering with maximum wins of 5,000x your stake on every free spin!\n\nFive Pirates is powered by Lightning Box Games and has 5 reels, 4 rows, and 1,024 ways to win. Playable on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices (including iOS and Android) from 40 cents to 50€ per spin, this pirate-themed game allows you to navigate the high seas with a crew of cutthroats to loot the enemies and take their booty.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nGraphically, Five Pirates may not be the best looking slot, but in terms of gameplay, it's probably Lightning Box Games' best offering so far. To continue playing with the pirate-themed theme, I also recommend trying Novomatic's Red Lady, which is also highly volatile.\n            ",

Well, if we consider Lightning Box's game as something to analyze, the answer would be Five Pirates.\n\nWith 5 reels and 1,024 different ways to win, this game is sure to give you a thrill. Plus, this video slot machine has more bonus features than you can shake a parrot at, including five different free spin options that give this slot machine its title.\n\nPractically every software company has at least one pirate-themed slot in their catalog. Lightning Box's attempt to create a pirate-themed video slot game is a brave one, and they have done well to capture the sense of romance and adventure that comes with life on the high seas. As such, the game's reels are set on a bright blue sea with rippling waves, while a golden sunset offers a soothing contrast.\n\nFive Pirates also features a couple of sea characters, with a male pirate acting as the wild icon and a female pirate as the game's scatter symbol. Both of these characters perfectly embody the game's graphical style, which may not be to everyone's taste.\n\nA graphics style with an eye patch\nVisually, Five Pirates is set at sea on a ship full of treasures and looks like a terrestrial game. With cartoon-style graphics, the symbols on the reels include pirate-themed playing cards (A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9) as well as treasure maps, chests, parrots, cannons, and gold doubloons.\n\nFive Pirates may not be cutting-edge when it comes to graphics, but this 1,024-ways-to-win slot machine is certainly worth its weight in doubloons when it comes to bonus features. As such, every spin of this swashbuckling game promises the potential for some winning action, if not for an exciting pick'em-style gameplay. Plus, with a jackpot of 200,000 credits up for grabs, you would be a scoundrel to refuse a few spins on this Lightning Box slot machine.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nThe pirate is the wild symbol and can replace all symbols except the scatter bonus - it only appears on reels 2 and 4. The scatter is the pirate wench, who is also the most rewarding symbol as she can trigger 2, 5, 8, or 40 times your bet when appearing 2, 3, 4, or 5 times on a payline.\n\nIf you get 2, 3, or 4 from left to right on the reels, you will trigger the Hold N Spin feature. The lass is then locked in place and covers the entire reel. The remaining reels are then respun up to 3 times to get the scatter on all 5 reels. If you succeed, you will trigger the Pirate Barrel Bonus feature.\n\nHere, your goal is to climb to the top of the rigging to get the best combination of free spins and multiplier possible. Once inside, you must select 1 of the 5 pirates - each of them offers different free spin/multiplier options: Pirate 1, win 8-15 free spins with a 1-5x multiplier; Pirate 2, win 7-13 free spins with a 2-6x multiplier; Pirate 3, win 6-11 free spins with a 3-8x multiplier; Pirate 4, win 5-9 free spins with a 4-10x multiplier; Pirate 5, win 4-7 free spins with a 5-15x multiplier.\n\nOnce you've chosen your pirate, you'll pick a barrel from the highlighted row - you'll reveal either a green arrow or a cash prize. The arrow takes you to a higher level. Then choose another barrel that will give you an extra free spin or increase the multiplier. The goal is to reach the top to get the maximum number of free spins and the highest multiplier.\n\nOnce the free spins start, you can activate the Hold N Spin feature to give you the chance to retrieve the bonus which will result in more free spins - you will play the free spins with the multiplier you're playing. This means you could potentially play with 14 free spins with a multiplier up to 15x (if you chose pirate 5).\n\nPersonally, I would opt for pirate 5 as the big 15x multiplier is the most appealing and potentially rewarding - I have had wins of almost 2,000x my stake from 7 free spins and a 15x multiplier. I found Five Pirates to be a high-volatility offering with maximum wins of 5,000x your stake on every free spin!\n\nFive Pirates is powered by Lightning Box Games and has 5 reels, 4 rows, and 1,024 ways to win. Playable on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices (including iOS and Android) from 40 cents to 50€ per spin, this pirate-themed game allows you to navigate the high seas with a crew of cutthroats to loot the enemies and take their booty.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nGraphically, Five Pirates may not be the best looking slot, but in terms of gameplay, it's probably Lightning Box Games' best offering so far. To continue playing with the pirate-themed theme, I also recommend trying Novomatic's Red Lady, which is also highly volatile.\n        ",
