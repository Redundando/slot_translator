Whatever the truth is, the events narrated in the Arthurian cycle are considered by many to be the direct ancestors of the fantasy genre. And it couldn't be otherwise, since King Arthur lived in Camelot, a fortress that was located in a kingdom half networked and half enchanted, populated by magical creatures, wizards, spells and miraculous weapons.\n\nWith these premises, it's almost mandatory to expect a great job at the graphics level and indeed Jelly doesn't disappoint at all in this regard. As soon as you start the game, you're catapulted into the realm of Camelot, with a game grid embedded in the stone and two sculptures of dragons carved on the sides. Colored lights rise from the ground, while in the background, blurred, you can glimpse the walls of the castle. The buttons to play and adjust the bet are located to the right and left of the reels. The music accompanying the spins has an epic and engaging tone.\n\nThe Super Stake function to get free spins\n\nIn Fortune of Camelot we find ourselves facing a classic-cut grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 20, fixed, and on each of them it's possible to bet €0.01, so each spin will cost only €0.20. The automatic spins take us out of the burden of having to click the play button every time. From the same page, it's possible to activate the Turbo Spin function which allows you to accelerate the rotation of the reels. There's also the possibility to double the chance of getting Scatter symbols, essential to receive Free Spins. In this case, it will be necessary to purchase the Super Stake function by clicking on the appropriate button.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player (RTP) is set at 95.84%, while the volatility is high.\n\nMagic-rich bonuses\n\nIn Fortune of Camelot the symbols can be divided between low-level ones, represented by playing cards good for a royal flush, and high-level ones, namely the characters of the Round Table, Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Geoffrey and Merlin.\n\nThe sword is our Wild and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the Bonus sign. A minimum of three scatters gives us ten Free Spins. During the bonus game, every time a Wild lands on the reels, the multiplier on the left increases by x1. Moreover, it's possible that Merlin's magic, a special modifier that can transform a Wild into a stacked Wild or make single Wilds appear, will be activated.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I play Fortune of Camelot on my smartphone?\n\nCertainly, in fact this slot is available on any mobile device or pc.\n\nWhat's the theoretical return to the player of Fortune of Camelot?\n\nThe RTP of this slot is 95.84%.\n\nCan I buy Free Spins?\n\nNo, but you can use the Stake Logic function that doubles the chance of getting Free Spins.\n            ",

Whatever the truth is, the events narrated in the Arthurian cycle are considered by many to be the direct ancestors of the fantasy genre. And it couldn't be otherwise, since King Arthur lived in Camelot, a fortress that was located in a kingdom half networked and half enchanted, populated by magical creatures, wizards, spells and miraculous weapons.\n\nWith these premises, it's almost mandatory to expect a great job at the graphics level and indeed Jelly doesn't disappoint at all in this regard. As soon as you start the game, you're catapulted into the realm of Camelot, with a game grid embedded in the stone and two sculptures of dragons carved on the sides. Colored lights rise from the ground, while in the background, blurred, you can glimpse the walls of the castle. The buttons to play and adjust the bet are located to the right and left of the reels. The music accompanying the spins has an epic and engaging tone.\n\nThe Super Stake function to get free spins\n\nIn Fortune of Camelot we find ourselves facing a classic-cut grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 20, fixed, and on each of them it's possible to bet €0.01, so each spin will cost only €0.20. The automatic spins take us out of the burden of having to click the play button every time. From the same page, it's possible to activate the Turbo Spin function which allows you to accelerate the rotation of the reels. There's also the possibility to double the chance of getting Scatter symbols, essential to receive Free Spins. In this case, it will be necessary to purchase the Super Stake function by clicking on the appropriate button.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player (RTP) is set at 95.84%, while the volatility is high.\n\nMagic-rich bonuses\n\nIn Fortune of Camelot the symbols can be divided between low-level ones, represented by playing cards good for a royal flush, and high-level ones, namely the characters of the Round Table, Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Geoffrey and Merlin.\n\nThe sword is our Wild and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the Bonus sign. A minimum of three scatters gives us ten Free Spins. During the bonus game, every time a Wild lands on the reels, the multiplier on the left increases by x1. Moreover, it's possible that Merlin's magic, a special modifier that can transform a Wild into a stacked Wild or make single Wilds appear, will be activated.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I play Fortune of Camelot on my smartphone?\n\nCertainly, in fact this slot is available on any mobile device or pc.\n\nWhat's the theoretical return to the player of Fortune of Camelot?\n\nThe RTP of this slot is 95.84%.\n\nCan I buy Free Spins?\n\nNo, but you can use the Stake Logic function that doubles the chance of getting Free Spins.\n            ",
