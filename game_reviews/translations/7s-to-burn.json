The betting range is between €0.10 and €500.00 per spin. There are no automatic gameplay features in the normal mode. To activate the high roller mode, players must play 5 consecutive spins at a cost of around €20.00 per spin. The wild card, represented by a pair of burning sevens, acts differently depending on the mode chosen. The game's RTP is 95.01%.\n\nWinning potential and prizes\n\nDuring standard gameplay, the maximum payout is €125,000. While playing on high roller mode, the first prize will be lower, but the chances of winning will be higher thanks to more wild cards available. The game's high RTP also makes it a good choice for those looking to maximize their winnings.\n\nSymbols and design\n\n7's to Burn has a mix of fruity and classic symbols (including double sevens, bells, stars, watermelons, plums, lemons, oranges, cherries, and BAR symbols) set against a backdrop of blazing flames. The wild card is represented by a pair of burning sevens, which replaces regular seven symbols during standard play and all other symbols when in high roller mode.

At first glance, it seems like the classic fruit slot machine, with reels populated by traditional slot symbols such as Sevens, Stars, Bells, and other standard icons. Let's explore the distinctive features that make this slot machine so much fun to play!\n\nColorful and Fiery Gameplay\nThe game structure of this 3-reel, 5-payline slot machine can be played in both normal and high roller modes to give all players the maximum advantage. The reels are positioned against a backdrop of blazing flames. You can place bets from €0.10 to €500.00 per spin, making it great for both beginners and experienced gamblers. The game does not offer any standard automatic gameplay features. Instead, in high roller mode, you can play 5 consecutive spins at a cost of around €20.00 per spin. To win a prize, you must cover one of the paylines with symbols from the game. The RTP is fairly high, at 95.01%.\n\nFruit and Classic Symbols of 7's To Burn\nThis video slot features both fruity and classic symbols from vintage slots in a modern twist:\n\nDouble Sevens, Bells, and Stars award higher value payouts.\nFruit Symbols including Watermelons, Plums, Lemons, Oranges, Cherries, and BAR symbols pay lower value prizes.\nA pair of burning Sevens represents the wild card, which acts differently depending on the mode chosen.\n\nMore risk, More fun!\nDuring standard gameplay, the Burning Seven Wilds symbol (a pair of burning sevens) will only replace regular seven symbols. When playing in high roller mode, the wild card will replace all other symbols. In this second option, your chances of winning will be higher thanks to more wild cards available, but at the same time, the first prize will be lower. To access high roller mode, simply press the button on the right side of the reels and choose a preferred betting value starting at €20.00 per spin. While playing the 7's to Burn slot, you can win up to €125,000 in a single spin!\n\nWhat makes 7's to Burn so special?\nThe free 7's to Burn slot machine may initially seem like the usual standard fruit slot, but with the high roller option, the game can truly become a blazing match! In addition to the sharp graphics and lively sound, Barcrest has developed a game with bold colors suitable for all different levels of experience.
