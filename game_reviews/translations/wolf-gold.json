Se compaiono sui rulli almeno sei di questi simboli, si accederà a una serie di giri gratuiti in cui tutte le combinazioni vincenti di una singola linea di pagamento saranno pagate, e non solo la più alta come succede invece nel gioco regolare; oltretutto, nel conteggio finale della vincita saranno inclusi anche i valori indicati nei simboli speciali.\n",

And boy, does Pragmatic Play deliver. The slot’s logo features a wolf with a captivating gaze, staring against a large full moon. Talk about intimidating! But don't worry, this wolf is your friend. He’ll help you score some big wins as you spin those reels.</p><p>I have to hand it to Pragmatic Play – they’ve really done their research when it comes to the details of this game. The symbols on the reels include various wildlife native to the American desert, such as bison, horses, and eagles. The attention to detail is impressive, down to the slight howling wind you hear as you spin the reels. This game truly is a work of art, with the perfect blend of theme, graphics, and gameplay.</p>\"}"

There are no 3D animations or special effects, but the engaging soundtrack includes animal sounds and music. Overall, the graphics are aesthetically pleasing and captivating.\n\nSymbols\n\nWolf Gold has both themed and non-themed symbols, including playing cards from J to Ace and various animals such as eagles, wild horses, pumas, and bison. The wolf is the Wild symbol and can replace all other symbols except for the Scatter. The Scatter symbol is represented by a desert landscape and triggers many free spins.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nWolf Gold features Money symbols, which are blue spheres that indicate cash prizes and can lead to the game's Mini, Major, and Mega jackpots. If six or more Money symbols appear on the reels, a series of free spins will activate, paying out all winning combinations on a single payline, and including values from the Money symbols in the final payout count.\n\nPayouts\n\nWith a maximum payout of X 200 times the bet, Wolf Gold has a medium volatility and a Return to Player (RTP) rate of 96%. The different animal symbols have varying values when forming a winning combination, and the Money symbols can lead to the game's three jackpots: Mini, Major, and Mega.\n\nGameplay\n\nWolf Gold has five reels and 25 paylines, with a minimum bet amount of €0.25 and a maximum bet amount of €125. The game has an engaging soundtrack and beautiful graphics, with the Wolf symbol acting as the game's joker and the Scatter symbol triggering free spins. The addition of Money symbols and the three jackpots add excitement and increased payout potential to the game.\n\n        \n            ",

If at least six of these symbols appear on the reels, a series of free spins will be activated in which all winning combinations on a single payline will be paid, not just the highest as in the regular game; furthermore, the values indicated in the special symbols will also be included in the final payout count.\n        ",
