Since then, Jeff Waters' thrash metal band has produced numerous records and toured around the world, bringing unforgettable hits such as \"Phantasmagorica\" and \"The Fun Palace\" with them. Now, in 2020, as the band releases its seventeenth album, Ballistic, Sadistic, Play’N’Go has appropriately released a stunning slot game that pays tribute to the band's legacy.\nRight from the start, Annihilator's graphics are carefully and meticulously detailed, as is almost always the case when a slot game is dedicated to a musical band. Set in a grand and eerie villa, the symbols depict characters from the band's plentiful album covers. Beneath the reel set, you'll find the game's informative buttons, including the ones that adjust the game's settings, such as wagering options, spinning reels, and autoplay. Not surprisingly, the game's sound is comprised of the band's greatest hits, which you can customize by clicking on the playlist button.\nAnnihilator's Key Features:\nThe game's grid consists of a traditional 5x3 setup, ten pay lines, and has a theoretical return to player rate of 96.2%. The wagering range varies from a minimum of €0.10 to €100 per spin, and the maximum payout is a whopping 5,000 times your wager. Expanding wilds, scatter symbols, and bonus rounds provide you with great opportunities for free spins and lucrative wins.\nSymbols and Features:\nAnnihilator consists of several symbols that vary in terms of their value. The card symbols from ten to ace pay a lower amount than other symbols. The highest-value symbols include the cover art from Annihilator - the album from 2010 - enclosed in a frame, a swallow-tailed electric guitar, and a woman holding a doll, who also appeared on the band's debut album, Alice in Hell.\nThe scatter symbol is represented by a devil from the album Refresh the Demon. If you land three scatters, the Set the World on Fire round is triggered, which gives you eight free spins.\nJeff Waters represents the wild symbol, which substitutes all symbols except the scatter and bonus symbols. He expands to cover the entire reel and remains active until a win occurs. Every so often, the wild symbol creates a line of fire that occupies various positions on the reel. If another wild symbol lands in one of these positions, it also expands to cover the entire line, resulting in a substantial win.\nIn addition to the scatter and wild symbols, there's also a bonus symbol represented by the doll from Annihilator's debut album. If you land three bonus symbols, the special Fun Palace round is triggered, where you have to choose from three sets of dolls to reveal a secret prize.\nAnnihilator not only features immersive graphics and music but also offers rich rewards.

Since then, Jeff Waters' thrash metal band has produced numerous records and toured around the world, bringing unforgettable hits such as \"Phantasmagorica\" and \"The Fun Palace\" with them. Now, in 2020, as the band releases its seventeenth album, Ballistic, Sadistic, Play’N’Go has appropriately released a stunning slot game that pays tribute to the band's legacy.\nRight from the start, Annihilator's graphics are carefully and meticulously detailed, as is almost always the case when a slot game is dedicated to a musical band. Set in a grand and eerie villa, the symbols depict characters from the band's plentiful album covers. Beneath the reel set, you'll find the game's informative buttons, including the ones that adjust the game's settings, such as wagering options, spinning reels, and autoplay. Not surprisingly, the game's sound is comprised of the band's greatest hits, which you can customize by clicking on the playlist button.\nAnnihilator's Key Features:\nThe game's grid consists of a traditional 5x3 setup, ten pay lines, and has a theoretical return to player rate of 96.2%. The wagering range varies from a minimum of €0.10 to €100 per spin, and the maximum payout is a whopping 5,000 times your wager. Expanding wilds, scatter symbols, and bonus rounds provide you with great opportunities for free spins and lucrative wins.\nSymbols and Features:\nAnnihilator consists of several symbols that vary in terms of their value. The card symbols from ten to ace pay a lower amount than other symbols. The highest-value symbols include the cover art from Annihilator - the album from 2010 - enclosed in a frame, a swallow-tailed electric guitar, and a woman holding a doll, who also appeared on the band's debut album, Alice in Hell.\nThe scatter symbol is represented by a devil from the album Refresh the Demon. If you land three scatters, the Set the World on Fire round is triggered, which gives you eight free spins.\nJeff Waters represents the wild symbol, which substitutes all symbols except the scatter and bonus symbols. He expands to cover the entire reel and remains active until a win occurs. Every so often, the wild symbol creates a line of fire that occupies various positions on the reel. If another wild symbol lands in one of these positions, it also expands to cover the entire line, resulting in a substantial win.\nIn addition to the scatter and wild symbols, there's also a bonus symbol represented by the doll from Annihilator's debut album. If you land three bonus symbols, the special Fun Palace round is triggered, where you have to choose from three sets of dolls to reveal a secret prize.\nAnnihilator not only features immersive graphics and music but also offers rich rewards. Therefore, we highly recommend it to experienced gamblers, with the confidence that it will not disappoint.\n            ",

The game offers a wagering range that starts at €0.10 and goes up to €100 per spin. The slot has expanding wilds, scatter symbols, and bonus rounds that provide free spins and lucrative wins.\n\nMaximum Payout\n\nThe maximum payout for Annihilator is an impressive 5,000 times your wager.\n\nGraphics and Atmosphere\n\nAnnihilator has meticulously detailed graphics set in a grand and eerie villa, fitting for a metal band's legacy. The symbols depict characters from the band's album covers, and the game's buttons for adjusting gameplay settings, such as wagering options, spinning reels, and autoplay, are informative.

Since then, Jeff Waters' thrash metal band has produced numerous records and toured around the world, bringing unforgettable hits such as \"Phantasmagorica\" and \"The Fun Palace\" with them. Now, in 2020, as the band releases its seventeenth album, Ballistic, Sadistic, Play’N’Go has appropriately released a stunning slot game that pays tribute to the band's legacy.\nRight from the start, Annihilator's graphics are carefully and meticulously detailed, as is almost always the case when a slot game is dedicated to a musical band. Set in a grand and eerie villa, the symbols depict characters from the band's plentiful album covers. Beneath the reel set, you'll find the game's informative buttons, including the ones that adjust the game's settings, such as wagering options, spinning reels, and autoplay.

The wagering range varies from a minimum of €0.10 to €100 per spin, and the maximum payout is a whopping 5,000 times your wager. Expanding wilds, scatter symbols, and bonus rounds provide you with great opportunities for free spins and lucrative wins.\nSymbols and Features:\nAnnihilator consists of several symbols that vary in terms of their value. The card symbols from ten to ace pay a lower amount than other symbols. The highest-value symbols include the cover art from Annihilator - the album from 2010 - enclosed in a frame, a swallow-tailed electric guitar, and a woman holding a doll, who also appeared on the band's debut album, Alice in Hell.\nThe scatter symbol is represented by a devil from the album Refresh the Demon. If you land three scatters, the Set the World on Fire round is triggered, which gives you eight free spins.\nJeff Waters represents the wild symbol, which substitutes all symbols except the scatter and bonus symbols. He expands to cover the entire reel and remains active until a win occurs. Every so often, the wild symbol creates a line of fire that occupies various positions on the reel. If another wild symbol lands in one of these positions, it also expands to cover the entire line, resulting in a substantial win.\nIn addition to the scatter and wild symbols, there's also a bonus symbol represented by the doll from Annihilator's debut album.

Since then, Jeff Waters' thrash metal band has produced numerous records and toured around the world, bringing unforgettable hits such as \"Phantasmagorica\" and \"The Fun Palace\" with them. Now, in 2020, as the band releases its seventeenth album, Ballistic, Sadistic, Play’N’Go has appropriately released a stunning slot game that pays tribute to the band's legacy.\nRight from the start, Annihilator's graphics are carefully and meticulously detailed, as is almost always the case when a slot game is dedicated to a musical band. Set in a grand and eerie villa, the symbols depict characters from the band's plentiful album covers. Beneath the reel set, you'll find the game's informative buttons, including the ones that adjust the game's settings, such as wagering options, spinning reels, and autoplay. Not surprisingly, the game's sound is comprised of the band's greatest hits, which you can customize by clicking on the playlist button.\nAnnihilator's Key Features:\nThe game's grid consists of a traditional 5x3 setup, ten pay lines, and has a theoretical return to player rate of 96.2%. The wagering range varies from a minimum of €0.10 to €100 per spin, and the maximum payout is a whopping 5,000 times your wager. Expanding wilds, scatter symbols, and bonus rounds provide you with great opportunities for free spins and lucrative wins.\nSymbols and Features:\nAnnihilator consists of several symbols that vary in terms of their value. The card symbols from ten to ace pay a lower amount than other symbols. The highest-value symbols include the cover art from Annihilator - the album from 2010 - enclosed in a frame, a swallow-tailed electric guitar, and a woman holding a doll, who also appeared on the band's debut album, Alice in Hell.\nThe scatter symbol is represented by a devil from the album Refresh the Demon. If you land three scatters, the Set the World on Fire round is triggered, which gives you eight free spins.\nJeff Waters represents the wild symbol, which substitutes all symbols except the scatter and bonus symbols. He expands to cover the entire reel and remains active until a win occurs. Every so often, the wild symbol creates a line of fire that occupies various positions on the reel. If another wild symbol lands in one of these positions, it also expands to cover the entire line, resulting in a substantial win.\nIn addition to the scatter and wild symbols, there's also a bonus symbol represented by the doll from Annihilator's debut album. If you land three bonus symbols, the special Fun Palace round is triggered, where you have to choose from three sets of dolls to reveal a secret prize.\nAnnihilator not only features immersive graphics and music but also offers rich rewards. Therefore, we highly recommend it to experienced gamblers, with the confidence that it will not disappoint.\n        ",
