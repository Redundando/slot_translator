Yggdrasil's latest game, E-Force, is set in the town of Esterville where a group of warrior rabbits have the task of defending Easter eggs from the attacks of Dr. Zeppelin, a cunning fox who will stop at nothing to steal them away. These rabbits are not anonymous warriors - they are true heroes who have made the fortune of famous action movies such as Rambo, Commando, Chen/Bruce Lee, and Indiana Jones. The graphics are a small masterpiece with a cartoon style, enhanced by some very funny animations. Even the sound design has been carefully thought out with a catchy tune played with real instruments.\n\nE-Force features a 5x3 grid with 243 ways to win and a betting range from €0.10 to €100. The highest payout is 10,000 times the bet, and this can be achieved thanks to the bonuses we will describe in the next paragraph. You win by matching identical symbols on consecutive reels starting from the left and moving towards the right. Autoplay is also available here, allowing you to set a predetermined number of spins and let the game run automatically.

The eggs have a low value, while the four rabbits pay very well. Among them, Rambo is the most profitable symbol. When the same symbol appears multiple times on the same reel, the win is multiplied by the number of symbols. For example, if three symbols appear on the second reel, then the win is multiplied by three. Robocop is the wild symbol, but unlike most slots, it substitutes all symbols including the scatter. The fox is the scatter symbol, and three symbols will earn you three free spins, four symbols will grant you four, and so on. Moreover, the win will be multiplied by the number of scatters that triggered the bonus game. Each additional scatter or wild symbol will grant an additional free spin and increase the multiplier by one. The free spin feature can be purchased by paying 50 times the bet, giving access to 3 to 9 free spins, while with a sum of 500 times the bet, 15 free spins can be obtained.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\nCan I play E-Force on my smartphone?\nCertainly!

Yggdrasil's latest game, E-Force, is set in the town of Esterville where a group of warrior rabbits have the task of defending Easter eggs from the attacks of Dr. Zeppelin, a cunning fox who will stop at nothing to steal them away. These rabbits are not anonymous warriors - they are true heroes who have made the fortune of famous action movies such as Rambo, Commando, Chen/Bruce Lee, and Indiana Jones. The graphics are a small masterpiece with a cartoon style, enhanced by some very funny animations. Even the sound design has been carefully thought out with a catchy tune played with real instruments.\n\nE-Force features a 5x3 grid with 243 ways to win and a betting range from €0.10 to €100. The highest payout is 10,000 times the bet, and this can be achieved thanks to the bonuses we will describe in the next paragraph. You win by matching identical symbols on consecutive reels starting from the left and moving towards the right. Autoplay is also available here, allowing you to set a predetermined number of spins and let the game run automatically. The volatility is average, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96%.\n\nIn E-Force, the symbols can be divided into two groups: low level and high level. The eggs have a low value, while the four rabbits pay very well. Among them, Rambo is the most profitable symbol. When the same symbol appears multiple times on the same reel, the win is multiplied by the number of symbols. For example, if three symbols appear on the second reel, then the win is multiplied by three. Robocop is the wild symbol, but unlike most slots, it substitutes all symbols including the scatter. The fox is the scatter symbol, and three symbols will earn you three free spins, four symbols will grant you four, and so on. Moreover, the win will be multiplied by the number of scatters that triggered the bonus game. Each additional scatter or wild symbol will grant an additional free spin and increase the multiplier by one. The free spin feature can be purchased by paying 50 times the bet, giving access to 3 to 9 free spins, while with a sum of 500 times the bet, 15 free spins can be obtained.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\nCan I play E-Force on my smartphone?\nCertainly! It is a game created with HTML5 architecture, making it accessible on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones.\n\nWhere can I play E-Force?\nYou can play E-Force on any legal online casino with ministerial certification.\n\nWhat are the special symbols in E-Force?\nIn this game, we have the wild symbol, a wild card that replaces all symbols including the scatter. And of course, the scatter symbol that rewards with free spins.\n            ",

To portray the theme of the game, the graphics of this game are cartoonish; also, the game features timeless heroes like Rambo, Commando, Chen/Bruce Lee, and Indiana Jones, which makes it even more interesting.\n\nGraphics and Sound Design\n\nThe graphics of E-Force are visually appealing with a cartoonish style, which is further enhanced with humorous animations. The sound design of the game is also exquisite with a catchy tune played with real instruments. Overall, the combination of graphics and sound makes this game a delight for the players.\n\nGameplay (Grid Size, Paylines, Betting Range)\n\nE-Force features a 5x3 grid with 243 ways to win and a betting range from €0.10 to €100. The game has an average volatility level, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96%. Players can set the autoplay feature, which allows them to set a predetermined number of spins while allowing the game to run automatically.\n\nSymbols (Wilds, Scatters, High/Low Value Symbols)\n\nE-Force has two types of symbols- low-level and high-level. The low-level symbols are the Easter eggs, and the high-level symbols are represented by four rabbits - Rambo, Commando, Chen/Bruce Lee, and Indiana Jones. The rabbit symbols pay well, and Rambo is the most profitable. The wild symbol is the Robocop, which acts as a substitute for all other symbols. The scatter symbol is represented by the cunning fox Dr. Zeppelin, which offers free spins when three or more of the symbols land on the reels. Additionally, each scatter or wild that lands on the reels during free spins will grant players additional spins and increase the multiplier by one.\n\nFree Spin Feature\n\nE-Force offers a free spin feature triggered by the scatter symbol where players can earn up to 15 free spins. During the free spins, each additional wild or scatter that appears on the reels will grant additional spins and increase the multiplier by one. Players can also purchase the free spin feature at a cost of 50 times their bet, which gives them access to 3 to 9 free spins, while a cost of 500 times the bet gives them 15 free spins.\n\n        \n            ",

The highest payout is 10,000 times the bet, which can be achieved thanks to the bonuses granted by the game's special symbols. To win, you must match identical symbols on consecutive reels starting from the left and moving towards the right. Autoplay is also available here, allowing you to set a predetermined number of spins and let the game run automatically.

The four rabbit characters pay well, with Rambo being the most profitable. Eggs have a low value, and when the same symbol appears multiple times on the same reel, the win is multiplied by the number of symbols. The wild symbol is Robocop, which can substitute all other symbols, including the scatter. The scatter symbol, depicted as a fox, is the key to unlocking E-Force's free spin bonus round. Three scatter symbols award players three free spins, four award four free spins, and so on. Each additional scatter or wild symbol grants an extra free spin and increases the multiplier by one.\n\nBetting Range and Payout\n\nE-Force offers a wide betting range, with options starting as low as €0.10 and going up to €100.

Players can enjoy this game on any certified legal online casino.\n\n        \n            ",

Yggdrasil's latest game, E-Force, is set in the town of Esterville where a group of warrior rabbits have the task of defending Easter eggs from the attacks of Dr. Zeppelin, a cunning fox who will stop at nothing to steal them away. These rabbits are not anonymous warriors - they are true heroes who have made the fortune of famous action movies such as Rambo, Commando, Chen/Bruce Lee, and Indiana Jones. The graphics are a small masterpiece with a cartoon style, enhanced by some very funny animations. Even the sound design has been carefully thought out with a catchy tune played with real instruments.\n\nE-Force features a 5x3 grid with 243 ways to win and a betting range from €0.10 to €100. The highest payout is 10,000 times the bet, and this can be achieved thanks to the bonuses we will describe in the next paragraph. You win by matching identical symbols on consecutive reels starting from the left and moving towards the right. Autoplay is also available here, allowing you to set a predetermined number of spins and let the game run automatically. The volatility is average, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96%.\n\nIn E-Force, the symbols can be divided into two groups: low level and high level. The eggs have a low value, while the four rabbits pay very well. Among them, Rambo is the most profitable symbol. When the same symbol appears multiple times on the same reel, the win is multiplied by the number of symbols. For example, if three symbols appear on the second reel, then the win is multiplied by three. Robocop is the wild symbol, but unlike most slots, it substitutes all symbols including the scatter. The fox is the scatter symbol, and three symbols will earn you three free spins, four symbols will grant you four, and so on. Moreover, the win will be multiplied by the number of scatters that triggered the bonus game. Each additional scatter or wild symbol will grant an additional free spin and increase the multiplier by one. The free spin feature can be purchased by paying 50 times the bet, giving access to 3 to 9 free spins, while with a sum of 500 times the bet, 15 free spins can be obtained.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\nCan I play E-Force on my smartphone?\nCertainly! It is a game created with HTML5 architecture, making it accessible on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones.\n\nWhere can I play E-Force?\nYou can play E-Force on any legal online casino with ministerial certification.\n\nWhat are the special symbols in E-Force?\nIn this game, we have the wild symbol, a wild card that replaces all symbols including the scatter. And of course, the scatter symbol that rewards with free spins.\n            ",

Yggdrasil's latest game, E-Force, is set in the town of Esterville where a group of warrior rabbits have the task of defending Easter eggs from the attacks of Dr. Zeppelin, a cunning fox who will stop at nothing to steal them away. These rabbits are not anonymous warriors - they are true heroes who have made the fortune of famous action movies such as Rambo, Commando, Chen/Bruce Lee, and Indiana Jones. The graphics are a small masterpiece with a cartoon style, enhanced by some very funny animations. Even the sound design has been carefully thought out with a catchy tune played with real instruments.\n\nE-Force features a 5x3 grid with 243 ways to win and a betting range from €0.10 to €100. The highest payout is 10,000 times the bet, and this can be achieved thanks to the bonuses we will describe in the next paragraph. You win by matching identical symbols on consecutive reels starting from the left and moving towards the right. Autoplay is also available here, allowing you to set a predetermined number of spins and let the game run automatically. The volatility is average, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96%.\n\nIn E-Force, the symbols can be divided into two groups: low level and high level. The eggs have a low value, while the four rabbits pay very well. Among them, Rambo is the most profitable symbol. When the same symbol appears multiple times on the same reel, the win is multiplied by the number of symbols. For example, if three symbols appear on the second reel, then the win is multiplied by three. Robocop is the wild symbol, but unlike most slots, it substitutes all symbols including the scatter. The fox is the scatter symbol, and three symbols will earn you three free spins, four symbols will grant you four, and so on. Moreover, the win will be multiplied by the number of scatters that triggered the bonus game. Each additional scatter or wild symbol will grant an additional free spin and increase the multiplier by one. The free spin feature can be purchased by paying 50 times the bet, giving access to 3 to 9 free spins, while with a sum of 500 times the bet, 15 free spins can be obtained.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\nCan I play E-Force on my smartphone?\nCertainly! It is a game created with HTML5 architecture, making it accessible on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones.\n\nWhere can I play E-Force?\nYou can play E-Force on any legal online casino with ministerial certification.\n\nWhat are the special symbols in E-Force?\nIn this game, we have the wild symbol, a wild card that replaces all symbols including the scatter. And of course, the scatter symbol that rewards with free spins.\n            ",
