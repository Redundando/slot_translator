Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay mechanics and features\nSpecial symbols and their functions\nMaximum win potential\nMinimum bet and RTP\nDesign and theme\nVolatility level\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Superstars\nWhat happens when the characters and icons from NetEnt's most popular slots come together in one game? This is what the developers had in mind when they designed the 5-reel, 45-fixed-payline slot Superstars. If you want to learn more about the gameplay and special features, stay on this page and read the complete review of Superstars.\n\nGameplay and Betting in Superstars\nYou can start spinning the 5x5 layout of the Superstars slot with 45 paylines right away. The minimum bet you can use per spin is 0.1€, while the highest is 100€. The RTP is 96.08% and the volatility is medium-high. This means that this game will be riskier compared to low volatility slots. \n\nBut the positive side is that, with medium-high volatility, prizes will definitely be less frequent, but also higher, which is a great advantage for those who want more consistent rewards and are not afraid of a more exciting and risky gameplay.\n\nPlot, Design and Symbols\nThe theme of Superstars is a real party where you can find the characters from previous slots released by NetEnt: Gonzo, Finn, the aliens from Space Wars 2 Powerpoints and Lady Pig from Piggy Riches Megaways. This mix makes the crossover truly fantastic.\n\nNot only that, but Superstars also has some elements of dice games, and during the Bonus Game the playing field turns into a board, reminiscent of Monopoly, so it's very fun and creative.\n\nThe symbols in Superstars are also cute: there are 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace, but also Lady Pig, Finn, Brute and Gonzo. There is also another regular symbol: the eight-sided star.\n\nThe main special symbols in the Superstars slot are the Scatter and the Dice, which, besides activating the Bonus Game, can replace Scatter symbols in the main game.\n\nBonus and Extra Features of the Free Superstars Slot\n\nBonus Game - There are 2 ways to activate the Bonus Game: with Scatter symbols or with Dice.\n\nWith Scatter: If 3 or more symbols stop on the reels, they activate the Bonus Game and the Scatter symbols that activated the Bonus Game are transformed into random prizes;\n\nWith Dice: when the Bonus Game is activated, random prizes from 1 to 25x multipliers and dice symbols that give you a free roll by moving a token on the board that hides 7 special features (Finn, Gonzo, Miss Banks, Space Wars, Starburst, Extra Spins and Extra Life) can appear on the reels.\n\nBut the fun and surprises NetEnt doesn't end here... Here are the other benefits you can get during your rounds:\n\nWheel Game\nThe wheel game is activated when the token stops on a square. In this feature, you can spin the wheel and get a series of prizes and extra features, which can be found in the slot's paytable.\n\nReplay Feature\nThe Superstars slot has a special Replay ticket that allows you to replay the Starburst, Gonzo, Miss Banks, Space Wars, Finn or Upgrade features, regardless of whether they were activated from the board or the Wheel.\n\nFinal Game\nWhen all positions on the reels are filled with prizes, the Final Game feature will be activated. Here, prizes will be awarded in all squares: 25x, 50x, 75x, 100x, 500x or 1,000x the bet, except for 2 squares that assign dice symbols when the token stops on them.\n\nBuy Feature\nYou can also activate the Bonus Game feature through the Buy feature option for 150 times your bet.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow can I play Superstar for free?\nVery simple, select one of our highest rated online casinos and look for Superstars in demo mode. Then, you can register, create a new gaming account, and withdraw your no deposit welcome bonus right away.\n\nHow much does it cost to buy bonuses in the Superstars slot?\nThe Buy Bonus costs 150 times your bet; the exact price depends on the amount of the bet.\n\nWhat is the maximum win I can reach in Superstars?\nIf Lady Luck smiles on you and blesses you with good luck, then you can win up to 4,586 times your current bet. In addition, you have a series of features that will make gameplay more fun and greatly increase your chances of winning. You have Bonus Buy, Free Spins, a Wheel Game with prizes, special symbols, multipliers and much more!\n            ",

The game has a minimum betting amount of 0.1€ and a maximum of 100€. The RTP of the Superstars slot is 96.08%, and the volatility is medium-high. This makes it a riskier slot game than low volatility slots, but with higher prizes, making it more appealing to those interested in a riskier gameplay.\n\nPlot, Design and Symbols\n\nSuperstars has a party theme, and the game design is a mix of elements from previous slots released by NetEnt and dice games. The gameplay elements in the game include a board, which players need to traverse in the Bonus Game phase. The symbols in the game are a mixture of alphabet characters and popular character symbols from other slot games, such as Finn, Gonzo, and Lady Pig from Piggy Riches Megaways. Additionally, there is an eight-sided star, which serves as another regular symbol.\n\nSpecial Symbols and their Functions\n\nThe Superstars slot game has two main special symbols: the Scatter and the Dice. The Scatter symbol activates the Bonus Game when three or more appear on the reels. The Dice symbol activates the Bonus Game and offers multiplier bonuses of between one and 25x or free rolls. During the wheel game, level-up features, free spins, and multipliers can be obtained. The game also has a Replay feature, which allows players to replay selected bonus rounds even when they were not triggered by the board or the wheel. Finally, there's also a Final Game, where players can win bigger prizes.\n\nMaximum Win Potential\n\nThe maximum win potential in Superstars is 4,586 times the current bet. This high potential for winnings is due to the game's medium-high volatility, which makes it riskier but offers higher payouts.\n\nMinimum Bet and RTP\n\nThe minimum bet in Superstars is 0.1€ and the RTP is 96.08%. These values make the Superstars slot more appealing to players who are looking for a good payout rate and a lower minimum bet amount.\n\nDesign and Theme\n\nSuperstars has a colorful, party-style design with elements of previous NetEnt slot games. The game has a great mix of different characters, making it appealing to players who enjoy a variety of themes. The colorful design, combined with the energetic music, creates a festive feel throughout the game.\n\nVolatility Level\n\nThe volatility level of the Superstars slot game is medium-high, which means that while prizes are less frequent, they are often higher in value. The game is for players interested in taking risks and who want more consistent rewards.\n\n        \n            ",

This is what the developers had in mind when they designed the 5-reel, 45-fixed-payline slot Superstars. If you want to learn more about the gameplay and special features, stay on this page and read the complete review of Superstars.\n\nGameplay and Betting in Superstars\nYou can start spinning the 5x5 layout of the Superstars slot with 45 paylines right away. The minimum bet you can use per spin is 0.1€, while the highest is 100€. The RTP is 96.08% and the volatility is medium-high. This means that this game will be riskier compared to low volatility slots. \n\nBut the positive side is that, with medium-high volatility, prizes will definitely be less frequent, but also higher, which is a great advantage for those who want more consistent rewards and are not afraid of a more exciting and risky gameplay.\n\nPlot, Design and Symbols\nThe theme of Superstars is a real party where you can find the characters from previous slots released by NetEnt: Gonzo, Finn, the aliens from Space Wars 2 Powerpoints and Lady Pig from Piggy Riches Megaways. This mix makes the crossover truly fantastic.\n\nNot only that, but Superstars also has some elements of dice games, and during the Bonus Game the playing field turns into a board, reminiscent of Monopoly, so it's very fun and creative.\n\nThe symbols in Superstars are also cute: there are 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace, but also Lady Pig, Finn, Brute and Gonzo. There is also another regular symbol: the eight-sided star.\n\nThe main special symbols in the Superstars slot are the Scatter and the Dice, which, besides activating the Bonus Game, can replace Scatter symbols in the main game.\n\nBonus and Extra Features of the Free Superstars Slot\n\nBonus Game - There are 2 ways to activate the Bonus Game: with Scatter symbols or with Dice.\n\nWith Scatter: If 3 or more symbols stop on the reels, they activate the Bonus Game and the Scatter symbols that activated the Bonus Game are transformed into random prizes;\n\nWith Dice: when the Bonus Game is activated, random prizes from 1 to 25x multipliers and dice symbols that give you a free roll by moving a token on the board that hides 7 special features (Finn, Gonzo, Miss Banks, Space Wars, Starburst, Extra Spins and Extra Life) can appear on the reels.\n\nBut the fun and surprises NetEnt doesn't end here... Here are the other benefits you can get during your rounds:\n\nWheel Game\nThe wheel game is activated when the token stops on a square. In this feature, you can spin the wheel and get a series of prizes and extra features, which can be found in the slot's paytable.\n\nReplay Feature\nThe Superstars slot has a special Replay ticket that allows you to replay the Starburst, Gonzo, Miss Banks, Space Wars, Finn or Upgrade features, regardless of whether they were activated from the board or the Wheel.\n\nFinal Game\nWhen all positions on the reels are filled with prizes, the Final Game feature will be activated. Here, prizes will be awarded in all squares: 25x, 50x, 75x, 100x, 500x or 1,000x the bet, except for 2 squares that assign dice symbols when the token stops on them.\n\nBuy Feature\nYou can also activate the Bonus Game feature through the Buy feature option for 150 times your bet.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow can I play Superstar for free?\nVery simple, select one of our highest rated online casinos and look for Superstars in demo mode. Then, you can register, create a new gaming account, and withdraw your no deposit welcome bonus right away.\n\nHow much does it cost to buy bonuses in the Superstars slot?\nThe Buy Bonus costs 150 times your bet; the exact price depends on the amount of the bet.\n\nWhat is the maximum win I can reach in Superstars?\nIf Lady Luck smiles on you and blesses you with good luck, then you can win up to 4,586 times your current bet. In addition, you have a series of features that will make gameplay more fun and greatly increase your chances of winning. You have Bonus Buy, Free Spins, a Wheel Game with prizes, special symbols, multipliers and much more!\n            ",

This is what the developers had in mind when they designed the 5-reel, 45-fixed-payline slot Superstars. If you want to learn more about the gameplay and special features, stay on this page and read the complete review of Superstars.\n\nGameplay and Betting in Superstars\nYou can start spinning the 5x5 layout of the Superstars slot with 45 paylines right away. The minimum bet you can use per spin is 0.1€, while the highest is 100€. The RTP is 96.08% and the volatility is medium-high. This means that this game will be riskier compared to low volatility slots. \n\nBut the positive side is that, with medium-high volatility, prizes will definitely be less frequent, but also higher, which is a great advantage for those who want more consistent rewards and are not afraid of a more exciting and risky gameplay.\n\nPlot, Design and Symbols\nThe theme of Superstars is a real party where you can find the characters from previous slots released by NetEnt: Gonzo, Finn, the aliens from Space Wars 2 Powerpoints and Lady Pig from Piggy Riches Megaways. This mix makes the crossover truly fantastic.\n\nNot only that, but Superstars also has some elements of dice games, and during the Bonus Game the playing field turns into a board, reminiscent of Monopoly, so it's very fun and creative.\n\nThe symbols in Superstars are also cute: there are 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace, but also Lady Pig, Finn, Brute and Gonzo. There is also another regular symbol: the eight-sided star.\n\nThe main special symbols in the Superstars slot are the Scatter and the Dice, which, besides activating the Bonus Game, can replace Scatter symbols in the main game.\n\nBonus and Extra Features of the Free Superstars Slot\n\nBonus Game - There are 2 ways to activate the Bonus Game: with Scatter symbols or with Dice.\n\nWith Scatter: If 3 or more symbols stop on the reels, they activate the Bonus Game and the Scatter symbols that activated the Bonus Game are transformed into random prizes;\n\nWith Dice: when the Bonus Game is activated, random prizes from 1 to 25x multipliers and dice symbols that give you a free roll by moving a token on the board that hides 7 special features (Finn, Gonzo, Miss Banks, Space Wars, Starburst, Extra Spins and Extra Life) can appear on the reels.\n\nBut the fun and surprises NetEnt doesn't end here... Here are the other benefits you can get during your rounds:\n\nWheel Game\nThe wheel game is activated when the token stops on a square. In this feature, you can spin the wheel and get a series of prizes and extra features, which can be found in the slot's paytable.\n\nReplay Feature\nThe Superstars slot has a special Replay ticket that allows you to replay the Starburst, Gonzo, Miss Banks, Space Wars, Finn or Upgrade features, regardless of whether they were activated from the board or the Wheel.\n\nFinal Game\nWhen all positions on the reels are filled with prizes, the Final Game feature will be activated. Here, prizes will be awarded in all squares: 25x, 50x, 75x, 100x, 500x or 1,000x the bet, except for 2 squares that assign dice symbols when the token stops on them.\n\nBuy Feature\nYou can also activate the Bonus Game feature through the Buy feature option for 150 times your bet.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow can I play Superstar for free?\nVery simple, select one of our highest rated online casinos and look for Superstars in demo mode. Then, you can register, create a new gaming account, and withdraw your no deposit welcome bonus right away.\n\nHow much does it cost to buy bonuses in the Superstars slot?\nThe Buy Bonus costs 150 times your bet; the exact price depends on the amount of the bet.\n\nWhat is the maximum win I can reach in Superstars?\nIf Lady Luck smiles on you and blesses you with good luck, then you can win up to 4,586 times your current bet. In addition, you have a series of features that will make gameplay more fun and greatly increase your chances of winning. You have Bonus Buy, Free Spins, a Wheel Game with prizes, special symbols, multipliers and much more!\n            ",
