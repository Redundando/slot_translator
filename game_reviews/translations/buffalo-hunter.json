I pagamenti tendono a crescere vertiginosamente e non è difficile capire perché, una volta scoperto che i giri gratuiti possono portare grandi moltiplicatori. Il premio più grande che il gioco dovrebbe pagare vale 12.647 volte la puntata di quel round.

However, the excellent implementation and added features make all the difference. This game has several exceptional features and is highly volatile, but it ensures that you get what you expect from a game of this kind. \n\nSlot structure of Buffalo Hunter with no registration\nThis free or real money slot game is played on 5x4 reels, with a total of 40 active paylines. There is a jackpot on the line, up to 12,647 times the bet, and an RTP of 96.01%. It features several variations of free spins, a bonus game, mystery symbols, wilds, and scatters. As for betting options, the betting range in the Buffalo Hunter video slot starts at €0.20, the minimum to have all paylines active and spin the reels. From there, the bet can be increased up to €100.00 per spin. Payments tend to increase rapidly, and it's easy to see why, once you discover that free spins can bring big multipliers. The biggest prize the game should pay is worth 12,647 times the bet of that round. The downside of this game is that Buffalo Hunter tends to pay out less often and is highly volatile. This element makes it riskier to play and places it in a special category of games that are typically chosen by experienced players.\n\nKey features of the Buffalo Hunter Slot\n\nOne of the symbols in play, the Dream Catcher, is the slot's wild symbol. It forms combinations and pays up to 50 times the bet alone, but you'll usually use it as a substitute in some lower-value combos. \n\nMystery symbols are also added, which will transform into regular symbols, a single type chosen for all the positions occupied by these icons. \n\nWith scatter symbols in view, landing 3 to 5 times, the game will activate one of the three types of free spins. It's essential to count how many scatters are on the reels, as regular free spins (8 or 10 rounds of Buffalo Horde or Prairie Multiplier) are activated when you get 3 or 4, while the presence of 5 scatters will get you the Super Bonus Stampede.\n\nWhat are the 3 types of Free Spins in Buffalo Horde?\n\nBuffalo Horde: collect certain symbols so that they can be turned into high-value buffalo icons once the counter is full.\nPrairie Multiplier: greater volatility here, but also better potential, as filling up animal counters results in increased multipliers. They can increase up to 5 times winnings using certain symbols.\nStampede Super Bonus: requires 5 scatters to activate and offers free spins where both animal transformations and multipliers are available.\n\nThe game offers you the chance to pay from 100 to 600 times the bet to have access to free spins in one of the versions available inside. \n\nTheme and Design of Buffalo Hunter\nThe theme of the game features the landscape of the classic North American prairie, with wild animals including wolves, cougars, eagles, and of course, buffaloes. It's not a new theme, but the design is excellent. They also maintained the Native American influence on the design, which is mainly seen in the surrounding graphics, as well as in the Dream Catcher Wild.\n\nConclusion\nBuffalo Hunter seems like a very interesting game to play, but the extreme volatility claimed by Nolimit City might keep many players away. If you try it, you'll find a slot machine with interesting features and good potential, even though you'll need to reach free spins to take full advantage of it. With a maximum jackpot of 12,647x, there's a lot to play for. Add in the three different free spins options of the slot, and you'll understand that Buffalo Hunter is a truly competitive slot. Although the high volatility level will bring some drought periods, when you get into the rhythm, then your bankroll will start singing!\n\nFAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about the Buffalo Hunter Slot Machine \nWhat are the key features of the Buffalo Hunter slot?\n\nQuality from developer Nolimit City, RTP of 96.01%, layout 5x40, betting range 0.20 - 100 euros, and maximum payout of 12,647x.\n\nWhere can I play the Buffalo Hunter slot without downloading it?\n\nThe Slotjava team evaluates the best online casinos with Nolimit City games for players.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nBuffalo Hunter slot game features\nGameplay and mechanics\nTheme and design\nVolatility and RTP\nJackpot and payouts\nBetting options\nMobile compatibility\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Buffalo Hunter\nReleased by Nolimit City, the Buffalo Hunter slot game might not impress you at first glance, especially if the North American prairie theme doesn't appeal to you. However, the excellent implementation and added features make all the difference. This game has several exceptional features and is highly volatile, but it ensures that you get what you expect from a game of this kind. \n\nSlot structure of Buffalo Hunter with no registration\nThis free or real money slot game is played on 5x4 reels, with a total of 40 active paylines. There is a jackpot on the line, up to 12,647 times the bet, and an RTP of 96.01%. It features several variations of free spins, a bonus game, mystery symbols, wilds, and scatters. As for betting options, the betting range in the Buffalo Hunter video slot starts at €0.20, the minimum to have all paylines active and spin the reels. From there, the bet can be increased up to €100.00 per spin. Payments tend to increase rapidly, and it's easy to see why, once you discover that free spins can bring big multipliers. The biggest prize the game should pay is worth 12,647 times the bet of that round. The downside of this game is that Buffalo Hunter tends to pay out less often and is highly volatile. This element makes it riskier to play and places it in a special category of games that are typically chosen by experienced players.\n\nKey features of the Buffalo Hunter Slot\n\nOne of the symbols in play, the Dream Catcher, is the slot's wild symbol. It forms combinations and pays up to 50 times the bet alone, but you'll usually use it as a substitute in some lower-value combos. \n\nMystery symbols are also added, which will transform into regular symbols, a single type chosen for all the positions occupied by these icons. \n\nWith scatter symbols in view, landing 3 to 5 times, the game will activate one of the three types of free spins. It's essential to count how many scatters are on the reels, as regular free spins (8 or 10 rounds of Buffalo Horde or Prairie Multiplier) are activated when you get 3 or 4, while the presence of 5 scatters will get you the Super Bonus Stampede.\n\nWhat are the 3 types of Free Spins in Buffalo Horde?\n\nBuffalo Horde: collect certain symbols so that they can be turned into high-value buffalo icons once the counter is full.\nPrairie Multiplier: greater volatility here, but also better potential, as filling up animal counters results in increased multipliers. They can increase up to 5 times winnings using certain symbols.\nStampede Super Bonus: requires 5 scatters to activate and offers free spins where both animal transformations and multipliers are available.\n\nThe game offers you the chance to pay from 100 to 600 times the bet to have access to free spins in one of the versions available inside. \n\nTheme and Design of Buffalo Hunter\nThe theme of the game features the landscape of the classic North American prairie, with wild animals including wolves, cougars, eagles, and of course, buffaloes. It's not a new theme, but the design is excellent. They also maintained the Native American influence on the design, which is mainly seen in the surrounding graphics, as well as in the Dream Catcher Wild.\n\nConclusion\nBuffalo Hunter seems like a very interesting game to play, but the extreme volatility claimed by Nolimit City might keep many players away. If you try it, you'll find a slot machine with interesting features and good potential, even though you'll need to reach free spins to take full advantage of it. With a maximum jackpot of 12,647x, there's a lot to play for. Add in the three different free spins options of the slot, and you'll understand that Buffalo Hunter is a truly competitive slot. Although the high volatility level will bring some drought periods, when you get into the rhythm, then your bankroll will start singing!\n\nFAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about the Buffalo Hunter Slot Machine \nWhat are the key features of the Buffalo Hunter slot?\n\nQuality from developer Nolimit City, RTP of 96.01%, layout 5x40, betting range 0.20 - 100 euros, and maximum payout of 12,647x.\n\nWhere can I play the Buffalo Hunter slot without downloading it?\n\nThe Slotjava team evaluates the best online casinos with Nolimit City games for players.

The Stampede Super Bonus requires 5 scatters to activate and offers free spins where both animal transformations and multipliers are available. The game also offers mystery symbols that can transform into regular symbols and a Dream Catcher wild symbol that pays up to 50 times the bet.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe Buffalo Hunter theme features the North American prairie landscape and wild animals such as wolves, cougars, eagles, and buffaloes. The Dream Catcher is the slot's wild symbol, and there are also mystery symbols that can transform into regular symbols.\n\nBetting Options\n\nThe betting range in the Buffalo Hunter video slot starts at €0.20, the minimum to have all paylines active and spin the reels.

The game offers a jackpot on the line of up to 12,647 times the bet and an RTP of 96.01%. It features variations of free spins, a bonus game, mystery symbols, wilds, and scatters. The betting range starts at €0.20, the minimum to have all paylines in active mode and spin the reels. From there, the bet can be increased up to €100.00 per spin. The biggest prize is worth 12,647 times the bet of that round, and it is paid out less often with high volatility. This game is riskier to play and typically chosen by experienced gamblers.\n\nKey features of the Buffalo Hunter Slot\n\nOne of the symbols in play, the Dream Catcher, is the game's wild. A single Dream Catcher can pay up to 50 times the bet and form lower-value combos. Mystery symbols are also added, transforming into regular symbols when they land. Payouts increase with the presence of a higher number of scatters that activate one of the three types of free spins. Buffalo Horde requires the collection and transformation of specific symbols, Prairie Multiplier includes multipliers that can reach up to five times using certain symbols, and Stampede Super Bonus offers animal transformations and multipliers. Paying from 100 to 600 times the bet will access free spins in one of the versions available.\n\nTheme and Design of Buffalo Hunter\n\nThe game's theme features the classic North American prairie landscape with wild animals such as wolves, cougars, eagles, and buffaloes. The design, while not a new theme, is excellent and maintained the Native American influence that is especially evident in the Dream Catcher Wild and surrounding graphics.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nWith an RTP of 96.01%, it is a highly volatile game. While payments tend to increase rapidly, it pays out less often than other slots, putting it in a special category typically chosen by experienced players.\n\nJackpot and Payouts\n\nThe game offers a maximum jackpot of 12,647 times the bet and high volatility, which means payouts are less frequent. To receive the biggest prize, a player needs to be patient and keep betting on the game.\n\nBetting options of Buffalo Hunter\n\nBuffalo Hunter has a betting range that starts at €0.20 for a single spin when all paylines are in active mode. As the level of experience grows, bets can be adjusted to a maximum of €100. National and international currencies are accepted.\n\nMobile compatibility\n\nBuffalo Hunter is mobile-friendly and can be played on mobile devices without technical or visual limitations. The game is compatible with iOS and Android operating systems and can be accessed from a smartphone or tablet. The game's design and features remain the same on a mobile device as they are on desktop.\n\n        \n            ",

However, the excellent implementation and added features make all the difference. This game has several exceptional features and is highly volatile, but it ensures that you get what you expect from a game of this kind. \n\nSlot structure of Buffalo Hunter with no registration\nThis free or real money slot game is played on 5x4 reels, with a total of 40 active paylines. There is a jackpot on the line, up to 12,647 times the bet, and an RTP of 96.01%. It features several variations of free spins, a bonus game, mystery symbols, wilds, and scatters. As for betting options, the betting range in the Buffalo Hunter video slot starts at €0.20, the minimum to have all paylines active and spin the reels. From there, the bet can be increased up to €100.00 per spin. Payments tend to increase rapidly, and it's easy to see why, once you discover that free spins can bring big multipliers. The biggest prize the game should pay is worth 12,647 times the bet of that round. The downside of this game is that Buffalo Hunter tends to pay out less often and is highly volatile. This element makes it riskier to play and places it in a special category of games that are typically chosen by experienced players.\n\nKey features of the Buffalo Hunter Slot\n\nOne of the symbols in play, the Dream Catcher, is the slot's wild symbol. It forms combinations and pays up to 50 times the bet alone, but you'll usually use it as a substitute in some lower-value combos. \n\nMystery symbols are also added, which will transform into regular symbols, a single type chosen for all the positions occupied by these icons. \n\nWith scatter symbols in view, landing 3 to 5 times, the game will activate one of the three types of free spins. It's essential to count how many scatters are on the reels, as regular free spins (8 or 10 rounds of Buffalo Horde or Prairie Multiplier) are activated when you get 3 or 4, while the presence of 5 scatters will get you the Super Bonus Stampede.\n\nWhat are the 3 types of Free Spins in Buffalo Horde?\n\nBuffalo Horde: collect certain symbols so that they can be turned into high-value buffalo icons once the counter is full.\nPrairie Multiplier: greater volatility here, but also better potential, as filling up animal counters results in increased multipliers. They can increase up to 5 times winnings using certain symbols.\nStampede Super Bonus: requires 5 scatters to activate and offers free spins where both animal transformations and multipliers are available.\n\nThe game offers you the chance to pay from 100 to 600 times the bet to have access to free spins in one of the versions available inside. \n\nTheme and Design of Buffalo Hunter\nThe theme of the game features the landscape of the classic North American prairie, with wild animals including wolves, cougars, eagles, and of course, buffaloes. It's not a new theme, but the design is excellent. They also maintained the Native American influence on the design, which is mainly seen in the surrounding graphics, as well as in the Dream Catcher Wild.\n\nConclusion\nBuffalo Hunter seems like a very interesting game to play, but the extreme volatility claimed by Nolimit City might keep many players away. If you try it, you'll find a slot machine with interesting features and good potential, even though you'll need to reach free spins to take full advantage of it. With a maximum jackpot of 12,647x, there's a lot to play for. Add in the three different free spins options of the slot, and you'll understand that Buffalo Hunter is a truly competitive slot. Although the high volatility level will bring some drought periods, when you get into the rhythm, then your bankroll will start singing!\n\nFAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about the Buffalo Hunter Slot Machine \nWhat are the key features of the Buffalo Hunter slot?\n\nQuality from developer Nolimit City, RTP of 96.01%, layout 5x40, betting range 0.20 - 100 euros, and maximum payout of 12,647x.\n\nWhere can I play the Buffalo Hunter slot without downloading it?\n\nThe Slotjava team evaluates the best online casinos with Nolimit City games for players.

The image should incorporate the North American prairie landscape with wild animals, such as buffaloes, wolves, cougars, and eagles. The warrior should be standing in front of a dream catcher with the game's logo prominently displayed. The overall design should be eye-catching and give players a sense of the game's theme and features."
