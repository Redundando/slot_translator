Il moltiplicatore inizia a x2, passando da x3, x5, fino ad arrivare a x10 se si continua a vincere. Non c’è limite al numero di respins che si accumulano finché i vincitori consecutivi continuano ad essere colpiti.\nIl gioco di slot Hyper Burst è piuttosto semplice. Si concentra esclusivamente sulle vittorie consecutive con respins che aumentano le dimensioni del colossale mulinello di lava. La chiave è di ottenere una bobina di lava colossale 4×4 che poi porta i moltiplicatori fino a 10x in gioco. È da qui che arriveranno senza dubbio le grandi vittorie.\nDa media ad alta varianza, il potenziale moltiplicatore 10x nella funzione Hyper Mode può portare a vincite impressionanti di 12.800x le tue puntate per ogni respin. Tutto ciò che serve è un po’ di fortuna per ottenere abbastanza vittorie successive.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nSe volete un’azione esplosiva, i giochi con i vulcani includono Play ‘n GO’s Gold Volcano che ha un sacco di caratteristiche bonus e vittorie di 5.000x le tue puntate per spin. L’altra alternativa è la slot di Playtech Jackpot Giant che è un titolo di jackpot progressivo e offre jackpot mediamente di 4,5 milioni di euro.\nAlimentata da Play ‘n GO, la slot Gold Volcano è un gioco a 8 rulli a forma di vulcano con vincita a grappolo. Con un tema vulcanico, si può giocare  a giro su tutti i dispositivi. Offre caratteristiche casuali nel gioco di base che possono darvi degli shuffles di simboli, un cambiamento di layout per più modi di vincere, aggiunta di wilds e moltiplicatori wild.\n\n        ",

This 6-reel, 25-payline game features an ancient volcano exploding with riches, and gives you a breath of fresh air with every win as the reels expand. Subsequent respins enlarge the colossal reel up to 3x3 and 4x4 in size. Once the latter is reached, the win multiplier increases up to 10x. With an RTP of 96.02%, it provides wins of up to 12,800x your stake on every spin. Discover more in our review of Hyper Burst.\n\nThe latent power of volcanoes drives the action in Yggdrasil Gaming's Hyper Burst slot game. With its aerodynamic features, Hyper Burst can still draw in all sorts of modifiers when the respins do their job. The result is a game that plays much like the volcano it represents. This means that Hyper Burst can stay dormant for most of the time, but every now and then it explodes in an impressive way.\n\nExplosive graphics\nThe Hyper Burst slot takes you to a tropical island where an erupting volcano is the main attraction. With a Tiki theme, it has a prehistoric graphic look. Located high up in the mountains above the clouds, the lava-filled volcano is behind the reels.\n\nWith an enchanting and mysterious feel, the soundtrack is haunting and adds atmosphere. Among the symbols are the low-value royals A, K, Q, and J, as well as 4 Tiki masks. The red Tiki mask symbol is the most rewarding, giving you 1, 2, 4, or 8x your stake for 3, 4, 5, or 6 in combination.\n\nYou also have a golden wild that substitutes for all symbols. Even more importantly, 3, 4, 5, or 6 wilds will pay out 4, 8, 20, or 100x your total bet.\n\nThe 6x4 reel grid works excellently on mobile and tablet devices as well as on desktop devices like laptops and PCs. The mobile version of the Hyper Burst slot works well on any device you choose.\n\nHyper Burst can be played on any device with bets from 10 cents to €100 per spin available. The action takes place on a game grid consisting of 6 reels, 4 rows, and 25 paylines, producing an RTP rate of 96.02%. The modest number of paylines is not super effective at pulling in wins for most of the time - until giant symbols are created through the features.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nWins are quite regular in theory, officially better than 1 spin in 5 due to a hit frequency of 22.3%. However, it may not seem that way most of the time. The rounding of the mathematical model is medium/high volatility, so don't expect to go all the way with Hyper Respins too often.\n\nAlthough there may technically only be one overall feature - Hyper Respins, several extras are scattered about to enhance the experience. Every win triggers the Respin mode, which comes with additional bonuses. The first Respin combines 2 of the four middle reels to form a colossal 2x2 lava reel. Every consecutive win in Respin mode triggers another respin and grows the lava reel in size. The next increment expands the colossal lava reel to 3x3, and finally to 4x4 size, which is known as the Giga reel - no relation to Giga Blox.\n\nWhen the 4x4 reel is active, the game switches from Respin mode to Hyper mode. Here, wins continue to trigger respins, but a win multiplier also comes into play. The multiplier starts at x2, then goes on to x3, x5, and eventually reaches x10 if you keep winning. There is no limit to the number of respins that accumulate as long as consecutive winners continue to be hit.\n\nThe Hyper Burst slot game is quite straightforward. It focuses solely on consecutive wins with respins that increase the size of the colossal lava reel. The key is to get a 4x4 colossal lava reel, which then brings the multipliers up to 10x in play. That's where the big wins will undoubtedly come from.\n\nFrom medium to high variance, the potential 10x multiplier in Hyper mode can lead to impressive wins of 12,800x your bets per respin. All it takes is a bit of luck to get enough consecutive wins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you want explosive action, volcano-themed games include Play 'n GO's Gold Volcano, which has plenty of bonus features and wins of up to 5,000x your bets per spin. The other alternative is Playtech's Jackpot Giant slot, which is a progressive jackpot title and offers jackpots averaging 4.5 million euros.\n\nPowered by Play 'n GO, the Gold Volcano slot is an 8-reel volcano-shaped cluster win game. With a volcanic theme, you can spin it on all devices. It offers random features in the base game that can give you symbol shuffles, a layout change for more ways to win, adding wilds, and wild multipliers."

The mobile version of the Hyper Burst slot works well on any device you choose.\n\nHyper Burst can be played on any device with bets from 10 cents to €100 per spin available. The action takes place on a game grid consisting of 6 reels, 4 rows, and 25 paylines, producing an RTP rate of 96.02%. The modest number of paylines is not super effective at pulling in wins for most of the time - until giant symbols are created through the features.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nWins are quite regular in theory, officially better than 1 spin in 5 due to a hit frequency of 22.3%. However, it may not seem that way most of the time. The rounding of the mathematical model is medium/high volatility, so don't expect to go all the way with Hyper Respins too often.\n\nAlthough there may technically only be one overall feature - Hyper Respins, several extras are scattered about to enhance the experience. Every win triggers the Respin mode, which comes with additional bonuses. The first Respin combines 2 of the four middle reels to form a colossal 2x2 lava reel. Every consecutive win in Respin mode triggers another respin and grows the lava reel in size. The next increment expands the colossal lava reel to 3x3, and finally to 4x4 size, which is known as the Giga reel - no relation to Giga Blox.\n\nWhen the 4x4 reel is active, the game switches from Respin mode to Hyper mode. Here, wins continue to trigger respins, but a win multiplier also comes into play. The multiplier starts at x2, then goes on to x3, x5, and eventually reaches x10 if you keep winning. There is no limit to the number of respins that accumulate as long as consecutive winners continue to be hit.\n\nThe Hyper Burst slot game is quite straightforward. It focuses solely on consecutive wins with respins that increase the size of the colossal lava reel. The key is to get a 4x4 colossal lava reel, which then brings the multipliers up to 10x in play. That's where the big wins will undoubtedly come from.\n\nFrom medium to high variance, the potential 10x multiplier in Hyper mode can lead to impressive wins of 12,800x your bets per respin. All it takes is a bit of luck to get enough consecutive wins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you want explosive action, volcano-themed games include Play 'n GO's Gold Volcano, which has plenty of bonus features and wins of up to 5,000x your bets per spin. The other alternative is Playtech's Jackpot Giant slot, which is a progressive jackpot title and offers jackpots averaging 4.5 million euros.\n\nPowered by Play 'n GO, the Gold Volcano slot is an 8-reel volcano-shaped cluster win game. With a volcanic theme, you can spin it on all devices. It offers random features in the base game that can give you symbol shuffles, a layout change for more ways to win, adding wilds, and wild multipliers.\n            ",

With an RTP of 96.02%, it provides wins of up to 12,800x your stake on every spin.

The game revolves around consecutive wins with respins that make the lava reel swell to colossal proportions. Every time you win, you trigger Respin mode, which comes with exciting bonuses that will have you erupting with joy.</p><p>After your first Respin, watch 2 of the middle reels combine to form a massive 2x2 lava reel.

The Tiki theme with an erupting volcano in the background gives the game an adventurous look. The game offers an RTP of 96.02%, and bets range from 10 cents to €100 per spin. The mobile version of the game functions well on any device.\n\nJackpot and Payouts\n\nWith an RTP of 96.02%, this slot game provides the potential for wins of up to 12,800x your stake on each spin. While wins may not be very frequent, the possibility of huge payouts brings about an exciting element for players to look forward to.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nThe game's main feature is the Respin mode, where every win triggers a new respin and the size of the colossal lava reel increases. The colossal reel can expand up to 4x4 in size and comes with a progressive win multiplier of up to 10x through the Hyper mode. The game has no limit on the number of respins that can accumulate, as long as consecutive wins continue.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nThe graphics of Hyper Burst are top-notch, with an attractive Tiki theme and an erupting volcano in the background. The game has a prehistoric look, and the haunting soundtrack adds suspenseful atmosphere to the game. The game works equally excellently on mobile and desktop devices without losing any of its visual or sound appeal.\n\nTheme and Symbols\n\nThe Tiki theme of the game is brilliantly executed, with low-value royal symbols and a range of Tiki masks that offer varying rewards. The red mask symbol is the most rewarding, offering up to 8x your stake for six in combination. A golden wild substitutes for all symbols, making it easier to hit those consecutive wins and trigger the Respin mode.\n\nMobile Compatibility\n\nHyper Burst is compatible with all mobile devices and desktops, providing the same high-quality graphics and sound on all platforms. The mobile version of the game works seamlessly on any device, providing players the opportunity to play from anywhere at any time.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nHyper Burst is a medium to high variance slot game with an RTP of 96.02%. Although the paylines are not particularly effective at bringing in wins for most of the time, the progressive nature of the Respin mode and the possibility of gigantic multipliers can lead to massive payouts of up to 12,800x your stake per respin.\n\n        \n            ",

The game focuses on consecutive wins with respins that increase the size of the colossal lava reel. Every win triggers the Respin mode, which comes with additional bonuses. The first Respin combines 2 of the four middle reels to form a colossal 2x2 lava reel. Every consecutive win in Respin mode triggers another respin and grows the lava reel in size. The next increment expands the colossal lava reel to 3x3, and finally to 4x4 size, which is known as the Giga reel. The game switches from Respin mode to Hyper mode when the 4x4 reel is active. Wins continue to trigger respins, but a win multiplier also comes into play. The multiplier starts at x2, goes on to x3, x5, and finally reaches x10 if you keep winning. \n\nGraphics and Visuals\n\nHyper Burst has a Tiki theme with a prehistoric graphic look. The stunning graphics take you on a journey to a tropical island where an erupting volcano is the main attraction. The lava-filled volcano is behind the 6x4 reel grid, creating an enchanting and mysterious feel. The soundtrack adds to the atmosphere and is haunting. Among the symbols are low-value royals A, K, Q, and J, as well as four Tiki masks. The red Tiki mask symbol is the most rewarding. The game grid works excellently on mobile and tablet devices, as well as on desktop devices like laptops and PCs.\n\nPayouts and Jackpots\n\nHyper Burst has an RTP of 96.02% and provides wins of up to 12,800x your stake on every spin. While wins are quite regular in theory, the rounding of the mathematical model is medium/high volatility. This means that the game can stay dormant for most of the time, but every now and then it explodes in an impressive way. The potential 10x multiplier in Hyper mode can lead to impressive wins of 12,800x your bets per respin.\n\nBonus Features\n\nHyper Burst has only one overall feature - Hyper Respins. However, the game comes with several extras that are scattered about to enhance the experience. Every win triggers the Respin mode, which comes with additional bonuses. The first Respin combines 2 of the four middle reels to form a colossal 2x2 lava reel. Every consecutive win in Respin mode triggers another respin and grows the lava reel in size. When the 4x4 reel is active, the game switches from Respin mode to Hyper mode. Here, wins continue to trigger respins, but a win multiplier also comes into play. The multiplier starts at x2, then goes on to x3, x5, and eventually reaches x10 if you keep winning.\n\nBetting Range and RTP\n\nHyper Burst can be played on any device with bets from 10 cents to €100 per spin available. The action takes place on a game grid consisting of 6 reels, 4 rows, and 25 paylines, producing an RTP rate of 96.02%. The modest number of paylines is not super effective at pulling in wins for most of the time - until giant symbols are created through the features.\n\nMobile Compatibility\n\nHyper Burst works excellently on mobile and tablet devices as well as on desktop devices like laptops and PCs. The mobile version of the game works well on any device you choose.\n\nTheme and Storyline\n\nHyper Burst, by Yggdrasil Gaming, takes you to a tropical island where an ancient volcano explodes with riches. The game has a Tiki theme with a prehistoric graphic look. The lava-filled volcano is the main attraction in the game, creating an enchanting and mysterious feel. With an RTP of 96.02%, this high-volatility slot game provides wins of up to 12,800x your stake on every spin.\n\n        \n            ",

This 6-reel, 25-payline game features an ancient volcano exploding with riches, and gives you a breath of fresh air with every win as the reels expand. Subsequent respins enlarge the colossal reel up to 3x3 and 4x4 in size. Once the latter is reached, the win multiplier increases up to 10x. With an RTP of 96.02%, it provides wins of up to 12,800x your stake on every spin. Discover more in our review of Hyper Burst.\n\nThe latent power of volcanoes drives the action in Yggdrasil Gaming's Hyper Burst slot game. With its aerodynamic features, Hyper Burst can still draw in all sorts of modifiers when the respins do their job. The result is a game that plays much like the volcano it represents. This means that Hyper Burst can stay dormant for most of the time, but every now and then it explodes in an impressive way.\n\nExplosive graphics\nThe Hyper Burst slot takes you to a tropical island where an erupting volcano is the main attraction. With a Tiki theme, it has a prehistoric graphic look. Located high up in the mountains above the clouds, the lava-filled volcano is behind the reels.\n\nWith an enchanting and mysterious feel, the soundtrack is haunting and adds atmosphere. Among the symbols are the low-value royals A, K, Q, and J, as well as 4 Tiki masks. The red Tiki mask symbol is the most rewarding, giving you 1, 2, 4, or 8x your stake for 3, 4, 5, or 6 in combination.\n\nYou also have a golden wild that substitutes for all symbols. Even more importantly, 3, 4, 5, or 6 wilds will pay out 4, 8, 20, or 100x your total bet.\n\nThe 6x4 reel grid works excellently on mobile and tablet devices as well as on desktop devices like laptops and PCs. The mobile version of the Hyper Burst slot works well on any device you choose.\n\nHyper Burst can be played on any device with bets from 10 cents to €100 per spin available. The action takes place on a game grid consisting of 6 reels, 4 rows, and 25 paylines, producing an RTP rate of 96.02%. The modest number of paylines is not super effective at pulling in wins for most of the time - until giant symbols are created through the features.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nWins are quite regular in theory, officially better than 1 spin in 5 due to a hit frequency of 22.3%. However, it may not seem that way most of the time. The rounding of the mathematical model is medium/high volatility, so don't expect to go all the way with Hyper Respins too often.\n\nAlthough there may technically only be one overall feature - Hyper Respins, several extras are scattered about to enhance the experience. Every win triggers the Respin mode, which comes with additional bonuses. The first Respin combines 2 of the four middle reels to form a colossal 2x2 lava reel. Every consecutive win in Respin mode triggers another respin and grows the lava reel in size. The next increment expands the colossal lava reel to 3x3, and finally to 4x4 size, which is known as the Giga reel - no relation to Giga Blox.\n\nWhen the 4x4 reel is active, the game switches from Respin mode to Hyper mode. Here, wins continue to trigger respins, but a win multiplier also comes into play. The multiplier starts at x2, then goes on to x3, x5, and eventually reaches x10 if you keep winning. There is no limit to the number of respins that accumulate as long as consecutive winners continue to be hit.\n\nThe Hyper Burst slot game is quite straightforward. It focuses solely on consecutive wins with respins that increase the size of the colossal lava reel. The key is to get a 4x4 colossal lava reel, which then brings the multipliers up to 10x in play. That's where the big wins will undoubtedly come from.\n\nFrom medium to high variance, the potential 10x multiplier in Hyper mode can lead to impressive wins of 12,800x your bets per respin. All it takes is a bit of luck to get enough consecutive wins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you want explosive action, volcano-themed games include Play 'n GO's Gold Volcano, which has plenty of bonus features and wins of up to 5,000x your bets per spin. The other alternative is Playtech's Jackpot Giant slot, which is a progressive jackpot title and offers jackpots averaging 4.5 million euros.\n\nPowered by Play 'n GO, the Gold Volcano slot is an 8-reel volcano-shaped cluster win game. With a volcanic theme, you can spin it on all devices.

This 6-reel, 25-payline game features an ancient volcano exploding with riches, and gives you a breath of fresh air with every win as the reels expand. Subsequent respins enlarge the colossal reel up to 3x3 and 4x4 in size. Once the latter is reached, the win multiplier increases up to 10x. With an RTP of 96.02%, it provides wins of up to 12,800x your stake on every spin. Discover more in our review of Hyper Burst.\n\nThe latent power of volcanoes drives the action in Yggdrasil Gaming's Hyper Burst slot game. With its aerodynamic features, Hyper Burst can still draw in all sorts of modifiers when the respins do their job. The result is a game that plays much like the volcano it represents. This means that Hyper Burst can stay dormant for most of the time, but every now and then it explodes in an impressive way.\n\nExplosive graphics\nThe Hyper Burst slot takes you to a tropical island where an erupting volcano is the main attraction. With a Tiki theme, it has a prehistoric graphic look. Located high up in the mountains above the clouds, the lava-filled volcano is behind the reels.\n\nWith an enchanting and mysterious feel, the soundtrack is haunting and adds atmosphere. Among the symbols are the low-value royals A, K, Q, and J, as well as 4 Tiki masks. The red Tiki mask symbol is the most rewarding, giving you 1, 2, 4, or 8x your stake for 3, 4, 5, or 6 in combination.\n\nYou also have a golden wild that substitutes for all symbols. Even more importantly, 3, 4, 5, or 6 wilds will pay out 4, 8, 20, or 100x your total bet.\n\nThe 6x4 reel grid works excellently on mobile and tablet devices as well as on desktop devices like laptops and PCs. The mobile version of the Hyper Burst slot works well on any device you choose.\n\nHyper Burst can be played on any device with bets from 10 cents to €100 per spin available. The action takes place on a game grid consisting of 6 reels, 4 rows, and 25 paylines, producing an RTP rate of 96.02%. The modest number of paylines is not super effective at pulling in wins for most of the time - until giant symbols are created through the features.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nWins are quite regular in theory, officially better than 1 spin in 5 due to a hit frequency of 22.3%. However, it may not seem that way most of the time. The rounding of the mathematical model is medium/high volatility, so don't expect to go all the way with Hyper Respins too often.\n\nAlthough there may technically only be one overall feature - Hyper Respins, several extras are scattered about to enhance the experience. Every win triggers the Respin mode, which comes with additional bonuses. The first Respin combines 2 of the four middle reels to form a colossal 2x2 lava reel. Every consecutive win in Respin mode triggers another respin and grows the lava reel in size. The next increment expands the colossal lava reel to 3x3, and finally to 4x4 size, which is known as the Giga reel - no relation to Giga Blox.\n\nWhen the 4x4 reel is active, the game switches from Respin mode to Hyper mode. Here, wins continue to trigger respins, but a win multiplier also comes into play. The multiplier starts at x2, then goes on to x3, x5, and eventually reaches x10 if you keep winning. There is no limit to the number of respins that accumulate as long as consecutive winners continue to be hit.\n\nThe Hyper Burst slot game is quite straightforward. It focuses solely on consecutive wins with respins that increase the size of the colossal lava reel. The key is to get a 4x4 colossal lava reel, which then brings the multipliers up to 10x in play. That's where the big wins will undoubtedly come from.\n\nFrom medium to high variance, the potential 10x multiplier in Hyper mode can lead to impressive wins of 12,800x your bets per respin. All it takes is a bit of luck to get enough consecutive wins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you want explosive action, volcano-themed games include Play 'n GO's Gold Volcano, which has plenty of bonus features and wins of up to 5,000x your bets per spin. The other alternative is Playtech's Jackpot Giant slot, which is a progressive jackpot title and offers jackpots averaging 4.5 million euros.\n\nPowered by Play 'n GO, the Gold Volcano slot is an 8-reel volcano-shaped cluster win game. With a volcanic theme, you can spin it on all devices. It offers random features in the base game that can give you symbol shuffles, a layout change for more ways to win, adding wilds, and wild multipliers.\n            ",
