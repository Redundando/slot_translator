Like its predecessor, the Dazzle Me Megaways slot features well-known gem and fruit symbols to offer you the ultimate gaming experience. With Megaways, you'll play with up to 99,225 ways to win. In addition to avalanche wins, there are Dazzling Wild Reels and Free Spins that can give you up to 20,000 times your winnings.

In addition to avalanche wins, there are Dazzling Wild Reels and Free Spins that can give you up to 20,000 times your winnings. Discover more in our complete review of the Dazzle Me Megaways slot.\n\nA classic yet striking design\nJust like the original game, the Dazzle Me Megaways slot is played using a 6-reel machine. However, the setup is quite different in the sequel, starting with the Megaways mechanic. At each spin, between 2 and 9 symbols can appear on each reel. This alters the number of ways to win for that spin. If all 6 reels reach their maximum height, you'll have 99,225 Megaways active. As usual for a slot that uses a Megaways game engine, winners are created by landing matching symbols on adjacent reels, starting from reel 1.\n\nThe betting levels in Dazzle Me Megaways range from 20 cents to €200 per spin. Click on the coin icon to change the size of your bet accordingly. There is also a Turbo mode and Autoplay feature in some countries (not in the UK from October 2021).\n\nDazzle Megaways RTP is 96.1%, which is average for a Megaways game. The success frequency rate is 23.63%, which means that almost a quarter of spins will result in a winning combination. Volatility is in the middle range, as the biggest wins will come from the free spins. The maximum you can win from a single spin and from a series of avalanches here is 50,000 x your total bet per spin.\n\nYou'll hear a classic fruity-style soundtrack playing in the background as you spin. As usual for a NetEnt slot, the design here is bright and bold, and the soundtrack is lively and optimistic. On the reels, you'll find an assortment of gem symbols alongside classic fruity images such as clovers, bells, and lucky 7s. The lucky 7 is the most lucrative symbol, paying out 3 x your total bet if you get 6 on adjacent reels.\n\nThe diamond is the Wild symbol. This can substitute for all standard symbols when it is part of a winning combination. The wild can also fill entire reels. These Dazzling Wild Reels are in play during the bonus round and can really kick off the action when the free spins are activated.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nAt the heart of the action is the Megaways game engine that will randomly select between 2 and 9 symbols to land on the reels, based on the maximum height for the 5-5-7-7-9-9 format, and thus creates anywhere from 64 to 99,225 ways to win for each spin. Then, there's the rolling reels mechanic with cascading symbols, called the Avalanche function on NetEnt slots. Land three or more symbols on adjacent reels starting from the leftmost one, and you'll have a winner. The symbols in a winning combination will explode to make way for new symbols that will fall into their place. The chain reaction will continue until new winners occur after a cascade, allowing you to potentially win multiple times in a single spin sequence.\n\nThe main objective, however, are still the Diamond Wilds, both in the base game and in the free spins. They only appear during the Dazzling Wild Reels feature, which is randomly triggered in the main game and on every free spin in the bonus round (more on the latter later). The screen darkens, and up to three reels between 2 and 6 become wild for the current spin. Getting a win containing the wild symbols will shatter them along with the other winning symbols before being replaced by regular paying symbols in the following avalanche.\n\nTo activate the Free Spins feature, you'll need to land 4 Free Spins symbols anywhere on the reels in the same spin. Your reward is 8 free spins. You'll receive another 4 free spins in addition to the minimum allocation for each extra Free Spins symbol that hits on the triggering spin. Landing 6 free spins symbols, for example, will give you 16 free spins.\n\nDuring the feature, at least 1 reel will be turned into a Dazzling Wild Reel. The entire reel will be Wild for that free spin and any subsequent cascades that follow.\n\nThen there's the Dazzling Wild Reels feature. The number of wilds that appear on a Dazzling Wild Reel starts at 2. There are opportunities to add to that number though. Every time you get a win that includes a wild, the counter for that reel increases by 1.",

Come al solito per una slot NetEnt, il design qui è luminoso e audace e la colonna sonora è vivace e ottimista.\nSui rulli, troverai un assortimento di simboli di pietre preziose che appaiono accanto ad alcune immagini fruttate classiche tra cui quadrifogli, campane e 7 fortunati. Il 7 fortunato è il simbolo più lucrativo, che paga 3 x la tua puntata totale se ne ottieni 6 sui rulli adiacenti.\nIl diamante è il simbolo Wild. Questo può sostituire tutti i simboli standard quando fa parte di una combinazione vincente. Il wild può anche riempire intere bobine. Questi Dazzling Wild Reels sono in gioco durante il bonus round e possono davvero far partire l’azione quando si attivano i giri gratuiti.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nAl centro dell’azione c’è il motore di gioco Megaways che selezionerà casualmente tra 2 e 9 simboli per atterrare sui rulli, in base all’altezza massima per il formato 5-5-7-7-9-9 e quindi crea ovunque da 64 a 99.225 modi per vincere per ogni giro.\nPoi, c’è la meccanica dei rulli che ruzzolano con simboli a cascata, chiamata funzione Avalanche sulle slot NetEnt. Atterra tre o più simboli sui rulli adiacenti a partire da quello più a sinistra e avrai un vincitore. I simboli di una combinazione vincente esploderanno per fare spazio a nuovi simboli che cadranno al loro posto. La reazione a catena continuerà finché si verificheranno nuovi vincitori dopo una cascata, permettendoti di vincere potenzialmente più volte in una singola sequenza di spin.\nL’obiettivo principale, tuttavia, sono ancora i Diamond Wilds, e questo nel gioco base e nei giri gratuiti. Appaiono solo durante la funzione Dazzling Wild Reels, che si attiva in modo casuale nel gioco principale e su ogni giro gratuito nel bonus round (più avanti per quest’ultimo). Lo schermo si oscura e fino a tre rulli tra il 2 e il 6 diventano wild per il giro corrente. Ottenendo una vincita contenente i simboli selvatici, questi si frantumeranno insieme agli altri simboli vincenti prima di essere sostituiti da simboli di pagamento regolari nella seguente Avalanche.\nPer attivare la funzione Free Spins, dovrai far atterrare 4 simboli Free Spins ovunque sui rulli nello stesso giro. La tua ricompensa è di 8 giri gratis. Riceverai altri 4 giri gratis in aggiunta all’assegnazione minima per ogni simbolo di giri gratis extra che colpisce sul giro che si innesca. L’atterraggio di 6 simboli di giri gratuiti, per esempio, ti darà 16 giri gratuiti.\nDurante la caratteristica, almeno 1 rullo con il trasformato in un Dazzling Wild Reel. L’intero rullo sarà Wild per quel giro gratuito e per qualsiasi valanga successiva che segue.\nPoi hai la funzione Dazzling Wild Reels. Il numero di wilds che appaiono in un Dazzling Wild Reel inizia a 2. Ci sono opportunità di aggiungere a quel numero però. Ogni volta che ottieni una vincita che include un wild, il contatore per quel rullo aumenta di 1.\n\n        ",

Just like the original version, the Dazzle Me Megaways slot features the well-known symbols of gems and fruits to offer you the ultimate gaming experience. Thanks to the Megaways, you can play with up to 99,225 ways to win. In addition to avalanche wins, there are Dazzling Wild Reels and Free Spins to give you up to 20,000 times the prizes at stake.

Discover more in our complete review of the Dazzle Me Megaways slot.\nA traditional but impressive graphics\nJust like the original game, the Dazzle Me Megaways slot is played on a 6-reel machine. The set up is quite different in the sequel, starting with the Megaways mechanic. On each spin, between 2 and 9 symbols may appear on each reel.\nThis alters the number of ways to win for that spin. If all 6 reels reach their maximum height, you will have 99,225 Megaways active. As usual for a slot that uses a Megaways game engine, winners are created by landing matching symbols on adjacent reels, starting from reel 1.\nThe bet levels in Dazzle Me Megaways range from €0.20 to €200 per spin. Click on the coin icon to change the size of your bet accordingly. There is also a Turbo mode and Autoplay feature in some countries (not in the UK from October 2021).\nThe RTP of Dazzle Megaways is 96.1%, which is average for a Megaways game. The success frequency rate is 23.63%, which means that almost a quarter of spins will result in a winning combination.\nThe volatility is in the medium range as the biggest wins will come from the free spins. The maximum you can win from a single spin and from a series of avalanches here is 50,000x your total bet per spin.\nYou will hear a classic fruity-style soundtrack playing in the background as you spin. As usual for a NetEnt slot, the design here is bright and bold and the soundtrack is lively and optimistic.\nOn the reels, you will find an assortment of gemstone symbols that appear alongside some classic fruity images including clovers, bells, and lucky 7s. The lucky 7s are the most lucrative symbol, paying 3x your total bet if you get 6 on adjacent reels.\nThe diamond is the Wild symbol. This can replace all standard symbols when it is part of a winning combination. The Wild can also fill entire reels. These Dazzling Wild Reels are in play during the bonus round and can really kick the action into gear when free spins are triggered.\nSlot Machine Symbols and Features\nAt the center of the action is the Megaways game engine that will randomly pick between 2 and 9 symbols to land on the reels based on the maximum height for the 5-5-7-7-9-9 format and therefore create anywhere from 64 to 99,225 ways to win on every spin.\nThen there is the rolling reel mechanic with cascading symbols, called the Avalanche feature on NetEnt slots. Land three or more symbols on adjacent reels starting from the leftmost one and you will have a winner. The symbols in a winning combination will explode to make way for new symbols that will fall into their place. The chain reaction will continue until no more new winners occur after an avalanche, potentially allowing you to win multiple times in a single sequence of spins.\nHowever, the main aim is still the Diamond Wilds, both in the base game and in the free spins. They only appear during the Dazzling Wild Reels feature, which is randomly triggered in the base game and on every free spin in the bonus round (more on the latter below). The screen darkens and up to three reels between 2 and 6 become wild for the current spin. Getting a win containing the wild symbols will cause them to shatter along with any other winning symbols before being replaced by regular paying symbols in the following Avalanche.\nTo trigger the Free Spins feature, you will need to land 4 Free Spins symbols anywhere on the reels in the same spin. Your reward is 8 free spins. You will receive another 4 free spins in addition to the minimum allocation for each extra Free Spins symbol that hits on the triggering spin. Landing 6 Free Spins symbols, for example, will give you 16 free spins.\nDuring the feature, at least 1 reel with be transformed into a Dazzling Wild Reel. The entire reel will be wild for that free spin and for any subsequent avalanche that follows.\nThen you have the Dazzling Wild Reels feature. The number of wilds that appear on a Dazzling Wild Reel starts at 2. There are opportunities to add to that number though. Each time you get a win that includes a wild, the counter for that reel increases by 1."

Discover more in our complete review of the Dazzle Me Megaways slot.\nA traditional but impressive graphics\nJust like the original game, the Dazzle Me Megaways slot is played on a 6-reel machine. The set up is quite different in the sequel, starting with the Megaways mechanic. On each spin, between 2 and 9 symbols may appear on each reel.\nThis alters the number of ways to win for that spin. If all 6 reels reach their maximum height, you will have 99,225 Megaways active. As usual for a slot that uses a Megaways game engine, winners are created by landing matching symbols on adjacent reels, starting from reel 1.\nThe bet levels in Dazzle Me Megaways range from €0.20 to €200 per spin. Click on the coin icon to change the size of your bet accordingly. There is also a Turbo mode and Autoplay feature in some countries (not in the UK from October 2021).\nThe RTP of Dazzle Megaways is 96.1%, which is average for a Megaways game. The success frequency rate is 23.63%, which means that almost a quarter of spins will result in a winning combination.\nThe volatility is in the medium range as the biggest wins will come from the free spins. The maximum you can win from a single spin and from a series of avalanches here is 50,000x your total bet per spin.\nYou will hear a classic fruity-style soundtrack playing in the background as you spin. As usual for a NetEnt slot, the design here is bright and bold and the soundtrack is lively and optimistic.\nOn the reels, you will find an assortment of gemstone symbols that appear alongside some classic fruity images including clovers, bells, and lucky 7s. The lucky 7s are the most lucrative symbol, paying 3x your total bet if you get 6 on adjacent reels.\nThe diamond is the Wild symbol. This can replace all standard symbols when it is part of a winning combination. The Wild can also fill entire reels. These Dazzling Wild Reels are in play during the bonus round and can really kick the action into gear when free spins are triggered.\nSlot Machine Symbols and Features\nAt the center of the action is the Megaways game engine that will randomly pick between 2 and 9 symbols to land on the reels based on the maximum height for the 5-5-7-7-9-9 format and therefore create anywhere from 64 to 99,225 ways to win on every spin.\nThen there is the rolling reel mechanic with cascading symbols, called the Avalanche feature on NetEnt slots. Land three or more symbols on adjacent reels starting from the leftmost one and you will have a winner. The symbols in a winning combination will explode to make way for new symbols that will fall into their place. The chain reaction will continue until no more new winners occur after an avalanche, potentially allowing you to win multiple times in a single sequence of spins.\nHowever, the main aim is still the Diamond Wilds, both in the base game and in the free spins. They only appear during the Dazzling Wild Reels feature, which is randomly triggered in the base game and on every free spin in the bonus round (more on the latter below). The screen darkens and up to three reels between 2 and 6 become wild for the current spin. Getting a win containing the wild symbols will cause them to shatter along with any other winning symbols before being replaced by regular paying symbols in the following Avalanche.\nTo trigger the Free Spins feature, you will need to land 4 Free Spins symbols anywhere on the reels in the same spin. Your reward is 8 free spins. You will receive another 4 free spins in addition to the minimum allocation for each extra Free Spins symbol that hits on the triggering spin. Landing 6 Free Spins symbols, for example, will give you 16 free spins.\nDuring the feature, at least 1 reel with be transformed into a Dazzling Wild Reel. The entire reel will be wild for that free spin and for any subsequent avalanche that follows.\nThen you have the Dazzling Wild Reels feature. The number of wilds that appear on a Dazzling Wild Reel starts at 2. There are opportunities to add to that number though. Each time you get a win that includes a wild, the counter for that reel increases by 1.\n            ",

Just like the original version, the Dazzle Me Megaways slot features the well-known symbols of gems and fruits to offer you the ultimate gaming experience. Thanks to the Megaways, you can play with up to 99,225 ways to win. In addition to avalanche wins, there are Dazzling Wild Reels and Free Spins to give you up to 20,000 times the prizes at stake.

Discover more in our complete review of the Dazzle Me Megaways slot.\nA traditional but impressive graphics\nJust like the original game, the Dazzle Me Megaways slot is played on a 6-reel machine. The set up is quite different in the sequel, starting with the Megaways mechanic. On each spin, between 2 and 9 symbols may appear on each reel.\nThis alters the number of ways to win for that spin. If all 6 reels reach their maximum height, you will have 99,225 Megaways active. As usual for a slot that uses a Megaways game engine, winners are created by landing matching symbols on adjacent reels, starting from reel 1.\nThe bet levels in Dazzle Me Megaways range from €0.20 to €200 per spin. Click on the coin icon to change the size of your bet accordingly. There is also a Turbo mode and Autoplay feature in some countries (not in the UK from October 2021).\nThe RTP of Dazzle Megaways is 96.1%, which is average for a Megaways game. The success frequency rate is 23.63%, which means that almost a quarter of spins will result in a winning combination.\nThe volatility is in the medium range as the biggest wins will come from the free spins. The maximum you can win from a single spin and from a series of avalanches here is 50,000x your total bet per spin.\nYou will hear a classic fruity-style soundtrack playing in the background as you spin. As usual for a NetEnt slot, the design here is bright and bold and the soundtrack is lively and optimistic.\nOn the reels, you will find an assortment of gemstone symbols that appear alongside some classic fruity images including clovers, bells, and lucky 7s. The lucky 7s are the most lucrative symbol, paying 3x your total bet if you get 6 on adjacent reels.\nThe diamond is the Wild symbol. This can replace all standard symbols when it is part of a winning combination. The Wild can also fill entire reels. These Dazzling Wild Reels are in play during the bonus round and can really kick the action into gear when free spins are triggered.\nSlot Machine Symbols and Features\nAt the center of the action is the Megaways game engine that will randomly pick between 2 and 9 symbols to land on the reels based on the maximum height for the 5-5-7-7-9-9 format and therefore create anywhere from 64 to 99,225 ways to win on every spin.\nThen there is the rolling reel mechanic with cascading symbols, called the Avalanche feature on NetEnt slots. Land three or more symbols on adjacent reels starting from the leftmost one and you will have a winner. The symbols in a winning combination will explode to make way for new symbols that will fall into their place. The chain reaction will continue until no more new winners occur after an avalanche, potentially allowing you to win multiple times in a single sequence of spins.\nHowever, the main aim is still the Diamond Wilds, both in the base game and in the free spins. They only appear during the Dazzling Wild Reels feature, which is randomly triggered in the base game and on every free spin in the bonus round (more on the latter below). The screen darkens and up to three reels between 2 and 6 become wild for the current spin. Getting a win containing the wild symbols will cause them to shatter along with any other winning symbols before being replaced by regular paying symbols in the following Avalanche.\nTo trigger the Free Spins feature, you will need to land 4 Free Spins symbols anywhere on the reels in the same spin. Your reward is 8 free spins. You will receive another 4 free spins in addition to the minimum allocation for each extra Free Spins symbol that hits on the triggering spin. Landing 6 Free Spins symbols, for example, will give you 16 free spins.\nDuring the feature, at least 1 reel with be transformed into a Dazzling Wild Reel. The entire reel will be wild for that free spin and for any subsequent avalanche that follows.\nThen you have the Dazzling Wild Reels feature. The number of wilds that appear on a Dazzling Wild Reel starts at 2. There are opportunities to add to that number though. Each time you get a win that includes a wild, the counter for that reel increases by 1.\n            ",

Just like the original version, the Dazzle Me Megaways slot features the well-known symbols of gems and fruits to offer you the ultimate gaming experience. Thanks to the Megaways, you can play with up to 99,225 ways to win. In addition to avalanche wins, there are Dazzling Wild Reels and Free Spins to give you up to 20,000 times the prizes at stake.

Discover more in our complete review of the Dazzle Me Megaways slot.\nA traditional but impressive graphics\nJust like the original game, the Dazzle Me Megaways slot is played on a 6-reel machine. The set up is quite different in the sequel, starting with the Megaways mechanic. On each spin, between 2 and 9 symbols may appear on each reel.\nThis alters the number of ways to win for that spin. If all 6 reels reach their maximum height, you will have 99,225 Megaways active. As usual for a slot that uses a Megaways game engine, winners are created by landing matching symbols on adjacent reels, starting from reel 1.\nThe bet levels in Dazzle Me Megaways range from €0.20 to €200 per spin. Click on the coin icon to change the size of your bet accordingly. There is also a Turbo mode and Autoplay feature in some countries (not in the UK from October 2021).\nThe RTP of Dazzle Megaways is 96.1%, which is average for a Megaways game. The success frequency rate is 23.63%, which means that almost a quarter of spins will result in a winning combination.\nThe volatility is in the medium range as the biggest wins will come from the free spins. The maximum you can win from a single spin and from a series of avalanches here is 50,000x your total bet per spin.\nYou will hear a classic fruity-style soundtrack playing in the background as you spin. As usual for a NetEnt slot, the design here is bright and bold and the soundtrack is lively and optimistic.\nOn the reels, you will find an assortment of gemstone symbols that appear alongside some classic fruity images including clovers, bells, and lucky 7s. The lucky 7s are the most lucrative symbol, paying 3x your total bet if you get 6 on adjacent reels.\nThe diamond is the Wild symbol. This can replace all standard symbols when it is part of a winning combination. The Wild can also fill entire reels. These Dazzling Wild Reels are in play during the bonus round and can really kick the action into gear when free spins are triggered.\nSlot Machine Symbols and Features\nAt the center of the action is the Megaways game engine that will randomly pick between 2 and 9 symbols to land on the reels based on the maximum height for the 5-5-7-7-9-9 format and therefore create anywhere from 64 to 99,225 ways to win on every spin.\nThen there is the rolling reel mechanic with cascading symbols, called the Avalanche feature on NetEnt slots. Land three or more symbols on adjacent reels starting from the leftmost one and you will have a winner. The symbols in a winning combination will explode to make way for new symbols that will fall into their place. The chain reaction will continue until no more new winners occur after an avalanche, potentially allowing you to win multiple times in a single sequence of spins.\nHowever, the main aim is still the Diamond Wilds, both in the base game and in the free spins. They only appear during the Dazzling Wild Reels feature, which is randomly triggered in the base game and on every free spin in the bonus round (more on the latter below). The screen darkens and up to three reels between 2 and 6 become wild for the current spin. Getting a win containing the wild symbols will cause them to shatter along with any other winning symbols before being replaced by regular paying symbols in the following Avalanche.\nTo trigger the Free Spins feature, you will need to land 4 Free Spins symbols anywhere on the reels in the same spin. Your reward is 8 free spins. You will receive another 4 free spins in addition to the minimum allocation for each extra Free Spins symbol that hits on the triggering spin. Landing 6 Free Spins symbols, for example, will give you 16 free spins.\nDuring the feature, at least 1 reel with be transformed into a Dazzling Wild Reel. The entire reel will be wild for that free spin and for any subsequent avalanche that follows.\nThen you have the Dazzling Wild Reels feature. The number of wilds that appear on a Dazzling Wild Reel starts at 2. There are opportunities to add to that number though. Each time you get a win that includes a wild, the counter for that reel increases by 1.\n            ",
