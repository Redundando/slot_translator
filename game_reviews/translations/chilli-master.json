The game is set in a festive atmosphere, with bright colors and flags that create an authentic Mexican ambiance. The graphics are well-designed, with symbols that are drawn so well that they make players feel like they are in front of a plate ready to enjoy a good Mexican meal.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nChilli Master has a high volatility and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 94.5%. However, it's important to remember that the RTP is a purely theoretical figure that only minimally affects the course of winnings, and is tested only on large numbers. The high volatility of the game means that players can potentially win large sums of money, but they'll have to be patient in waiting for a winning combination.\n\nPaylines and Symbols\n\nChilli Master has 5 reels and 3 rows with 20 fixed paylines. Winning combinations are formed by identical symbols on adjacent reels, from left to right, starting from the first reel. The game has non-themed symbols, the playing cards, and themed symbols that are related to Mexican cuisine, including avocado, burritos, tacos, the chef and spicy beans. The maximum win amount is 6,500 times the value of the bet.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nThe Chilli symbol is the Wild and can appear on all reels except the first. It replaces all symbols except the Scatter. If a combo is completed with a Wild, the amount won will be doubled. The Chef symbol is the Scatter and can appear anywhere on the reels. When three or more of these symbols land on the reels, players are awarded free spins during which they start with a 2x multiplier. If a Wild lands, the multiplier increases by one unit.\n\nFree Spins and Multipliers\n\nChilli Master offers players the opportunity to win free spins and multipliers. When players land three or more Chef symbols, they are awarded with free spins. During these free spins, players start with a 2x multiplier, and every time a Wild lands on the reels, the multiplier increases by one unit. This gives players the potential to win larger sums of money and makes the game more exciting.\n\n        \n            ",

The typical ingredient is chilli, the spicy pepper beloved by providers who often create themed slots. In Chilli Master, however, it's not just the pepper that's the star, but generally all the typical dishes that can be savored in a good Mexican restaurant. From burritos to tacos, passing through avocado and spicy beans.\n\nThe game is set in what appears to be some kind of party, with flags and bright colors.\n\nWith well-designed graphics, where the symbols are drawn so well that just looking at them is enough to make your mouth water, we are confident that Chilli Master will keep you company for several hours.\n\nChilli Master Features\n\nRealistic has opted for tradition, choosing a simple game grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. Here, our 20 fixed paylines are arranged, with a maximum win of 6,500 times the value of the bet.\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.20, while the maximum is €20.\n\nWinning combinations are those that involve identical symbols on adjacent reels, from left to right, starting from the first reel.\n\nAutomatic spins allow us to set a number of spins without the need to click the Play button every time.\n\nThe volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player is quite low, at 94.5%. However, we remember that this is a purely theoretical figure, tested only on large numbers and that it only minimally affects the course of winnings.\n\nSymbols and features of Chilli Master\n\nAs in the vast majority of slots, we also find non-themed symbols, the playing cards, which assign relatively low winnings. Much more rewarding are the symbols that take inspiration from Mexican cuisine: avocado, burritos, tacos, the chef and spicy beans reward us with amounts well above average.\n\nLet's move on to the special symbols: the chilli is our Wild, and can appear on all reels except the first, replacing all symbols except the Scatter. Furthermore, if a combo is completed with a Wild, the amount won will be doubled.\n\nThe chef is our Scatter and can land anywhere on the grid. With 3, 4 or 5 of these symbols, we will be awarded free spins during which we will start with a 2x multiplier. Every time a Wild lands, the multiplier will increase by one unit.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the maximum win amount?\n\nIn Chilli Master, you can win up to 6,500 times the value of the bet.\n\nCan I only play Chilli Master on PC?\n\nNo, absolutely not. Chilli Master is a game that also runs on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.\n\nHow many paylines does Chilli Master have?\n\nIn this slot, we have 20 fixed paylines, which means that the number cannot be varied.\n            ",

The typical ingredient is chilli, the spicy pepper beloved by providers who often create themed slots. In Chilli Master, however, it's not just the pepper that's the star, but generally all the typical dishes that can be savored in a good Mexican restaurant. From burritos to tacos, passing through avocado and spicy beans.\n\nThe game is set in what appears to be some kind of party, with flags and bright colors.\n\nWith well-designed graphics, where the symbols are drawn so well that just looking at them is enough to make your mouth water, we are confident that Chilli Master will keep you company for several hours.\n\nChilli Master Features\n\nRealistic has opted for tradition, choosing a simple game grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. Here, our 20 fixed paylines are arranged, with a maximum win of 6,500 times the value of the bet.\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.20, while the maximum is €20.\n\nWinning combinations are those that involve identical symbols on adjacent reels, from left to right, starting from the first reel.\n\nAutomatic spins allow us to set a number of spins without the need to click the Play button every time.\n\nThe volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player is quite low, at 94.5%. However, we remember that this is a purely theoretical figure, tested only on large numbers and that it only minimally affects the course of winnings.\n\nSymbols and features of Chilli Master\n\nAs in the vast majority of slots, we also find non-themed symbols, the playing cards, which assign relatively low winnings. Much more rewarding are the symbols that take inspiration from Mexican cuisine: avocado, burritos, tacos, the chef and spicy beans reward us with amounts well above average.\n\nLet's move on to the special symbols: the chilli is our Wild, and can appear on all reels except the first, replacing all symbols except the Scatter. Furthermore, if a combo is completed with a Wild, the amount won will be doubled.\n\nThe chef is our Scatter and can land anywhere on the grid. With 3, 4 or 5 of these symbols, we will be awarded free spins during which we will start with a 2x multiplier. Every time a Wild lands, the multiplier will increase by one unit.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the maximum win amount?\n\nIn Chilli Master, you can win up to 6,500 times the value of the bet.\n\nCan I only play Chilli Master on PC?\n\nNo, absolutely not. Chilli Master is a game that also runs on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.\n\nHow many paylines does Chilli Master have?\n\nIn this slot, we have 20 fixed paylines, which means that the number cannot be varied.\n            ",
