This thrilling game is played on a 7x7 grid, where players can bet from €0.10 to €100.00 per round on any device. There are six flag features that remove rows, add wilds, delete low-value symbols, and gift you with extra-sized symbols, including the Free Drops Bonus Game.\n\nAs an experienced gambler, you should know that the RTP is 96%, and you can win up to 2,500x your stake per spin/drop. The symbols include wells, targets, mushrooms, rabbits, frogs, goats, and the most rewarding symbol, the bull, which gives 250 times the total bet. The golden chalice is the wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the bonus scatter.\n\nSince it's a Cluster Pays slot, winning combinations are formed by obtaining 5 or more matching symbols in adjacent positions that must connect vertically or horizontally. When you get a win, a cascade is activated, and the winning clusters are removed to make room for new symbols to land, bringing consecutive wins.\n\nKeep an eye on the queued symbol rows! When a win is formed, a row of symbols is queued, provided there are no more winning combinations. The row where symbols can be removed is indicated by the Charging Knight. The symbols in the queue are used from left to right and connect with the icons on the grid to form the clusters. The symbols in the queue can contribute to different clusters on the same drop and remain in the queue until they are part of a winning cluster.\n\nFor experienced gamblers, the game's flag features are essential to making big wins. Each winning cluster symbol adds to the meter on the right side of the symbol grid. When the meter is full, a randomly selected flag feature is activated, and the meter is reset. The flag features are: \n\n- Enhanced Queue feature: all symbols in the queue can connect with the symbols on the grid to form winning clusters.\n- Charge feature: 2 to 5 rows of the grid are moved to the queue.\n- Epic Charge feature: All rows of the grid are moved to the queue.\n- Extra Wild feature: 3 to 6 wild symbols are randomly placed on the grid. \n- Inferno feature: all low-value symbols are removed from the grid.\n- Super Size feature: a large size, 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4, is randomly added to the grid to give you a winning cluster.\n\nThe Free Drops Bonus Game feature is triggered by getting three crown symbols, and with five free drops/spins awarded, you can reactivate the feature to get up to ten. Starting with an empty counter and queue, you can benefit from all the flag features described above.\n\nOverall, Micro Knights is a colorful and exciting game that rewards consecutive wins to activate flag features. As an experienced gambler, you should keep your sights set on the Super Size feature for the best chance at a guaranteed payout.",

It's played on a 7x7 grid, with bets ranging from €0.10 up to €100.00 per round on all devices. There are six banner features that remove rows, add wilds, remove low-value symbols, and give you extra symbols. This also applies to the Free Drops Bonus Game feature. The RTP is 96% and you can win up to 2,500x your bet for each spin/drop.\n\nTheme and special symbols of Micro Knights\nSymbols include:\n\nwells,\ntargets,\nmushrooms,\nrabbits,\nfrogs,\ngoats\nbulls - This is the most rewarding symbol that can give you 250 times the total bet.\nthe golden chalice is the wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the bonus scatter.\n\nBeing a Cluster Pays slot, winning combinations are formed by getting 5 or more matching symbols in adjacent positions that must connect vertically or horizontally. When you get a win, a cascade will be triggered and winning clusters will be removed to make way for new symbols to land, bringing consecutive wins.\nWatch out for symbol queues!\nWhen a win is formed, a line of symbols is queued up as long as there are no more winning combinations. The row where symbols can be removed is indicated by the Charging Knight. Symbols in the queue are used from left to right and connect with icons on the grid to form clusters. Symbols in the queue can contribute to multiple clusters in the same drop: they will remain in the queue until they are part of a winning cluster.\n\nBanner features\nEach symbol in a winning cluster is added to the symbol grid on the right: When the grid is full, a randomly selected banner feature is activated, while the grid is reset:\n\nEnhanced Queue feature: All symbols in the queue can connect with symbols on the grid to form winning clusters.\nCharge feature: Between 2 and 5 rows on the grid are moved to the queue.\nEpic Charge feature: All rows of the grid are moved to the queue.\nExtra Wild feature: Between 3 and 6 wild symbols are randomly placed on the grid.\nInferno feature: all low-value symbols are removed from the grid.\nSuper Size feature: A large size, 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4, is randomly added to the grid to give you a winning cluster.\n\nFree bonus game feature\nLook for the crown symbol as this is the bonus scatter - 3 of them will activate the Free Drops Bonus Game feature. With 5 free drops/spins assigned, you can reactivate the feature to reach 10. Starting from an empty counter and queue, you can benefit from all of the banner features described above.\n\nMy final thoughts on Micro Knights\nThe Micro Knights slot game is colorful and fun: the key is to get consecutive wins that add to the queue so that banner features are activated. The best feature is Super Size because a 4x4 symbol will result in a guaranteed payout.\n            ",

Being a Cluster Pays slot, winning combinations are formed by getting 5 or more matching symbols. When a win is formed, a cascade will be triggered and winning clusters will be removed to make way for new symbols to land, bringing consecutive wins. A player can win up to 2,500x their bet for each spin/drop.\n\nBanner features\n\nMicro Knights has six banner features that remove rows, add wilds, remove low-value symbols, and give you extra symbols. These features include: Enhanced Queue, Charge, Epic Charge, Extra Wild, Inferno, and Super Size. Each symbol in a winning cluster is added to the symbol grid on the right. When the grid is full, a randomly selected banner feature is activated while the grid is reset.\n\nFree Drops Bonus Game feature\n\nIf a player lands three crown symbols, the Free Drops Bonus Game feature will be activated. This feature awards 5 free drops/spins initially with the option to reactivate the feature to reach 10. Starting from an empty counter and queue, a player can benefit from all of the banner features mentioned above.\n\nPayouts and RTP\n\nThe payouts in Micro Knights range up to 2,500x the bet for each spin/drop, with an RTP of 96%. The bull symbol is the most rewarding and can give a player 250x the total bet.\n\nVisuals and theme\n\nMicro Knights is a fun medieval-themed game with a cartoon-inspired design that has graphics resembling those of PC games. The symbols include wells, targets, mushrooms, rabbits, frogs, goats, bulls, and the golden chalice, which is the wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the bonus scatter. The game is colorful and portrays knights charging around the grid with the Charging Knight keeping track of the symbol queue.\n\n        \n            ",

It's played on a 7x7 grid, with bets ranging from €0.10 up to €100.00 per round on all devices. There are six banner features that remove rows, add wilds, remove low-value symbols, and give you extra symbols. This also applies to the Free Drops Bonus Game feature. The RTP is 96% and you can win up to 2,500x your bet for each spin/drop.\n\nTheme and special symbols of Micro Knights\nSymbols include:\n\nwells,\ntargets,\nmushrooms,\nrabbits,\nfrogs,\ngoats\nbulls - This is the most rewarding symbol that can give you 250 times the total bet.\nthe golden chalice is the wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the bonus scatter.\n\nBeing a Cluster Pays slot, winning combinations are formed by getting 5 or more matching symbols in adjacent positions that must connect vertically or horizontally. When you get a win, a cascade will be triggered and winning clusters will be removed to make way for new symbols to land, bringing consecutive wins.\nWatch out for symbol queues!\nWhen a win is formed, a line of symbols is queued up as long as there are no more winning combinations. The row where symbols can be removed is indicated by the Charging Knight. Symbols in the queue are used from left to right and connect with icons on the grid to form clusters. Symbols in the queue can contribute to multiple clusters in the same drop: they will remain in the queue until they are part of a winning cluster.\n\nBanner features\nEach symbol in a winning cluster is added to the symbol grid on the right: When the grid is full, a randomly selected banner feature is activated, while the grid is reset:\n\nEnhanced Queue feature: All symbols in the queue can connect with symbols on the grid to form winning clusters.\nCharge feature: Between 2 and 5 rows on the grid are moved to the queue.\nEpic Charge feature: All rows of the grid are moved to the queue.\nExtra Wild feature: Between 3 and 6 wild symbols are randomly placed on the grid.\nInferno feature: all low-value symbols are removed from the grid.\nSuper Size feature: A large size, 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4, is randomly added to the grid to give you a winning cluster.\n\nFree bonus game feature\nLook for the crown symbol as this is the bonus scatter - 3 of them will activate the Free Drops Bonus Game feature. With 5 free drops/spins assigned, you can reactivate the feature to reach 10. Starting from an empty counter and queue, you can benefit from all of the banner features described above.\n\nMy final thoughts on Micro Knights\nThe Micro Knights slot game is colorful and fun: the key is to get consecutive wins that add to the queue so that banner features are activated. The best feature is Super Size because a 4x4 symbol will result in a guaranteed payout.\n            ",

The RTP is 96% and you can win up to 2,500x your bet for each spin/drop.\n\nTheme and special symbols of Micro Knights\nSymbols include:\n\nwells,\ntargets,\nmushrooms,\nrabbits,\nfrogs,\ngoats\nbulls - This is the most rewarding symbol that can give you 250 times the total bet.\nthe golden chalice is the wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the bonus scatter.\n\nBeing a Cluster Pays slot, winning combinations are formed by getting 5 or more matching symbols in adjacent positions that must connect vertically or horizontally. When you get a win, a cascade will be triggered and winning clusters will be removed to make way for new symbols to land, bringing consecutive wins.\nWatch out for symbol queues!\nWhen a win is formed, a line of symbols is queued up as long as there are no more winning combinations. The row where symbols can be removed is indicated by the Charging Knight. Symbols in the queue are used from left to right and connect with icons on the grid to form clusters. Symbols in the queue can contribute to multiple clusters in the same drop: they will remain in the queue until they are part of a winning cluster.\n\nBanner features\nEach symbol in a winning cluster is added to the symbol grid on the right: When the grid is full, a randomly selected banner feature is activated, while the grid is reset:\n\nEnhanced Queue feature: All symbols in the queue can connect with symbols on the grid to form winning clusters.\nCharge feature: Between 2 and 5 rows on the grid are moved to the queue.\nEpic Charge feature: All rows of the grid are moved to the queue.\nExtra Wild feature: Between 3 and 6 wild symbols are randomly placed on the grid.\nInferno feature: all low-value symbols are removed from the grid.\nSuper Size feature: A large size, 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4, is randomly added to the grid to give you a winning cluster.\n\nFree bonus game feature\nLook for the crown symbol as this is the bonus scatter - 3 of them will activate the Free Drops Bonus Game feature. With 5 free drops/spins assigned, you can reactivate the feature to reach 10. Starting from an empty counter and queue, you can benefit from all of the banner features described above.\n\nMy final thoughts on Micro Knights\nThe Micro Knights slot game is colorful and fun: the key is to get consecutive wins that add to the queue so that banner features are activated. The best feature is Super Size because a 4x4 symbol will result in a guaranteed payout.\n            ",
