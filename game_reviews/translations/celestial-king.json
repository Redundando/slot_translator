The game boasts stunning 3D animations and special effects, making it a joy to play. The Celestial King himself, a friendly green-eyed monkey, accompanies you throughout the game on one side of the reel grid, adding to the excitement of the game.\n\nVisuals and Theme\n\nCelestial King's visuals are stunning, with the game taking place in heaven amidst golden clouds and in the presence of the Celestial King, a friendly green-eyed monkey with a red headdress and scepter in his hand. The screen is set in an ethereal paradise with purple and golden clouds, mysterious pagodas surrounded by trees, and the game's symbols include Asian-style playing cards, lotus flowers, gold coins, a medal, a smiling pig, and a priestess.\n\nBetting and Jackpots\n\nCelestial King offers a betting range from a minimum of €0.50 to a maximum of €80, with the possibility of betting up to 50 coins per spin. The game also offers three jackpots, the Mini, Minor, and Major, with the latter only achievable with a minimum bet of €4 and with a value of up to 5,000 times the initial bet. The theoretical return to player (RTP) of this fantastic game is 96%, on par with other online casino games.\n\nSymbols and Payouts\n\nCelestial King's regular symbols feature Asian-style playing cards, lotus flowers, gold coins, a medal, a smiling pig, and a priestess. The priestess is the highest-paying symbol, offering up to 150 coins per pay line, if properly aligned. The Wild symbol is represented by the Celestial King himself, and the Scatter is represented by a Dragon. The Wild acts as both a jolly and a high-value symbol, offering up to 250 coins per pay line, and the Scatter offering free spins and an immediate prize of up to 750 times the bet if appearing three, four, or five times on the reels.\n\nBonus Rounds and Free Spins\n\nCelestial King offers free spins as a bonus round, triggered by getting three, four, or five Dragon Scatter symbols on the game's reels. The game's free spins round can earn up to 20 free spins, and the overall prize for this feature can be up to 750 times the total bet.\n\n        \n            ",
