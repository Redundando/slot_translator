Help the cute red crustacean dodge the fearsome fishing boats that have already caught his siblings, and in return, Larry will give you free spins and many bonus features.\n\nOur review\nThis online slot game consists of 5 reels and 40 paylines that go both ways. It is the sequel to the popular video slot game by IGT featuring the clever lobster named Larry. As in the previous version released in 2015, there are numerous extra features to take advantage of in order to bring home a nice sum. The gameplay mechanics are very fast, creating a dynamic effect during the game - boredom is impossible! The minimum bet is €1.00 up to a maximum of €10.00, and with the Bonus Game, you can get multipliers ranging from 40x to 95x the token value.\n \nWatch out for the symbols and tasty bonuses!\nAll the symbols of the Lucky Larry’s Lobstermania 2 slot machine are themed around the sea. If you manage to align at least three on an active payline, you'll start to collect your loot. Here's how:\n\nThere are two Wilds with the Lobster Mania 2 logo in different colors and with different payouts,\nThe Motorboat and the Buoy are worth the same,\nThe Water House and the Lighthouse are worth the same, but their value is lower than the previous symbols,\nFinally, there are the standard playing cards 8, 9, 10, J, Q, and K.\n\nImportant! The Jackpot symbol can appear on any icon except the Wild and can give you from a minimum of 2,500 coins up to 50,000 and more.\n \nAnd now let's take a look at the bonuses you could win:\n\nThere's a multiplier that can appear on the standard symbols Buoy, Water House, Lighthouse, and Motorboat and can increase your win by x3 or x5,\nIf you are able to align three or more Wilds, the Bonus Game is triggered and you can choose between two options: the Buoy Bonus, which will take you to Australia, Brazil, or Maine. Once you've chosen the destination, you'll have to select your three favorite buoys to discover the multiplier and prize. If you happen to catch the Golden Lobster, depending on your destination, you'll have to deal with kangaroos, pelicans, or octopuses. The second option is the Free Spins Bonus, the traditional 5 Free Spins Bonus with many Wilds available.\n\nOur conclusion\nIf, like us, you were already crazy about the first chapter of this adventurous slot machine, then you'll be excited about this sequel that doesn't require any download. And if you play with real money in one of our casinos, it will give you fabulous welcome bonuses. Unleash your bait, cast your traps and live an exciting online gaming experience in the company of friendly Larry!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions \nHow do I win the jackpot of Lucky Larry's Lobstermania 2?\n\nAlign 3 or more jackpot scatters on the screen to win one of the 3 set jackpot prizes displayed above the reels, and good luck!\n\nCan I play this slot for free on my mobile phone?\n\nCertainly.
