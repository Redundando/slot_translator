Ma se ti metti in gioco con i moltiplicatori in espansione nei giri liberi, le monete possono accumularsi rapidamente.

Each tumble increases the multiplier during free spins. Learn more in our Great Rhino Megaways review.\nAfrican Savanna Graphics\nRegarding graphic design, Pragmatic Play's slot experts have created a fully playable game that offers all that a Megaways slot can possibly offer. The symbols are not animated, but come to life when they become part of a winning result. The only symbol that truly moves in Great Rhino Megaways slots is the rhinoceros.\nYet, Megaways slots are a fun spectacle to watch and play, because they are always dynamic, unless the company has done a really poor job of making the game come to life. In addition to the gameplay, Great Rhino comes with a musical theme and a series of sound effects that imitate the atmosphere of a savanna, fitting perfectly with the game's mood.\nPragmatic Play has created a beautiful and sonorous slot in Great Rhino Megaways. The sunny African savanna serves as a backdrop to the action. You'll see trees, meadows and wild animals grazing. Activate the Free Spins feature and the day turns into night. The images are made in a comic book style and work very well. The same goes for the rhythmic and bouncy soundtrack.\nPragmatic Play's game interface is one of the best around. Setting bet levels, autoplay, and sound is incredibly simple. The paytable gives cash payouts rather than coins and is very detailed. It's all very intuitive.\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nSymbolic wins of three or more of the same kind are needed to win the game. These can happen on any of the six reels lines. Being a Megaways Slot, Great Rhino offers cascade wins, meaning consecutive wins that can go on until no other matching symbols appear on respins. In other words, if you're familiar with mobile games like Candy Crush, the mechanism is very similar.\nIn terms of value, the most profitable symbol is the cheetah. It pays the conventional standard amount when it comes to Megaways Slot Machines, which is 50x multiplied by the winning bet for six of the same. On the other hand, five of the same pay a better prize than other slots, with 25x.\nThe rest of the symbols on Great Rhino Megaways slots pay between 1x and 5x when six of the same appear on the reels. The wild symbol replaces all of these except for the scatter.\nBet levels offer something for players of all bankrolls. You can play from 20 cents to 100 euros per spin. If you use the Auto Bet feature, you can play from 25 cents to 125 euros per spin. Autoplay is available if requested. There are also options to set win and loss limits, and to stop autoplay when the Free Spins feature is triggered.\nThis safari-themed slot is quite wild when it comes to variance. The volatility of Great Rhino Megaways is extremely high. Expect fairly dry wins like the African savanna. But with expanding multipliers in free spins, coins can quickly add up. The maximum win per spin, particularly in the case of Free Spins, is 20,000x your bet.\nHere, too, the RTP is not bad. It's 96.48% if you don't use the Ante Bet feature. If you do, it slightly increases to 96.58%. This stacks up quite well against most online slots.\nA combination of basic Megaways features and a low-cost paid option that increases the chances of a feature being triggered makes Great Rhino a game worth considering. The maximum potential payout is 20,000x instead of the typical 10,000x and has an RTP that goes up to 96.58%.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nBlueprint Gaming takes us to the African savanna for a spin with the lions. It's an electrifying production that has all the features for an exciting online slot adventure, including the Ways Pays payout mechanism.\nThe Lion Thunder slot plays on four rows and six reels, which requires 4,096 ways to win made on consecutive reels. Wins are possible with two matching symbols starting from the leftmost reel. Any of the standard game symbols can be replaced by one or more wilds.",

                            "content": "Head to the wild plains of Africa for a highly volatile and thrilling Megaways slot game. Great Rhino Megaways, created by Pragmatic Play, boasts 6 beautifully-designed reels with up to 200,704 Megaways. Pragmatic Play has upped the excitement with their latest Megaways game, offering a potential win of 20,000x the winning bet. This is made possible through increasing multipliers during free spins, which can be triggered by players choosing a starting position. This high variance slot has an RTP of over 96.00%.\n\nUsing a reel game mechanic, the highlight of this game is its bonus round where players can choose from a variety of free spin combinations with starting multipliers. Each tumble increases the multiplier during free spins. Discover more in our review of Great Rhino Megaways.\n\nRegarding graphic design, the slot experts at Pragmatic Play have created a game that is completely playable and offers everything a Megaways slot can offer. Symbols come to life when they become part of a winning result. The only symbol that moves in Great Rhino Megaways is the rhinoceros.\n\nHowever, Megaways slots are always dynamic and fun to play, and Pragmatic Play has created a beautiful and sonorous slot in Great Rhino Megaways. The sunny African savannah provides a wonderful background to the action, with trees, fields, and wild animals grazing in the background. Activate the free spin function and the day turns into night. Images are made in a comic book style and work very well, with a rhythmic and bouncing soundtrack that perfectly matches the mood of the game.\n\nTo win the game, players need to land three or more of a kind on any of the six reels. Being a Megaways slot, Great Rhino offers cascading wins, which means that consecutive wins can continue until no more matching symbols appear on the respins. In short, if you’re familiar with mobile games like Candy Crush, the mechanism is very similar.\n\nIn terms of value, the most profitable symbol is the cheetah, which pays the standard conventional amount for Megaways slots, with 50x multiplied by the winning bet for six of the same symbol. On the other hand, five of the same symbol pays a better prize than other slots, with 25x.\n\nThe rest of the symbols in the Great Rhino Megaways slot pay between 1x and 5x when six of the same symbol appear on the reels. The wild symbol replaces all symbols except the scatter.\n\nThe betting levels offer something for players of all bankrolls, ranging from 20 cents to 100 euros per spin. If you use the Auto Bet function, you can play from 25 cents to 125 euros per spin. Autoplay is available upon request, and there are also options for setting win and loss limits as well as terminating autoplay when free spins are triggered.\n\nThis safari-themed slot is quite wild in terms of variance. The volatility of Great Rhino Megaways is extremely high, so expect relatively dry wins like the African savannah. But if you activate the expanding multipliers during free spins, coins can quickly accumulate. The maximum win per spin, particularly in the case of free spins, is 20,000x your bet.\n\nA combination of basic Megaways features and a low-cost pay option that increases the chances of a feature being triggered make Great Rhino a game worth considering. The potential maximum payout is 20,000x instead of the typical 10,000x, and it has an RTP that tops out at 96.58%.\n\nFor similar slot machines, Blueprint Gaming takes us to the African savannah for a ride with lions. It's an electrifying production that has everything for an exciting online slot adventure, including the Ways Pays payment mechanism. Lion Thunder slot plays on four rows and six reels, which requires 4,096 ways to win made on consecutive reels. Wins are possible with two matching symbols starting from the leftmost reel. Any of the standard game symbols can be replaced by the wild or wilds."

The volatility of Great Rhino Megaways is extremely high. Expect fairly dry wins like the African savanna. But with expanding multipliers in free spins, coins can quickly add up. The maximum win per spin, particularly in the case of Free Spins, is 20,000x your bet.\nHere, too, the RTP is not bad. It's 96.48% if you don't use the Ante Bet feature. If you do, it slightly increases to 96.58%. This stacks up quite well against most online slots.\nA combination of basic Megaways features and a low-cost paid option that increases the chances of a feature being triggered makes Great Rhino a game worth considering. The maximum potential payout is 20,000x instead of the typical 10,000x and has an RTP that goes up to 96.58%.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nBlueprint Gaming takes us to the African savanna for a spin with the lions. It's an electrifying production that has all the features for an exciting online slot adventure, including the Ways Pays payout mechanism.\nThe Lion Thunder slot plays on four rows and six reels, which requires 4,096 ways to win made on consecutive reels. Wins are possible with two matching symbols starting from the leftmost reel. Any of the standard game symbols can be replaced by one or more wilds.\n            ",

Created by Pragmatic Play, this beautifully designed 6-reel slot can have up to 200,704 Megaways.\nPragmatic Play is upping the excitement in their latest Megaways game, offering 20,000x on the winning bet. This is possible thanks to the increasing multipliers during free bonus spins, which can be retriggered and allow players to choose a starting position. It's a high variance slot with an RTP over 96.00%.\nPlayed using a reel game mechanic, the other highlight is the bonus round where you can choose from a variety of free spin and starting multiplier combinations. Each tumble increases the multiplier during free spins. Learn more in our Great Rhino Megaways review.\nAfrican Savanna Graphics\nRegarding graphic design, Pragmatic Play's slot experts have created a fully playable game that offers all that a Megaways slot can possibly offer. The symbols are not animated, but come to life when they become part of a winning result. The only symbol that truly moves in Great Rhino Megaways slots is the rhinoceros.\nYet, Megaways slots are a fun spectacle to watch and play, because they are always dynamic, unless the company has done a really poor job of making the game come to life. In addition to the gameplay, Great Rhino comes with a musical theme and a series of sound effects that imitate the atmosphere of a savanna, fitting perfectly with the game's mood.\nPragmatic Play has created a beautiful and sonorous slot in Great Rhino Megaways. The sunny African savanna serves as a backdrop to the action. You'll see trees, meadows and wild animals grazing. Activate the Free Spins feature and the day turns into night. The images are made in a comic book style and work very well. The same goes for the rhythmic and bouncy soundtrack.\nPragmatic Play's game interface is one of the best around. Setting bet levels, autoplay, and sound is incredibly simple. The paytable gives cash payouts rather than coins and is very detailed. It's all very intuitive.\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nSymbolic wins of three or more of the same kind are needed to win the game. These can happen on any of the six reels lines. Being a Megaways Slot, Great Rhino offers cascade wins, meaning consecutive wins that can go on until no other matching symbols appear on respins. In other words, if you're familiar with mobile games like Candy Crush, the mechanism is very similar.\nIn terms of value, the most profitable symbol is the cheetah. It pays the conventional standard amount when it comes to Megaways Slot Machines, which is 50x multiplied by the winning bet for six of the same. On the other hand, five of the same pay a better prize than other slots, with 25x.\nThe rest of the symbols on Great Rhino Megaways slots pay between 1x and 5x when six of the same appear on the reels. The wild symbol replaces all of these except for the scatter.\nBet levels offer something for players of all bankrolls. You can play from 20 cents to 100 euros per spin. If you use the Auto Bet feature, you can play from 25 cents to 125 euros per spin. Autoplay is available if requested. There are also options to set win and loss limits, and to stop autoplay when the Free Spins feature is triggered.\nThis safari-themed slot is quite wild when it comes to variance. The volatility of Great Rhino Megaways is extremely high. Expect fairly dry wins like the African savanna. But with expanding multipliers in free spins, coins can quickly add up. The maximum win per spin, particularly in the case of Free Spins, is 20,000x your bet.\nHere, too, the RTP is not bad. It's 96.48% if you don't use the Ante Bet feature. If you do, it slightly increases to 96.58%. This stacks up quite well against most online slots.\nA combination of basic Megaways features and a low-cost paid option that increases the chances of a feature being triggered makes Great Rhino a game worth considering.

It's a high variance slot with an RTP over 96.00%.\n\nPayouts and Prizes\n\nThe cheetah is the most profitable symbol, paying 50x multiplied by the winning bet for six of the same.

The RTP is 96.48% without the Ante Bet feature and up to 96.58% with it.\n\nTheme and Graphics\n\nGreat Rhino Megaways takes place in the sunny African savanna, featuring trees, meadows and wild animals grazing. The game is designed in a comic book style and has a bouncy soundtrack that fits well with the game's mood. Pragmatic Play's graphic design is fully playable and offers all that a Megaways slot can possibly offer. \n\nInterface and Compatibility\n\nThe game interface is one of the best around.

Created by Pragmatic Play, this beautifully designed 6-reel slot can have up to 200,704 Megaways.\nPragmatic Play is upping the excitement in their latest Megaways game, offering 20,000x on the winning bet. This is possible thanks to the increasing multipliers during free bonus spins, which can be retriggered and allow players to choose a starting position. It's a high variance slot with an RTP over 96.00%.\nPlayed using a reel game mechanic, the other highlight is the bonus round where you can choose from a variety of free spin and starting multiplier combinations. Each tumble increases the multiplier during free spins. Learn more in our Great Rhino Megaways review.\nAfrican Savanna Graphics\nRegarding graphic design, Pragmatic Play's slot experts have created a fully playable game that offers all that a Megaways slot can possibly offer. The symbols are not animated, but come to life when they become part of a winning result. The only symbol that truly moves in Great Rhino Megaways slots is the rhinoceros.\nYet, Megaways slots are a fun spectacle to watch and play, because they are always dynamic, unless the company has done a really poor job of making the game come to life. In addition to the gameplay, Great Rhino comes with a musical theme and a series of sound effects that imitate the atmosphere of a savanna, fitting perfectly with the game's mood.\nPragmatic Play has created a beautiful and sonorous slot in Great Rhino Megaways. The sunny African savanna serves as a backdrop to the action. You'll see trees, meadows and wild animals grazing. Activate the Free Spins feature and the day turns into night. The images are made in a comic book style and work very well. The same goes for the rhythmic and bouncy soundtrack.\nPragmatic Play's game interface is one of the best around. Setting bet levels, autoplay, and sound is incredibly simple. The paytable gives cash payouts rather than coins and is very detailed. It's all very intuitive.\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nSymbolic wins of three or more of the same kind are needed to win the game. These can happen on any of the six reels lines. Being a Megaways Slot, Great Rhino offers cascade wins, meaning consecutive wins that can go on until no other matching symbols appear on respins. In other words, if you're familiar with mobile games like Candy Crush, the mechanism is very similar.\nIn terms of value, the most profitable symbol is the cheetah. It pays the conventional standard amount when it comes to Megaways Slot Machines, which is 50x multiplied by the winning bet for six of the same. On the other hand, five of the same pay a better prize than other slots, with 25x.\nThe rest of the symbols on Great Rhino Megaways slots pay between 1x and 5x when six of the same appear on the reels. The wild symbol replaces all of these except for the scatter.\nBet levels offer something for players of all bankrolls. You can play from 20 cents to 100 euros per spin. If you use the Auto Bet feature, you can play from 25 cents to 125 euros per spin. Autoplay is available if requested. There are also options to set win and loss limits, and to stop autoplay when the Free Spins feature is triggered.\nThis safari-themed slot is quite wild when it comes to variance. The volatility of Great Rhino Megaways is extremely high. Expect fairly dry wins like the African savanna. But with expanding multipliers in free spins, coins can quickly add up. The maximum win per spin, particularly in the case of Free Spins, is 20,000x your bet.\nHere, too, the RTP is not bad. It's 96.48% if you don't use the Ante Bet feature. If you do, it slightly increases to 96.58%. This stacks up quite well against most online slots.\nA combination of basic Megaways features and a low-cost paid option that increases the chances of a feature being triggered makes Great Rhino a game worth considering. The maximum potential payout is 20,000x instead of the typical 10,000x and has an RTP that goes up to 96.58%.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nBlueprint Gaming takes us to the African savanna for a spin with the lions. It's an electrifying production that has all the features for an exciting online slot adventure, including the Ways Pays payout mechanism.\nThe Lion Thunder slot plays on four rows and six reels, which requires 4,096 ways to win made on consecutive reels. Wins are possible with two matching symbols starting from the leftmost reel. Any of the standard game symbols can be replaced by one or more wilds.\n            ",

Created by Pragmatic Play, this beautifully designed 6-reel slot can have up to 200,704 Megaways.\nPragmatic Play is upping the excitement in their latest Megaways game, offering 20,000x on the winning bet. This is possible thanks to the increasing multipliers during free bonus spins, which can be retriggered and allow players to choose a starting position. It's a high variance slot with an RTP over 96.00%.\nPlayed using a reel game mechanic, the other highlight is the bonus round where you can choose from a variety of free spin and starting multiplier combinations. Each tumble increases the multiplier during free spins. Learn more in our Great Rhino Megaways review.\nAfrican Savanna Graphics\nRegarding graphic design, Pragmatic Play's slot experts have created a fully playable game that offers all that a Megaways slot can possibly offer. The symbols are not animated, but come to life when they become part of a winning result. The only symbol that truly moves in Great Rhino Megaways slots is the rhinoceros.\nYet, Megaways slots are a fun spectacle to watch and play, because they are always dynamic, unless the company has done a really poor job of making the game come to life. In addition to the gameplay, Great Rhino comes with a musical theme and a series of sound effects that imitate the atmosphere of a savanna, fitting perfectly with the game's mood.\nPragmatic Play has created a beautiful and sonorous slot in Great Rhino Megaways. The sunny African savanna serves as a backdrop to the action. You'll see trees, meadows and wild animals grazing. Activate the Free Spins feature and the day turns into night. The images are made in a comic book style and work very well. The same goes for the rhythmic and bouncy soundtrack.\nPragmatic Play's game interface is one of the best around. Setting bet levels, autoplay, and sound is incredibly simple. The paytable gives cash payouts rather than coins and is very detailed. It's all very intuitive.\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nSymbolic wins of three or more of the same kind are needed to win the game. These can happen on any of the six reels lines. Being a Megaways Slot, Great Rhino offers cascade wins, meaning consecutive wins that can go on until no other matching symbols appear on respins. In other words, if you're familiar with mobile games like Candy Crush, the mechanism is very similar.\nIn terms of value, the most profitable symbol is the cheetah. It pays the conventional standard amount when it comes to Megaways Slot Machines, which is 50x multiplied by the winning bet for six of the same. On the other hand, five of the same pay a better prize than other slots, with 25x.\nThe rest of the symbols on Great Rhino Megaways slots pay between 1x and 5x when six of the same appear on the reels. The wild symbol replaces all of these except for the scatter.\nBet levels offer something for players of all bankrolls. You can play from 20 cents to 100 euros per spin. If you use the Auto Bet feature, you can play from 25 cents to 125 euros per spin. Autoplay is available if requested. There are also options to set win and loss limits, and to stop autoplay when the Free Spins feature is triggered.\nThis safari-themed slot is quite wild when it comes to variance. The volatility of Great Rhino Megaways is extremely high. Expect fairly dry wins like the African savanna. But with expanding multipliers in free spins, coins can quickly add up. The maximum win per spin, particularly in the case of Free Spins, is 20,000x your bet.\nHere, too, the RTP is not bad. It's 96.48% if you don't use the Ante Bet feature. If you do, it slightly increases to 96.58%. This stacks up quite well against most online slots.\nA combination of basic Megaways features and a low-cost paid option that increases the chances of a feature being triggered makes Great Rhino a game worth considering. The maximum potential payout is 20,000x instead of the typical 10,000x and has an RTP that goes up to 96.58%.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nBlueprint Gaming takes us to the African savanna for a spin with the lions. It's an electrifying production that has all the features for an exciting online slot adventure, including the Ways Pays payout mechanism.\nThe Lion Thunder slot plays on four rows and six reels, which requires 4,096 ways to win made on consecutive reels. Wins are possible with two matching symbols starting from the leftmost reel. Any of the standard game symbols can be replaced by one or more wilds.\n            ",
