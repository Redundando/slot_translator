    "original_text": "\nLeprechaun Rama\nUna delle figure già famose della tradizione irlandese è il Leprechaun, il simpatico folletto calzolaio avido che vive in solitudine nei boschi. In Leprechaun Rama il nostro eroe è rappresentato come una rana con la barba rossa (altro elemento tipico dell’iconografia irlandese) e un cilindro sulla testa.  Lo sfondo del gioco è la sua casa dove è custodito un pentolone colmo di monete. Sulla sinistra c’è un contatore suddiviso in tacche che può essere riempito grazie ad alcuni elementi del gioco che illustreremo più in là. I rulli sono invisibili e i simboli appaiono all’interno di bolle che esplodono a seguito di ogni combinazione vincente. La grafica è ottima e ricorda quella dei cartoni animati.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLeprechaun Rama ha una griglia quadrata 5×5 e utilizza un metodo di gioco a cascata: ogni volta che si ottiene una combinazione vincente, le bolle esplodono e vengono rimpiazzate da altri simboli. Si tratta di una slot All Ways, ciò vuol dire che le combinazioni pagano in ogni direzione e non solo da sinistra a destra come accade di solito. Le puntate possono essere modificate attraverso il tasto Step. I modi per vincere sono 351 e il valore RTP è del 97,15%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nI simboli in questa slot sono tutti legati alla tradizione irlandese: si va dal ferro di cavallo alla ghianda, passando per la fiaschetta di whiskey, il quadrifoglio e i numeri 3 e 9.\nQuesta slot ha un sistema multistep, con livelli si attivano con il raggiungimento di determinati obiettivi. Ogni volta che compare una chiave, essa andrà a finire nel contatore di sinistra e farà aumentare il livello. Alle chiavi sono legati i progressi e il raggiungimento dei livelli successivi.\nNel primo livello, denominato Leprechaun’s Lair, sulla griglia può apparire un pentolone verde carico di monete d’oro. Esso uscirà dalla bolla e rovescerà il denaro nel pentolone principale che si trova accanto alla griglia. Aumenta ogni volta del 20% la nostra puntata. Ad esso è legata una funzione speciale. Di tanto in tanto e in modo casuale, il Leprechaun si berrà una bella birra fresca che farà esplodere tutti i simboli e ne farà atterrare di nuovi.\nIl secondo livello è detto Faury’s Forest. In questo caso il pentolone che appare sui rulli è d’argento e fa aumentare il denaro del 40%. La funzione casuale è la trasformazione di una fila di bolle in un unico colore.\nIl terzo livello è chiamato Rancher’s Riches e il montepremi verrà aumentato del 60%. Di tanto in tanto alcune bolle verranno trasformate in Wild dando vita a diverse combinazioni vincenti. Alla fine, quando l’arcobaleno che illumina il pentolone sarà completo, si potrà partecipar dal gioco Gamble per incassare o incrementare ancor di più la vincita, con il rischio però di perdere tutto.\n",

            "response": "Leprechaun Rama is a top-notch slot game that brings the famous Irish folklore figure, the Leprechaun, to life in an unexpected way. This game offers a unique twist, as our hero is portrayed as a red-bearded frog wearing a top hat. The game is set in his home, with a pot of overflowing coins waiting to be won. The reels are invisible, and symbols appear inside bursting bubbles after each winning combination. The graphics are outstanding and reminiscent of animated cartoons.\n\nThe slot features a 5x5 square grid and cascading reels, where winning combinations trigger bubbles to burst and are replaced by new symbols. This is an All Ways slot, meaning that combinations pay out in all directions, not just from left to right as usual. The betting range is adjustable with the Step button. This game has 351 ways to win and an impressive RTP value of 97.15%.\n\nAll symbols in Leprechaun Rama are tied to Irish traditions, featuring a horseshoe, acorn, whiskey flask, four-leaf clover, and numbers 3 and 9. The game also features a multistep system, with levels that are activated by reaching specific milestones. Whenever a key appears, it is added to the left counter and increases the level. Progress and reaching higher levels are linked to keys.\n\nIn the first level, Leprechaun's Lair, a green pot of gold coins may appear on the grid. When it does, it spills its contents into the main pot beside the grid, increasing our bet by 20%. The level is also linked to a special feature, where the Leprechaun takes a sip of beer and triggers the bursting of all symbols, replaced by new ones.\n\nThe second level is called Faury's Forest, where a silver pot appears on the reels, increasing the prize by 40%. The random function in this level transforms a row of bubbles into a single color.\n\nFinally, the third level, Rancher's Riches, increases the jackpot by 60%. Here, random bubbles are transformed into Wild symbols, increasing the chances of winning combinations. When the pot's rainbow is complete, players can go to the Gamble game to cash out or try to increase their winnings with the risk of losing everything.\n\nIn conclusion, Leprechaun Rama is a fantastic game that provides a unique and exciting experience.

When players win, symbols burst and are replaced by new symbols. It's an All Ways slot, meaning that combinations pay out in all directions. Players can adjust their bets using the Step button. The game features 351 ways to win and an RTP value of 97.15%.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics in Leprechaun Rama are outstanding and reminiscent of animated cartoons. All symbols are tied to Irish traditions, featuring a horseshoe, acorn, whiskey flask, four-leaf clover, and numbers 3 and 9. The game is set in Leprechaun's home, with a pot of overflowing coins waiting to be won. The reels are invisible, and symbols appear inside bursting bubbles after each winning combination.\n\nAll Ways slot system\n\nLeprechaun Rama is an All Ways slot, which means that combinations pay out in all directions, not just from left to right as usual. This unique feature provides players with endless chances to win and makes for an exciting and unpredictable gameplay experience.\n\nMultistep system\n\nLeprechaun Rama features a multistep system. There are three levels, and each level is activated by reaching specific milestones. Whenever a key appears, it adds to the left counter and increases the level. In the first level, Leprechaun's Lair, a green pot of gold coins may appear on the grid, and when it does, it spills its contents into the main pot beside the grid, increasing the bet by 20%. The second level, Faury's Forest, increases the prize by 40%, and the third level, Rancher's Riches, increases the jackpot by 60%.\n\nRTP value\n\nLeprechaun Rama has an RTP value of 97.15%, which is higher than the average online slot game. This means that players have a higher chance of winning in this game than in many others. It's an exciting game that provides endless opportunities for players to win big!\n\n        \n            ",

This game offers a unique twist, as our hero is portrayed as a red-bearded frog wearing a top hat. The game is set in his home, with a pot of overflowing coins waiting to be won. The reels are invisible, and symbols appear inside bursting bubbles after each winning combination. The graphics are outstanding and reminiscent of animated cartoons.\n\nThe slot features a 5x5 square grid and cascading reels, where winning combinations trigger bubbles to burst and are replaced by new symbols. This is an All Ways slot, meaning that combinations pay out in all directions, not just from left to right as usual. The betting range is adjustable with the Step button. This game has 351 ways to win and an impressive RTP value of 97.15%.\n\nAll symbols in Leprechaun Rama are tied to Irish traditions, featuring a horseshoe, acorn, whiskey flask, four-leaf clover, and numbers 3 and 9. The game also features a multistep system, with levels that are activated by reaching specific milestones. Whenever a key appears, it is added to the left counter and increases the level. Progress and reaching higher levels are linked to keys.\n\nIn the first level, Leprechaun's Lair, a green pot of gold coins may appear on the grid. When it does, it spills its contents into the main pot beside the grid, increasing our bet by 20%. The level is also linked to a special feature, where the Leprechaun takes a sip of beer and triggers the bursting of all symbols, replaced by new ones.\n\nThe second level is called Faury's Forest, where a silver pot appears on the reels, increasing the prize by 40%. The random function in this level transforms a row of bubbles into a single color.\n\nFinally, the third level, Rancher's Riches, increases the jackpot by 60%. Here, random bubbles are transformed into Wild symbols, increasing the chances of winning combinations. When the pot's rainbow is complete, players can go to the Gamble game to cash out or try to increase their winnings with the risk of losing everything.\n\nIn conclusion, Leprechaun Rama is a fantastic game that provides a unique and exciting experience. It's sure to appeal to any experienced gambler looking for a thrilling adventure with endless chances of winning.\n            ",
