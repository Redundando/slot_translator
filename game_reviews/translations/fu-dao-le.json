On paper, we find ourselves in front of a classic online slot with a 5 * 3 mechanism and an RTP of 96%. The volatility is medium and there are a certain amount of special features within it.\n\nThe Gong is one of the special symbols: it acts as both a Wild, substituting for the other symbols in the various combinations, and a Scatter. By finding at least three, we will be assigned free spins, a mode that allows us to obtain new spins every time we find shields during our spins.\n\nIn short, Fu Dao Le's special mode proves to be extremely captivating and enjoyable, but thanks to the golden rolls, it will not be necessary to wait for it to go to enjoy the slot.\n\nSimilar slots to Fu Dao Le\n\nEast and slot machines are such an ingrained combination that it is not difficult to find slots that share the same atmosphere as Fu Dao Le. If we wanted to make some names to recommend to our readers who enjoyed the slot we talked about in this review, we could mention Dragon Tiger by Pragmatic Play, or even Indian Ruby by Merkur Gaming (moving towards India, in fact) or finally Golden Asia by Shuffle Master.\n        ",
