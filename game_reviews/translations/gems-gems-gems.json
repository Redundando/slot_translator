For example, if you get a wild reel on the main reel set, it will be transferred to the same reel across the other 3 smaller reel sets.\nWhat Are the Main Symbols in Gems Gems Gems?\n\nThe special Wild symbol is the Gems Gems Gems icon that can replace the Feature in order to create the highest possible combination on a payline;\nthe special Feature symbol is a huge and sparkling Diamond.\n\nBoth Wild and Feature symbols that land on the main reel set are replicated exactly in the same positions on the other three smaller reels, in order to offer additional chances of winning, with a special sound played every time they are copied.\nThe other standard symbols include emeralds, sapphires and rubies that are available in different shapes and sizes.\nMain Feature: Free Spins\nThe main attraction of this jewel-studded game is the Free Spins feature: if you get 3 or more Diamond symbols on any of the reel sets, you'll trigger it:\n\n3 diamonds on one reel set will give you 10 free spins with a total of 20 possible free spins\n4 diamonds will give you the same plus 1 times the bet\n5 diamonds will give you 10 free spins with 2 times your bet as a cash prize.\n\nHow Does the Gems Gems Gems Multiplier Work?\n\n10 free spins with a 3x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 1 reel set\n10 free spins with a 6x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 2 reel sets\n10 free spins with a 9x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 3 reel sets\n10 free spins with a 12x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds across all 4 reel sets\n\nIn the feature, only 1 reel set is used, so to win big, you need a couple of wild reels on some free spins.\nMy Final Conclusion\nTrying out this game, I was able to win 15 times my bet in the base game with one spin. I also played the Free Spins feature and was able to win just under 100 times my bet, so there's something a bit unstable about its actual gameplay.

For example, if you get a wild reel on the main reel set, it will be transferred to the same reel across the other 3 smaller reel sets.\nWhat Are the Main Symbols in Gems Gems Gems?\n\nThe special Wild symbol is the Gems Gems Gems icon that can replace the Feature in order to create the highest possible combination on a payline;\nthe special Feature symbol is a huge and sparkling Diamond.\n\nBoth Wild and Feature symbols that land on the main reel set are replicated exactly in the same positions on the other three smaller reels, in order to offer additional chances of winning, with a special sound played every time they are copied.\nThe other standard symbols include emeralds, sapphires and rubies that are available in different shapes and sizes.\nMain Feature: Free Spins\nThe main attraction of this jewel-studded game is the Free Spins feature: if you get 3 or more Diamond symbols on any of the reel sets, you'll trigger it:\n\n3 diamonds on one reel set will give you 10 free spins with a total of 20 possible free spins\n4 diamonds will give you the same plus 1 times the bet\n5 diamonds will give you 10 free spins with 2 times your bet as a cash prize.\n\nHow Does the Gems Gems Gems Multiplier Work?\n\n10 free spins with a 3x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 1 reel set\n10 free spins with a 6x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 2 reel sets\n10 free spins with a 9x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 3 reel sets\n10 free spins with a 12x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds across all 4 reel sets\n\nIn the feature, only 1 reel set is used, so to win big, you need a couple of wild reels on some free spins.\nMy Final Conclusion\nTrying out this game, I was able to win 15 times my bet in the base game with one spin. I also played the Free Spins feature and was able to win just under 100 times my bet, so there's something a bit unstable about its actual gameplay. To be honest, I found the game a bit slow including the background music. Surely there's good potential for big wins, but the game didn't fully convince me. Among the slots produced by WMS, I'd prefer to spend my time playing:\n\nhttps://www.slotjava.it/slot/the-wizard-of-oz/\nhttps://www.slotjava.it/slot/the-wizard-of-oz-ruby-slippers/\nhttps://www.slotjava.it/slot/forbidden-dragon/\n        ",

Keep reading and discover how to collect these luxurious and sparkling gemstones!\nMain Gameplay of Gems Gems Gems\nGems Gems Gems has a main reel set of 5 reels with 3 additional sets of 5 reels on the right. Powered by WMS Gaming, it is a Super Multi-Pay slot that has 80 paylines but is played with 40 coins (1 coin for 2 paylines). It has the same layout as the game Bruce Lee Dragon’s Tale, based on beautiful gems. With this slot, you can bet from €0.40 to €80.00 per spin. The unusual reel layout sees wild symbols and features from the main reel set replicated across the other 3 smaller reel sets to give you more chances of winning. For example, if you get a wild reel on the main reel set, it will be transferred to the same reel across the other 3 smaller reel sets.\nWhat Are the Main Symbols in Gems Gems Gems?\n\nThe special Wild symbol is the Gems Gems Gems icon that can replace the Feature in order to create the highest possible combination on a payline;\nthe special Feature symbol is a huge and sparkling Diamond.\n\nBoth Wild and Feature symbols that land on the main reel set are replicated exactly in the same positions on the other three smaller reels, in order to offer additional chances of winning, with a special sound played every time they are copied.\nThe other standard symbols include emeralds, sapphires and rubies that are available in different shapes and sizes.\nMain Feature: Free Spins\nThe main attraction of this jewel-studded game is the Free Spins feature: if you get 3 or more Diamond symbols on any of the reel sets, you'll trigger it:\n\n3 diamonds on one reel set will give you 10 free spins with a total of 20 possible free spins\n4 diamonds will give you the same plus 1 times the bet\n5 diamonds will give you 10 free spins with 2 times your bet as a cash prize.\n\nHow Does the Gems Gems Gems Multiplier Work?\n\n10 free spins with a 3x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 1 reel set\n10 free spins with a 6x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 2 reel sets\n10 free spins with a 9x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 3 reel sets\n10 free spins with a 12x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds across all 4 reel sets\n\nIn the feature, only 1 reel set is used, so to win big, you need a couple of wild reels on some free spins.\nMy Final Conclusion\nTrying out this game, I was able to win 15 times my bet in the base game with one spin. I also played the Free Spins feature and was able to win just under 100 times my bet, so there's something a bit unstable about its actual gameplay. To be honest, I found the game a bit slow including the background music. Surely there's good potential for big wins, but the game didn't fully convince me. Among the slots produced by WMS, I'd prefer to spend my time playing:\n\nhttps://www.slotjava.it/slot/the-wizard-of-oz/\nhttps://www.slotjava.it/slot/the-wizard-of-oz-ruby-slippers/\nhttps://www.slotjava.it/slot/forbidden-dragon/\n            ",

It has 80 paylines but is played with 40 coins (1 coin for 2 paylines). It has the same layout as Bruce Lee Dragon’s Tale and you can bet from €0.40 to €80.00 per spin. The wild symbols and features from the main reel set are replicated across the other 3 smaller reel sets to give you more chances of winning.\n\nWild symbols and replication across smaller reels\n\nThe special Wild symbol is the Gems Gems Gems icon that can replace the Feature in order to create the highest possible combination on a payline. It is exactly replicated in the same positions on the other three smaller reels whenever it lands on the main reel set, giving you more chances of winning. The same applies to the Feature symbol, which is a huge and sparkling Diamond. In both cases, a special sound is played every time they are copied.\n\nFree spins feature and Diamond symbols\n\nThe main attraction of Gems Gems Gems is the Free Spins feature. If you get 3 or more Diamond symbols on any of the reel sets, you'll trigger it. Depending on the number of diamonds you land, you'll get between 10 and 20 free spins and up to 2 times your bet as a cash prize. In the feature, only 1 reel set is used, and the multiplier can increase up to 12x if you land diamonds on all 4 reel sets.\n\nPotential for big wins\n\nWhile the game is a bit slow and the background music could be better, there's good potential for big wins in Gems Gems Gems. In the base game, you can win up to 15 times your bet with one spin, and during the Free Spins feature, you can win up to 12x your bet with a couple of wild reels. However, the game could be more stable, as some players may not achieve such high payouts during their gameplay.\n\nAlternative WMS Gaming slot games\n\nIf you're looking for other slot games produced by WMS, there are many options available. Some of the most popular ones are The Wizard of Oz, The Wizard of Oz Ruby Slippers, and Forbidden Dragon. Each of them has its own unique features and potential payouts, so give them a try to see which one best suits your preferences.\n\n        \n            ",

If a player gets a wild reel on the main reel set, it will be transferred to the same reel across the other 3 smaller reel sets.\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nThe game's main attraction is the Free Spins feature, which is triggered when the player gets 3 or more Diamond symbols on any of the reel sets. The number of free spins awarded depends on the number of diamond symbols landed.

For example, if you get a wild reel on the main reel set, it will be transferred to the same reel across the other 3 smaller reel sets.\nWhat Are the Main Symbols in Gems Gems Gems?\n\nThe special Wild symbol is the Gems Gems Gems icon that can replace the Feature in order to create the highest possible combination on a payline;\nthe special Feature symbol is a huge and sparkling Diamond.\n\nBoth Wild and Feature symbols that land on the main reel set are replicated exactly in the same positions on the other three smaller reels, in order to offer additional chances of winning, with a special sound played every time they are copied.\nThe other standard symbols include emeralds, sapphires and rubies that are available in different shapes and sizes.\nMain Feature: Free Spins\nThe main attraction of this jewel-studded game is the Free Spins feature: if you get 3 or more Diamond symbols on any of the reel sets, you'll trigger it:\n\n3 diamonds on one reel set will give you 10 free spins with a total of 20 possible free spins\n4 diamonds will give you the same plus 1 times the bet\n5 diamonds will give you 10 free spins with 2 times your bet as a cash prize.\n\nHow Does the Gems Gems Gems Multiplier Work?\n\n10 free spins with a 3x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 1 reel set\n10 free spins with a 6x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 2 reel sets\n10 free spins with a 9x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds on 3 reel sets\n10 free spins with a 12x multiplier for 3 or more diamonds across all 4 reel sets\n\nIn the feature, only 1 reel set is used, so to win big, you need a couple of wild reels on some free spins.\nMy Final Conclusion\nTrying out this game, I was able to win 15 times my bet in the base game with one spin. I also played the Free Spins feature and was able to win just under 100 times my bet, so there's something a bit unstable about its actual gameplay. To be honest, I found the game a bit slow including the background music. Surely there's good potential for big wins, but the game didn't fully convince me. Among the slots produced by WMS, I'd prefer to spend my time playing:\n\nhttps://www.slotjava.it/slot/the-wizard-of-oz/\nhttps://www.slotjava.it/slot/the-wizard-of-oz-ruby-slippers/\nhttps://www.slotjava.it/slot/forbidden-dragon/\n            ",
