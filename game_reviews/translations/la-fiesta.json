It features a colorful and vibrant design that reflects traditional Spanish festivals. It has 5 reels, 4 rows, and 40 fixed paylines, with a betting range of €0.10 up to €100. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.19%.\n\nGame Mechanics\n\nThe game is played with a 5x4 reel grid, with 40 fixed paylines. You can bet from €0.10 up to €100. The game mechanics are simple, with the highest winning combination paid out per line. There is a Gamble function to try to double your winnings, and players can activate up to 100 automatic spins.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nLa Fiesta has numerous symbols, with 4 Wilds and 4 Bonus symbols. The symbol that pays the most is the bull, followed by the matador, a boy, and girl in typical Spanish festival attire. The lowest value symbols are vials shaped in playing card symbols. The four Wild symbols are inspired by traditional Spanish festivals, and the four Bonus symbols are guitars and maracas, roses, tomatoes, and bulls. Each Scatter symbol activates a mini-game that takes its name and symbols from one of four different traditional festivals in Spain: Falleras, Tomatina, Pamplona, and San Joan.\n\nBonus Rounds and Free Spins\n\nLa Fiesta slot has several Scatter symbols that can activate mini-games. When you get three Scatter symbols, you get four free spins and a mini-game that changes based on the symbol that appeared on the fifth reel. The Falleras mini-game awards a free spin for every rose that lands, and if a golden rose appears, you get a +1 multiplier with the free spin. In the Tomatina mini-game, every time a Wild lands on the reels, it becomes sticky and remains fixed during the next spins. Pamplona mini-game gives you six Free Spins and the stacked bull symbol. Lastly, in the San Joan mini-game, the horse is the main symbol, and it is associated with Respins and multipliers.\n\nOverall Experience\n\nLa Fiesta is an engaging and colorful slot game with interesting game mechanics and features. The design, graphics, and music reflect traditional Spanish festivals, and each mini-game adds an extra layer of excitement to the overall gaming experience. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is fair, and the game offers many ways to increase your winnings, including automatic spins and a Gamble function.\n\n        \n            ",

Some typical examples are the Valencia Falleras' roses, the tomato-slinging battles of Tomatina, and the San Joan festival in Minorca. Then there's the Pamplona festival with bulls and, of course, bullfighting with matadors. Relax Gaming is appreciated by players all over the world for both the functionality of its products and the attention it pays to the graphic component, features that are also found in La Fiesta. In the background, you can see the streets of the city adorned with flags and colorful lights that run from one building to another, and a bull that occasionally peeks through the game grid. At the bottom of the screen, there is all the information related to the bet, while on the right side, there are buttons with which to customize the game according to our preferences. A cheerful and engaging music increases the festive atmosphere that is breathed during the Spins.\nMain features\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 4 rows, with 40 fixed paylines on which to bet from €0.10 up to €100. When there are multiple winning combinations on the same line, the highest one is paid out. If the combinations are on different lines, then the amounts will be added up. La Fiesta has a good theoretical return to player (RTP), equal to 96.19%. You can activate up to a maximum of 100 automatic spins, and there is the Gamble function with which to try to double your winnings.\nSymbols and Features\nThis slot has numerous symbols, 4 Wilds, and 4 Bonuses. By far, the symbol that pays the most is the bull, followed by the matador. Finally, there are the boy and girl dressed in typical Spanish festival attire. The lowest value is that of vials in the shape of playing card symbols. There are 4 Wild symbols, and they refer to traditional Spanish festivals: a tomato, a crushed tomato, a donkey, and a horse. The latter two symbols are expanding, covering the entire reel. Wild symbols have the function of a wildcard and replace all other symbols. La Fiesta has several Scatter symbols: guitar and maracas, roses, tomatoes, and the bull. With 3 symbols, you are entitled to 4 free spins and a mini-game that changes based on the symbol that appeared on the fifth reel. The mini-games take their name and symbols from 4 different traditional festivals in Spain: Falleras, Tomatina, Pamplona, and San Joan. Let's see their features in detail:\n\nFalleras: for every rose that lands during the Bonus game, you get an additional free spin. If a golden rose lands, in addition to a free spin, you get a +1 multiplier.\nTomatina: Every time a Wild lands on the reels, it becomes sticky and remains fixed during the following spins.\nPamplona: you will have 6 Free Spins and the stacked bull symbol.\nSan Joan: The horse is the main symbol, and it is associated with Respins and multipliers.\n            ",
