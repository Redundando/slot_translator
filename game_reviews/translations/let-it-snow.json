The RTP is average, at 96.35%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\n\nThere are 8 regular symbols and 1 expansion symbol. The stick, bell, Christmas ball, and stocking are the ones with the lower value. With a minimum bet of €0.20, you win from €0.02 with 6 symbols to a maximum of €2 with 15 or more symbols.

With \"Let it Snow\", you can indulge in your passion for slots in a Christmas atmosphere complete with impressive graphics. Inspired by winter, the background features a beautiful expanse of pure white snow and soft snowflakes falling gently on the surrounding trees and mountain peaks.\n\nThe game board is nailed to a wooden panel with the name of the slot boldly displayed, with the letter O in SNOW actually functioning as a compass that activates a bonus feature, as we'll see later. The bottom of the screen is fairly clear, with only the balance, menu button, and standard buttons: one to change the bet amount, one to spin, and one to activate Autoplay.\n\nFeatures of \"Let it Snow\":\n\nThe large square-shaped game board has 6 reels and 6 rows. You win by connecting 6 or more symbols anywhere on the board. The betting range is quite wide, making the game suitable for any pocket, from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €100 per spin. Through the Autoplay feature, you can set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins that can be stopped at any time by pressing the stop button. From the menu, you can speed up the reel rotation, turn off the music, and access the paytable.\n\nThe volatility is medium, so you win with a good frequency, and the amounts are well balanced, not too low or too astronomical! The RTP is average, at 96.35%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\n\nThere are 8 regular symbols and 1 expansion symbol. The stick, bell, Christmas ball, and stocking are the ones with the lower value. With a minimum bet of €0.20, you win from €0.02 with 6 symbols to a maximum of €2 with 15 or more symbols. The rewards for the Christmas tree and gingerbread man vary between €0.10 and €12, while the snowman and Santa Claus offer sums ranging from €0.20 to €26.\n\nOur expansion symbol is the gift. Every time it appears, the compass above the game board advances as many notches as there are gifts on the reels. With 5 symbols, the feature is activated, and the gifts multiply. With 6 gifts, you win €0.20, with a number of symbols ranging from 20 to 24, you can take home €10, and with 30 or more symbols, the prize is €200!\n\nThe red gift box with the \"Free Spins\" label is our Scatter symbol. If it appears 3 times, we are awarded 10 free spins during which every gift symbol activates the compass. During free spins, additional expanding symbols appear.\n\nThe blue gift box with the \"Bonus\" label activates a second feature. Instead of the game board, a wheel divided into sections appears. Depending on where the arrow stops, we could win multipliers that are added to each spin. It starts with a 1x multiplier and progresses to 10x, 25x, 100x, and 250x. You can get up to 50 spins. The bonus game ends when the indicator stops on the skull. \n\nOverall, \"Let it Snow\" is a perfect choice for experienced gamblers looking for a fun and lucrative holiday-themed slot game.\n            ",

With 6 gifts, you win €0.20, with a number of symbols ranging from 20 to 24, you can take home €10, and with 30 or more symbols, the prize is €200! The second feature is activated by the blue gift box with the 'Bonus' label. Instead of the game board, a wheel divided into sections appears. You could win multipliers that are added to each spin, and it starts with a 1x multiplier, progresses to 10x, 25x, 100x, and 250x. You can get up to 50 spins, and this bonus game ends when the indicator stops on the skull.\n\nDesign and Graphics\n\nLet It Snow's design and graphics are impressive and capture the holiday season really well. The background is a beautiful expanse of pure white snow and soft snowflakes, and it has a large square-shaped game board nailed to a wooden panel with the name of the slot boldly displayed. There are eight regular symbols and one expanding symbol, each featuring Christmas-themed pictures such as Santa Claus and the Christmas tree. The symbols and graphics are all well-designed and work together seamlessly.\n\nPayouts\n\nThe payouts for Let It Snow are relatively well-balanced. There are eight regular symbols, with the stick, bell, Christmas ball, and stocking being the lowest-value symbols. You win from €0.02 with 6 symbols to a maximum of €2 with 15 or more symbols. The prizes for the Christmas tree and gingerbread man vary between €0.10 and €12. The snowman and Santa Claus offer sums ranging from €0.20 to €26. The volatility is medium, so you win relatively frequently, and the RTP is average, at 96.35%.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nOverall, Let it Snow is a perfect choice for gamblers looking for a fun and lucrative holiday-themed slot game. It is easy to play, has a wide betting range and impressive graphics. It also has two bonus features that can significantly boost your winnings.\n\n        \n            ",

With \"Let it Snow\", you can indulge in your passion for slots in a Christmas atmosphere complete with impressive graphics. Inspired by winter, the background features a beautiful expanse of pure white snow and soft snowflakes falling gently on the surrounding trees and mountain peaks.\n\nThe game board is nailed to a wooden panel with the name of the slot boldly displayed, with the letter O in SNOW actually functioning as a compass that activates a bonus feature, as we'll see later. The bottom of the screen is fairly clear, with only the balance, menu button, and standard buttons: one to change the bet amount, one to spin, and one to activate Autoplay.\n\nFeatures of \"Let it Snow\":\n\nThe large square-shaped game board has 6 reels and 6 rows. You win by connecting 6 or more symbols anywhere on the board. The betting range is quite wide, making the game suitable for any pocket, from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €100 per spin. Through the Autoplay feature, you can set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins that can be stopped at any time by pressing the stop button. From the menu, you can speed up the reel rotation, turn off the music, and access the paytable.\n\nThe volatility is medium, so you win with a good frequency, and the amounts are well balanced, not too low or too astronomical! The RTP is average, at 96.35%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\n\nThere are 8 regular symbols and 1 expansion symbol. The stick, bell, Christmas ball, and stocking are the ones with the lower value. With a minimum bet of €0.20, you win from €0.02 with 6 symbols to a maximum of €2 with 15 or more symbols. The rewards for the Christmas tree and gingerbread man vary between €0.10 and €12, while the snowman and Santa Claus offer sums ranging from €0.20 to €26.\n\nOur expansion symbol is the gift. Every time it appears, the compass above the game board advances as many notches as there are gifts on the reels. With 5 symbols, the feature is activated, and the gifts multiply. With 6 gifts, you win €0.20, with a number of symbols ranging from 20 to 24, you can take home €10, and with 30 or more symbols, the prize is €200!\n\nThe red gift box with the \"Free Spins\" label is our Scatter symbol. If it appears 3 times, we are awarded 10 free spins during which every gift symbol activates the compass. During free spins, additional expanding symbols appear.\n\nThe blue gift box with the \"Bonus\" label activates a second feature. Instead of the game board, a wheel divided into sections appears. Depending on where the arrow stops, we could win multipliers that are added to each spin. It starts with a 1x multiplier and progresses to 10x, 25x, 100x, and 250x. You can get up to 50 spins. The bonus game ends when the indicator stops on the skull. \n\nOverall, \"Let it Snow\" is a perfect choice for experienced gamblers looking for a fun and lucrative holiday-themed slot game.\n            ",

The bottom of the screen is fairly clear, with only the balance, menu button, and standard buttons: one to change the bet amount, one to spin, and one to activate Autoplay.\n\nFeatures of \"Let it Snow\":\n\nThe large square-shaped game board has 6 reels and 6 rows. You win by connecting 6 or more symbols anywhere on the board. The betting range is quite wide, making the game suitable for any pocket, from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €100 per spin. Through the Autoplay feature, you can set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins that can be stopped at any time by pressing the stop button. From the menu, you can speed up the reel rotation, turn off the music, and access the paytable.\n\nThe volatility is medium, so you win with a good frequency, and the amounts are well balanced, not too low or too astronomical! The RTP is average, at 96.35%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\n\nThere are 8 regular symbols and 1 expansion symbol. The stick, bell, Christmas ball, and stocking are the ones with the lower value. With a minimum bet of €0.20, you win from €0.02 with 6 symbols to a maximum of €2 with 15 or more symbols. The rewards for the Christmas tree and gingerbread man vary between €0.10 and €12, while the snowman and Santa Claus offer sums ranging from €0.20 to €26.\n\nOur expansion symbol is the gift. Every time it appears, the compass above the game board advances as many notches as there are gifts on the reels. With 5 symbols, the feature is activated, and the gifts multiply. With 6 gifts, you win €0.20, with a number of symbols ranging from 20 to 24, you can take home €10, and with 30 or more symbols, the prize is €200!\n\nThe red gift box with the \"Free Spins\" label is our Scatter symbol. If it appears 3 times, we are awarded 10 free spins during which every gift symbol activates the compass. During free spins, additional expanding symbols appear.\n\nThe blue gift box with the \"Bonus\" label activates a second feature. Instead of the game board, a wheel divided into sections appears. Depending on where the arrow stops, we could win multipliers that are added to each spin. It starts with a 1x multiplier and progresses to 10x, 25x, 100x, and 250x. You can get up to 50 spins. The bonus game ends when the indicator stops on the skull. \n\nOverall, \"Let it Snow\" is a perfect choice for experienced gamblers looking for a fun and lucrative holiday-themed slot game.\n            ",
