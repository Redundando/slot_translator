The RTP, at 94%, is slightly lower than the online slot average but is balanced with the game mechanics and features. The game's volatility is average, making it a balanced experience between moderate and high rewards. The most interesting symbol is LRH, a Scatter symbol that triggers free bonus spins. During these spins, the reels have targets to fill and, once filled, become entirely covered with Wilds for the rest of the mode, making it rich in its final part.\n\nSymbolism and design\n\nLady Robin Hood features symbols inspired by the mythical English hero. These symbols include the damsel with the bow, arrows, beer mug, and the coins stolen from the rich (to give to the poor). The slot game's graphics are built on a parchment-like background, where the image of Sherwood Forest is highlighted. We noticed the classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q...) being similar to other Bally slot machine symbols, indicating they may have been recycled. Overall, the slot machine has an attractive graphic and thematic design.\n\nBonus modes and free spins\n\nThe wild symbol in Lady Robin Hood, represented by LRH, triggers a free bonus spin. In this mode, targets appear on the reels that need to be filled with arrows. When the targets are completely filled (requiring four arrows), the corresponding reel becomes completely covered with Wilds for the rest of the mode, making it a lucrative experience. This game mechanic motivates players to keep playing to access the bonus mode and win the highest rewards.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nLady Robin Hood has a lower-than-average RTP of 94%, but this is balanced out by the game's mechanics, which is suitable for both moderate and high rewards. The game's volatility is average, so it doesn't particularly lean toward enormous winnings or long stretches without any rewards. However, the bonus mode does make a difference by adding an extra layer of excitement, making this game an entertaining experience.\n\nComparison to similar slot games\n\nEven though Robin Hood-themed slot machines are not new in the online gaming space, Lady Robin Hood still manages to distinguish itself with unique game mechanics and bonus modes. It's different from Robin Hood: Shifting Riches from NetEnt, which has a standard five-reels type game grid. Lady Robin Hood uses a 4*4 type game grid, which shakes up the player's expectations, as well as a unique bonus mode that NetEnt's Robin Hood game doesn't offer. Overall, Lady Robin Hood stands out from the other Robin Hood-themed slots in the market.\n\n        \n            ",

(4 bullet points)\n- Bullet lists briefly covering the topic \"What we don't like\". (2 bullet pints)\n- SEO optimized meta title with a maximum length of 45 characters. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics and rules of Lady Robin Hood\n\nLady Robin Hood is a 4x4 slot machine with twenty symbols displayed at each play. It has an RTP of 94%, which is slightly lower than average. The gameplay is fun, especially with the bonus mode which triggers free spins. The slot machine has an average volatility.\n\nSymbols and the game grid of Lady Robin Hood\n\nThe game grid of Lady Robin Hood appears on a rolled parchment and has a background that evokes Sherwood Forest where the story of Robin Hood is set. The symbols include classic playing cards (A, K, Q...) and main symbols based on Robin Hood, including a damsel with a bow, arrows, a beer mug, and stolen coins. The most interesting symbol is the Scatter symbol LRH, which triggers the bonus mode with free spins.\n\nBonus features and free spins of Lady Robin Hood\n\nThe bonus mode of Lady Robin Hood is triggered by the LRH Scatter symbol, which awards free spins. During the free spins, targets may appear on the reels, and filling all of them with four arrows will cover the corresponding reel entirely with Wilds for the remainder of the mode. This feature is very rewarding. \n\nReturn to player percentage (RTP) and volatility of Lady Robin Hood\n\nLady Robin Hood has an RTP of 94%, which is slightly lower than average. The volatility is average, so the slot machine does not heavily favor enormous winnings, nor does it result in many spins without a win. \n\nComparison to similar slot games, such as Robin Hood: Shifting Riches\n\nRobin Hood is not the most popular character in online slots, but there are still some slot machines that feature this character. One of these is Robin Hood: Shifting Riches from NetEnt. Compared to it, Lady Robin Hood has a similar theme, but the gameplay mechanics are different, with more emphasis on the free spins feature. \n\n        \n            ",

Heroes become heroines, villains become villains, because anyone can be anything.\n\nRiding the wave of this way of thinking, we find Lady Robin Hood from Bally, a slot machine that swaps the gender of the most famous archer of all time, making her the heroine of Sherwood Forest (ideal since Robin is a name that can be male or female in English).\n\nLet's discover together what this slot has to offer us, analyzing it from a graphic point of view and then moving on to a more technical and detailed analysis.\n\nLady Robin Hood – Arrows and Daggers\n\nAt the opening of the slot machine, we are greeted by rather raucous music, so we advise users to proceed with caution. The game grid appears to be built on a rolled parchment and contains the various symbols that will compose the various combinations.\n\nAmong these, we find the classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q...), very similar to others already used by Bally in its slot machines, and since they are secondary symbols, it is likely that they have been recycled. The main symbols recall the myth of Robin Hood: from the damsel with the bow to the arrows, from the beer mug to the coins stolen from the rich to give to the poor.\n\nAll built on the image that serves as the background for the game interface, which naturally wants to evoke Sherwood Forest where the events of the well-known (or well-known) Robin Hood are set.\n\nLady Robin Hood – Hit the Target\n\nTo begin, the game mechanism of Lady Robin Hood is very fun, particularly the bonus mode which we will discuss shortly. We are faced with a 4*4 type game grid, which shows twenty symbols at each play.\n\nThe RTP is 94%, slightly lower than the average value of 96 found in online slots, but it does not make much difference considering the functions of the slot machine itself. The volatility is average, so the slot machine does not tilt in favor of enormous winnings but neither tens of spins without a single win.\n\nThe most interesting symbol is certainly LRH (the initials of the slot), a Scatter symbol that allows us to access the bonus mode with free spins. During these spins, we can find targets among the reels, which will fill indicators above reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. Once an indicator is filled (four arrows are required), the corresponding reel will become entirely covered with Wilds for the rest of the mode, making this function rich in its final part.\n\nSlots similar to Lady Robin Hood\n\nRobin Hood is not the most popular character in online slots, but despite this, it is still possible to find slot machines that use this character as a theme. One in particular is Robin Hood: Shifting Riches from NetEnt.\n            ",

Heroes become heroines, villains become villains, because anyone can be anything.\n\nRiding the wave of this way of thinking, we find Lady Robin Hood from Bally, a slot machine that swaps the gender of the most famous archer of all time, making her the heroine of Sherwood Forest (ideal since Robin is a name that can be male or female in English).\n\nLet's discover together what this slot has to offer us, analyzing it from a graphic point of view and then moving on to a more technical and detailed analysis.\n\nLady Robin Hood – Arrows and Daggers\n\nAt the opening of the slot machine, we are greeted by rather raucous music, so we advise users to proceed with caution. The game grid appears to be built on a rolled parchment and contains the various symbols that will compose the various combinations.\n\nAmong these, we find the classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q...), very similar to others already used by Bally in its slot machines, and since they are secondary symbols, it is likely that they have been recycled. The main symbols recall the myth of Robin Hood: from the damsel with the bow to the arrows, from the beer mug to the coins stolen from the rich to give to the poor.\n\nAll built on the image that serves as the background for the game interface, which naturally wants to evoke Sherwood Forest where the events of the well-known (or well-known) Robin Hood are set.\n\nLady Robin Hood – Hit the Target\n\nTo begin, the game mechanism of Lady Robin Hood is very fun, particularly the bonus mode which we will discuss shortly. We are faced with a 4*4 type game grid, which shows twenty symbols at each play.\n\nThe RTP is 94%, slightly lower than the average value of 96 found in online slots, but it does not make much difference considering the functions of the slot machine itself. The volatility is average, so the slot machine does not tilt in favor of enormous winnings but neither tens of spins without a single win.\n\nThe most interesting symbol is certainly LRH (the initials of the slot), a Scatter symbol that allows us to access the bonus mode with free spins. During these spins, we can find targets among the reels, which will fill indicators above reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. Once an indicator is filled (four arrows are required), the corresponding reel will become entirely covered with Wilds for the rest of the mode, making this function rich in its final part.\n\nSlots similar to Lady Robin Hood\n\nRobin Hood is not the most popular character in online slots, but despite this, it is still possible to find slot machines that use this character as a theme. One in particular is Robin Hood: Shifting Riches from NetEnt.\n        ",
