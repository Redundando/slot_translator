La slot Crusader ha scelto una tematica un po’ particolare, poiché chiama in causa le crociate, le grandi battaglie che iGaming ha deciso di reinterpretare. La videoslot che approda sui casinò online dal 17 marzo ti porta quindi in un tempo passato, a vivere la storica Battaglia di Acri contro i Mamelucchi, un esercito egiziano medievale.

Ovviamente un po’ dark, con atmosfere tristi, che rappresentano al meglio l’intenzione della battaglia. Anche in questo caso per ottenere la vittoria servirà allineare almeno 3 simboli in una linea di pagamento, da sinistra a destra. E’ molto affascinante l’immagine sullo sfondo, con una fortezza circondata da un cielo rossastro. Per il resto, a livello di grafica non abbiamo note degne di attenzione: resta tutto abbastanza in linea con il concetto di guerra. Ma oltre al suo look che cosa troviamo? Parliamo di simboli, che prevedono il guerriero, pronto a dominare la scena, affiancato dagli scudi, da un pugnale, un calice e le icone classiche delle carte, ovvero A, K, Q. Non perdere mai di vista il simbolo del calice, perché offre fino a 10 volte la scommessa qualora appaia 5 volte sui rulli. In questo modo potrai vincere fino a 2.500 volte la tua puntata soprattutto se sfrutti le funzioni bonus.\nIl simbolo Crusader è la nostra icona jolly che può innescare il Crusader Wild, utile per accedere a uno o più spin gratuiti. Quando attivi questa fase, cerca il simbolo di espansione, che è una freccia, utile per aggiungere più righe e quindi più linee di pagamento. L’importante è che si posizioni sui rulli 2, 3 e 4. Considera che la griglia può continuare a ingrandirsi fino al 5×12 e, ogni volta che si aggiunge una riga, il giocatore riceve un giro gratuito.\nPer ogni giro potrai scommettere tra 0,10 e 100€ e usando il pulsante automatico farai autonomamente girare le ruote mantenendo sempre le impostazioni che hai scelto.

Parliamo così di una percentuale che è piuttosto buona rispetto alle slot virtuali. Nel complesso è quindi un titolo che potrà incuriosire soprattutto i neofiti, tentati dall’idea di poter tentare una vincita fino a 2.500x. Le funzionalità sono buone, ma non convince completamente la sua grafica, che potrebbe risultare un pochino noiosa rispetto alle aspettative iniziali.

Crusader slot has chosen a rather unique theme, as it revolves around the Crusades, the great battles that iGaming has decided to reinterpret. This video slot, which landed on online casinos on March 17th, takes you back in time to live the historical Battle of Acre against the Mamelukes, a medieval Egyptian army. Without delving too much into the technicalities of the history itself, let's talk about its structure, starting with gameplay that relies on 5 reels and 26 paylines, which become 98 if you unlock the bonus. \n\nFor experienced gamblers, the design of a slot confronting such an intense and combative theme would be inevitably dark, with sad atmospheres that could aptly represent the actual purpose of the battle. To win, align at least 3 symbols on a payline, from left to right. The background image, featuring a fortress surrounded by a reddish sky, is very fascinating. The graphics are consistent with the concept of war. Symbols include the warrior, who dominates the scene, shields, a dagger, a chalice, and classic card icons, i.e., A, K, Q. Keep an eye on the chalice symbol, as it offers up to 10 times the bet if it appears 5 times on the reels. This way, you can win up to 2,500 times your bet, especially if you take advantage of the bonus features. \n\nThe Crusader symbol is our wild icon that can trigger the Crusader Wild, useful for accessing one or more free spins. When you activate this feature, look for the expansion symbol, which is an arrow, useful for adding more rows and therefore more paylines. It must position itself on reels 2, 3, and 4. Note that the grid can continue to expand up to 5×12, and each time a row is added, the player receives a free spin. \n\nYou can bet between 0.10 and 100€ per spin, and using the autoplay button, you will make the reels spin automatically while always retaining the settings you have chosen. If you use this autoplay button, remember that you will not be able to set maximum loss limits. \n\nTo conclude, let's talk about the last technical data of the Crusader slot: its RTP value, which is 96.1%, on average, compared to online titles. Therefore, it is a percentage that is quite good compared to virtual slots. Overall, it is a title that will capture and pique the interest of mainly newcomers, tempted by the idea of trying their luck with a 2,500x win. The features are good, but the graphics might not entirely convince some gamers, resulting in a slight drop in entertainment.",

Look no further! The Crusader slot has chosen a unique theme that calls upon the Crusades, the great battles that iGaming has decided to reinterpret. This video slot, which landed on online casinos on March 17th, takes you back in time to relive the historic Battle of Acre against the Mamelukes, a medieval Egyptian army.\n\nLet's skip the technical parts of the story and talk about the gameplay, which relies on 5 reels and 26 paylines, which become 98 if the bonus is unlocked. The design of a slot game that tackles such a combative theme must be dark, with somber atmospheres that best represent the intention of battle. It is genuinely captivating to see the fortress in the background, surrounded by a reddish sky. The graphics are in line with the concept of war, so there are no noteworthy notes to make. The symbols include a warrior, ready to dominate the scene, alongside shields, a dagger, a chalice, and the classic card icons, namely A, K, Q. Keep an eye out for the chalice symbol, as it offers up to 10 times the bet if it appears five times on the reels. You can win up to 2,500 times your bet, particularly if you take advantage of the bonus features.\n\nThe Crusader symbol is the wild icon that can trigger the Crusader Wild, useful for accessing one or more free spins. When you activate this phase, look for the expansion symbol, which is an arrow, useful for adding more rows and therefore more pay lines. The important thing is that it is positioned on reels 2, 3, and 4.

This percentage is quite good compared to virtual slots. Overall, it's a title that will intrigue novice players, tempted by the idea of trying to win up to 2,500x. The features are good, but the graphics may not fully convince players, as they might find them a bit dull compared to initial expectations. However, rest assured that entertainment will not be lacking, although it might drop a little for some gamers.\n            ",

If the bonus round is triggered, the paylines increase to 98. The expansion symbol, an arrow, can be found on reels 2, 3, and 4, and it expands the grid up to 5x12.

The autoplay option can be used, but there are no maximum loss limits available.\n\nTheme\n\nThe theme of the Crusader slot is the historic Battle of Acre between Crusaders and Mamelukes. The game captures the combative and somber atmosphere of warfare and features a fortress in the background surrounded by a reddish sky.\n\nDesign\n\nThe design of the Crusader slot is dark and in line with the theme of battle. The graphics are good and represent the theme well, but some players may find them a bit dull compared to initial expectations.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols in Crusader include a warrior, shields, a dagger, a chalice, and the classic card icons A, K, Q. The chalice symbol offers up to 10 times the bet if it appears five times on the reels. The Crusader symbol is the wild icon that can trigger the Crusader Wild, which leads to free spins. The expansion symbol, an arrow, can also be found during the bonus round, which adds more rows and paylines. \n\nRTP\n\nThe RTP value of the Crusader slot is 96.1%, which is average in comparison to other online slot titles. This percentage is quite good compared to virtual slots.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\nCrusader relies on 5 reels and 26 paylines, which become 98 if the bonus is unlocked. You can bet between 0.10 and €100 for each spin, and by using the auto-play button, you can make the reels spin autonomously while maintaining the settings you have chosen. If you use this autoplay button, remember that you cannot set maximum loss limits.\n\nDesign\n\nThe design of Crusader has a dark, somber atmosphere that represents the intention of battle. It features a fortress in the background, surrounded by a reddish sky. The symbols include a warrior, shields, a dagger, a chalice, and the classic card icons, namely A, K, Q. The graphics are in line with the concept of war, but some players might find them a bit dull compared to initial expectations.\n\nTheme\n\nCrusader has a unique theme that calls upon the Crusades, the great battles of medieval times. It takes you back in time to the Battle of Acre against the Mamelukes, a medieval Egyptian army. The fortress in the background and the warrior symbols create an authentic atmosphere that battle enthusiasts will appreciate. \n\nBonus Features\n\nThe Crusader symbol is the wild icon that can trigger the Crusader Wild, useful for accessing one or more free spins. When you activate this phase, look for the expansion symbol, which is an arrow, useful for adding more rows and therefore more pay lines. The grid can continue to expand up to 5x12, and each time a row is added, the player receives a free spin. The chalice symbol offers up to 10 times the bet if it appears five times on the reels. \n\nRTP\n\nThe Crusader slot's RTP value is equal to 96.1%, making it average in comparison to other online titles. This percentage is quite good compared to virtual slots.\n\n        \n            ",

Look no further! The Crusader slot has chosen a unique theme that calls upon the Crusades, the great battles that iGaming has decided to reinterpret. This video slot, which landed on online casinos on March 17th, takes you back in time to relive the historic Battle of Acre against the Mamelukes, a medieval Egyptian army.\n\nLet's skip the technical parts of the story and talk about the gameplay, which relies on 5 reels and 26 paylines, which become 98 if the bonus is unlocked. The design of a slot game that tackles such a combative theme must be dark, with somber atmospheres that best represent the intention of battle. It is genuinely captivating to see the fortress in the background, surrounded by a reddish sky. The graphics are in line with the concept of war, so there are no noteworthy notes to make. The symbols include a warrior, ready to dominate the scene, alongside shields, a dagger, a chalice, and the classic card icons, namely A, K, Q. Keep an eye out for the chalice symbol, as it offers up to 10 times the bet if it appears five times on the reels. You can win up to 2,500 times your bet, particularly if you take advantage of the bonus features.\n\nThe Crusader symbol is the wild icon that can trigger the Crusader Wild, useful for accessing one or more free spins. When you activate this phase, look for the expansion symbol, which is an arrow, useful for adding more rows and therefore more pay lines. The important thing is that it is positioned on reels 2, 3, and 4. Consider the fact that the grid can continue to expand up to 5x12, and each time a row is added, the player receives a free spin.\n\nFor each spin, you can bet between 0.10 and €100, and by using the auto-play button, you can make the reels spin autonomously while maintaining the settings you have chosen. If you use this autoplay button, remember that you cannot set maximum loss limits.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Crusader slot\n\nLet's conclude with one last technical detail of the Crusader slot: its RTP value, which is equal to 96.1%, making it average in comparison to other online titles. This percentage is quite good compared to virtual slots. Overall, it's a title that will intrigue novice players, tempted by the idea of trying to win up to 2,500x. The features are good, but the graphics may not fully convince players, as they might find them a bit dull compared to initial expectations. However, rest assured that entertainment will not be lacking, although it might drop a little for some gamers.\n        ",
