With its cartoon-style graphics and accurately drawn symbols, Knight Hot Spotz captures your attention at first glance.\n\nKnight Hot Spotz Features:\n\nThe 5x4 grid features 25 fixed paylines, with bets starting at €0.01 per payline, making each spin cost a minimum of €0.25. Of course, betting can be raised up to €125. To win, you must match at least three identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right, with a maximum win of 2,000 times your wager in both the base game and the special features. To speed up gameplay, access the menu and activate Quick Spin or take advantage of Autoplay, which allows you to set a variable number of automatic spins.\n\nKnight Hot Spotz is highly volatile and has an RTP of 95.5%.\n\nKnight Hot Spotz Mechanics:\n\nThe ten symbols consist of eight normal and two special symbols. The J through Ace playing cards are worth a meager amount, while the sword and shield, map, dragon egg, and pig all provide higher rewards.\n\nThe chest is the Wild symbol and completes active combinations by substituting for all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter symbol, which depicts the knight, appears on all reels and pays out six free spins when six land in a single spin. Any position that held a Scatter that triggered the feature will be marked with a colored frame. The same will happen with all other Scatters that land during the Bonus game. At the end of the feature, each position marked will reveal a prize ranging from 1x to 200x your wager."

The Scatter symbol, which depicts the knight, appears on all reels and pays out six free spins when six land in a single spin. Any position that held a Scatter that triggered the feature will be marked with a colored frame. The same will happen with all other Scatters that land during the Bonus game. At the end of the feature, each position marked will reveal a prize ranging from 1x to 200x your wager.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat is the volatility and RTP of the game?\n\nKnight Hot Spotz has high volatility and an RTP of 96.5%.\n\nHow many paylines does it have?\n\nThe game has 25 fixed paylines.\n\nCan I play Knight Hot Spotz on my tablet?\n\nYes, as it is an HTML5 game, it is compatible with any device, whether mobile or desktop.\n            ",
