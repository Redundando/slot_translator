It features a wild symbol that can replace all symbols, except for money symbols and scatters, to help players form winning combinations. Players can trigger the free spin feature by finding money symbols, and the bonus round can also be purchased. The game has an RTP of 96.51% and high volatility, offering infrequent but high-value rewards.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols in Black Bull include the eponymous black bull, as well as wolves, eagles, geckos, and classic playing cards. The wild symbol can replace all symbols except for money symbols and scatters. Money symbols have a value ranging from 0.5x to 50x, and the scatters can trigger the free spin feature.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nWith a winning potential of up to 4,500 times the player's bet, Black Bull offers high-value rewards that are not so frequent due to its high volatility. In the base game, players can win from 4 to 25 times their bet with 5 equal symbols on a payline. The free spin feature can be activated by finding money symbols, and the number of free spins awarded depends on the number of money symbols found.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nBlack Bull has an RTP of 96.51%, which is quite in line with the market average. It also has high volatility, meaning that players can expect infrequent but high-value rewards. The bonus round can be purchased in-game, which increases the RTP and offers players a chance to challenge their luck for big hits.\n\nBonus Features\n\nBlack Bull features a free spin feature that can be triggered by finding money symbols. The number of free spins awarded depends on the number of money symbols found, with a maximum of 10 free spins for finding 18 to 20 coin icons. Additionally, players can purchase the bonus round for a higher RTP rate and more chances of winning big. The bonus round also offers a different mechanism than the base game, adding more excitement to the gameplay.\n\n        \n            ",
