The game has a classic theme with a modern twist that appeals to fruit slot enthusiasts. It has 5 reels, 20 paylines, and bets start from €0.20 up to €20.00 per round. Hot Spin has a medium-to-high variance with a maximum win of 500 times your bet available on every spin or free spin. The RTP is 96%.\n\nSymbols in Hot Spin\n\nThe symbols in Hot Spin include Cherry, Lemon, Plum, Watermelon, Bell, Star, Lucky 7, and Diamond. The Cherry, Lemon, and Plum icons pay up to 2.5 times the bet per payline while Watermelon and Bell symbols pay up to 5 and 10 times the bet respectively. The Star and the lucky 7 award up to 15 times the stake. The highest-paying standard symbol is the Diamond, which pays a bet of 25 times if 5 identical symbols land on a payline. The Wild symbol, W, can offer prizes up to 25 times the bet and replaces all other symbols except the Bonus.\n\nBonus Wheels in Hot Spin\n\nHot Spin's most unique feature is the Bonus Wheel. You trigger the wheel by landing the Bonus symbol on reels 1, 3, and 5 in the same spin. The wheel assigns from 1 to 15 free spins, and you receive one of six bonus features during your free spins, including mystery symbols, random wilds, wild reels, winning spins, mega reel and sync reels up to 5 reels.\n\nFree Spins in Hot Spin\n\nThe Hot Spin slot game offers free spins as part of the Bonus Wheel feature. You can receive between 1 to 15 free spins. During free spins, you can trigger one of six bonus features, including mystery symbols, random wilds, wild reels, winning spins, mega reel and sync reels that can synchronize up to five reels. These features increase your chances of winning and add excitement to the game.\n\nVariance of Hot Spin\n\nThe Hot Spin slot game has medium-to-high variance, which means that players can expect big wins but with less frequency. Players can win up to 500 times their bet on every spin or free spin if they fill the reels with the Wild symbol. The game's RTP is 96%, which is a standard payout percentage for iSoftBet slot games.\n\n        \n            ",

The game has a classic design, but with modern elements, making it suitable for both classic and modern fruit slot players.\n\nHot Spin Bonus Wheel\n\nThe most exclusive feature of Hot Spin is the Bonus Wheel functionality which is triggered by landing the Bonus symbol on reels 1, 3, and 5 in the same spin. The Bonus Wheel assigns from 1 to 15 free spins and one of the following extra features: Mystery Symbols, Random Wilds, Wild Reels, Winning Spins, Mega Reel, or Sync Reels up to 5 reels, which leads to additional wins. The Bonus Wheel is the real attraction of this game.\n\nHot Spin Symbols and Paylines\n\nHot Spin has a variety of symbols that include Cherry, Lemon, Plum, Watermelon, Bell, Star, lucky 7, and Diamond. The payline starts from reel 1, and you need matching symbols on adjacent reels to form a winning combination. Cherry, Lemon, and Plum icons pay up to 2.5 times the bet per payline, followed by Watermelon and Bell symbols that pay up to 5 and 10 times the bet respectively. The Star and the lucky 7 award up to 15 times the stake. The highest-paying standard symbol is the Diamond which pays a bet of 25 times if 5 identical symbols land on a payline. The W is the Wild symbol that offers prizes up to 25 times the bet and replaces all other symbols except the Bonus.\n\nHot Spin Betting Options\n\nHot Spin has a betting range from €0.20 up to €20.00 per round. Players can adjust their bet using the +/- buttons at the bottom of the screen. The betting range is suitable for both high and low rollers. Players can also use the Autoplay feature to select a set number of spins to play automatically.\n\nHot Spin RTP and Variance\n\nHot Spin has a medium-to-high variance and a maximum win of 500 times your bet available on every spin or free spin. The RTP is 96%, which is a decent number compared to other online slot games. Players can expect to win decent amounts with the combination of the Bonus Wheel and free spins.\n\n        \n            ",

The classic design is revisited in a modern way to meet the needs of passionate fruit slot players. What are the distinctive elements of this slot without registration available in our best online casinos?\nHot Spin Slot Structure without Downloading\nThe gameplay consists of 5 reels and 20 paylines with bets starting from €0.20 up to €20.00 per round. The most exclusive feature of this game is the Bonus Wheel extra functionality, which will give you very special free spins. Regarding variance, Hot Spin has a medium-to-high variance with a maximum win of 500 times your bet available on every spin or free spin: you will win this amount if you fill the reels with the Wild symbol. The RTP is 96%.\nNow let's move on to the main symbols:\n\nLike any respectable fruit slot game, Hot Spin also has Cherry, Lemon, and Plum icons that pay up to 2.5 times the bet per payline, followed by Watermelon and Bell symbols that pay up to 5 and 10 times the bet respectively. Next, there is the Star and the lucky 7, which award up to 15 times the stake;\nThe highest-paying standard symbol is the Diamond, which pays a bet of 25 times if 5 identical symbols land on a payline;\nW is the Wild. It can offer prizes up to 25 times the bet and replaces all other symbols except the Bonus. You can form winning combinations with matching symbols on adjacent reels starting from reel 1.\n\nExtra feature: Hot Wheel\nTry to land the Bonus symbol on reels 1, 3, and 5 in the same spin to trigger the Hot Wheel feature. What is it? The wheel above the reels will spin and assign from 1 to 15 free spins. You will also receive 1 of the following extra features during your free spins:\n\nMystery Symbols - 6 or 8 symbols will transform into the same corresponding mystery symbol on every free spin,\nRandom Wilds - 5, 7, or 10 extra Wild symbols will be added to the reels on every free spin,\nWild Reels - stacked Wild reels are added and remain in play for the entire round,\nWinning Spins: each of your free spins guarantees a winner,\nMega Reel: during Hot Spins, reels 1, 2, and 3 or reels 2, 3, and 4 will fill up with crazy symbols,\nSync Reels up to 5 reels - a synchronization of the same symbol is created, leading to additional wins…\n\nFinal verdict: a combination of classic and modern elements\nI really enjoyed playing the free slot game Hot Spin. Clear visual effects and a well-crafted design provide the backdrop for the real attraction of this machine, which is, of course, the Hot Wheel. Don't think it's so easy to trigger, but once activated and with the help of free spins, you will get succulent wins.\n        ",
