The background that frames the game grid is simply the plain immersed in the night and the base on which the various symbols move recalls the desert sand.\n\nSpeaking of symbols, we find the various typical animals of the place (snakes, lizards, foxes, owls...) represented with a realistic style and accompanied by the suits of playing cards (flowers, coins, spades and hearts) which show bright but not brilliant colors, which perfectly match the mild style of the slot.\n\nEven from an audio point of view, Buffalo Spirit from WMS demonstrates an enviable calmness: there is no music playing in the background of the game, only a slight tune when we spin the reels.\n\nBuffalo Spirit: How to play\n\nWhat we have in front of us is a fairly traditional slot: five reels that rotate on themselves showing three symbols for each spin, with an RTP of 95.97% and thirty paylines along which the various combinations are calculated.\n\nSpeaking of winnings, there are three symbols associated with special functions in the game. The two buffaloes, distinguished from each other by the frame, are both Wild symbols, that is, they can count as wildcards by substituting for all other normal symbols.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by a buffalo framed by a green line and appears on all reels except the center one, whose place is occupied by the Buffalo symbol (the other Wild symbol). When finding this latter symbol, the expansion mode can be triggered: during this function, some symbols on the grid will be transformed into a single symbol, allowing for bigger wins.\n\nWe also find the Feature symbol, represented by a typically American rocky pile, which allows access to the bonus mode. This will be triggered by finding at least three of them in a single spin and in any position, as it is a Scatter symbol.\n\nThe gameplay of Buffalo Spirit is also influenced by the calm and serenity that one can breathe in the first impact with this game, making the slot the ideal title for those who want to have fun without additional stress.\n\nSlots Similar to Buffalo Spirit\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the bison (buffalo in English) is not as unusual as an animal in the world of online slots, so it is possible to find it repeatedly in various titles, such as Megaways Buffalo Rising by Blueprint Gaming, or still Buffalo Blitz by Playtech.\n            ",

The slot is inspired by the American bison, which is often associated with strength and tenacity in the world of online slots.\n\nTheme of American bison\n\nThe American bison is a symbol of wealth and was considered sacred by native populations for the support it gave to their community. Buffalo Spirit aims to represent the gentle and calm side of the animal through its audio-visual presentation.\n\nGameplay features\n\nBuffalo Spirit is a traditional five-reel slot with thirty paylines and an RTP of 95.97%. The slot features two Wild symbols that can substitute for all other normal symbols, as well as a Bonus mode, which is triggered by finding three or more Scatter symbols in a single spin. During the Bonus mode, some symbols on the grid will transform into a single one, allowing for bigger wins.\n\nRTP (Return to Player)\n\nBuffalo Spirit has an RTP of 95.97%, which is average for an online slot game. This means that, in theory, the game returns 95.97% of the money wagered by players over a long period of time.\n\nComparison with other buffalo-themed slots\n\nThe American bison is a popular theme in the world of online slots, and there are several other options in addition to Buffalo Spirit. Some popular titles with a similar theme include Megaways Buffalo Rising by Blueprint Gaming and Buffalo Blitz by Playtech. However, Buffalo Spirit stands out for its serene and calming atmosphere, making it an ideal choice for those who want to have fun without additional stress.\n\n        \n            ",

The game features a plain at night as its background and realistic representations of animals (like snakes, lizards, foxes, owls) and playing suits. There is no background music, only a slight tune when we spin the reels.\n\nGameplay and Specifications of Buffalo Spirit\n\nBuffalo Spirit is a traditional slot game that consists of five reels, three symbols per spin, and an RTP of 95.97%. This title has thirty paylines, and three symbols trigger special functions. The two buffaloes are both Wild symbols that work as wildcards, and the Feature symbol allows access to the bonus mode. The gameplay is relaxing, making it ideal for players who want to have fun without additional stress.\n\nWild Symbols and Bonus Mode of Buffalo Spirit\n\nBuffalo Spirit features two Wild symbols: a buffalo with a green frame, and the Buffalo symbol. The former can appear on all reels except the center one, while the latter appears on the center reel only. When three or more Feature symbols appear anywhere on the screen, the bonus mode is triggered, and players have the chance to get bigger wins while playing.\n\nComparison of Buffalo Spirit with Other Buffalo-Themed Slot Games\n\nThe American bison symbol is a popular motif for online slot games, and there are many titles like Blueprint Gaming's Megaways Buffalo Rising and Playtech's Buffalo Blitz that feature this animal. However, Buffalo Spirit differs from other bison-themed slots as it has a calming atmosphere, realistic representations of animals, and the gameplay is free from additional stress. Players can enjoy this traditional slot game without the need for complex rules, bonus features, and animation.\n\n        \n            ",

The background that frames the game grid is simply the plain immersed in the night and the base on which the various symbols move recalls the desert sand.\n\nSpeaking of symbols, we find the various typical animals of the place (snakes, lizards, foxes, owls...) represented with a realistic style and accompanied by the suits of playing cards (flowers, coins, spades and hearts) which show bright but not brilliant colors, which perfectly match the mild style of the slot.\n\nEven from an audio point of view, Buffalo Spirit from WMS demonstrates an enviable calmness: there is no music playing in the background of the game, only a slight tune when we spin the reels.\n\nBuffalo Spirit: How to play\n\nWhat we have in front of us is a fairly traditional slot: five reels that rotate on themselves showing three symbols for each spin, with an RTP of 95.97% and thirty paylines along which the various combinations are calculated.\n\nSpeaking of winnings, there are three symbols associated with special functions in the game. The two buffaloes, distinguished from each other by the frame, are both Wild symbols, that is, they can count as wildcards by substituting for all other normal symbols.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by a buffalo framed by a green line and appears on all reels except the center one, whose place is occupied by the Buffalo symbol (the other Wild symbol). When finding this latter symbol, the expansion mode can be triggered: during this function, some symbols on the grid will be transformed into a single symbol, allowing for bigger wins.\n\nWe also find the Feature symbol, represented by a typically American rocky pile, which allows access to the bonus mode. This will be triggered by finding at least three of them in a single spin and in any position, as it is a Scatter symbol.\n\nThe gameplay of Buffalo Spirit is also influenced by the calm and serenity that one can breathe in the first impact with this game, making the slot the ideal title for those who want to have fun without additional stress.\n\nSlots Similar to Buffalo Spirit\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the bison (buffalo in English) is not as unusual as an animal in the world of online slots, so it is possible to find it repeatedly in various titles, such as Megaways Buffalo Rising by Blueprint Gaming, or still Buffalo Blitz by Playtech.\n        ",
