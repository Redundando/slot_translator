Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay features\nBetting options\nReturn rate\nHighest paying symbol\nSimilar games\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Dr Fortuno\n\nWitness what Dr Fortuno has hidden inside his magical hat when playing this 20-payline Yggdrasil slot game with five reels. Play for a chance to win up to 8000x on this medium variance slot with a 96.20% player return rate. The game features a free spin feature and the Wheel of Fortune, which could also grant stacked symbols and multipliers on a minimum 0.005£ coin bet and a maximum 5.00£ per line bet.\n\nA Magical Graphic\n\nYggdrasil Gaming has been quite active recently and has developed several rather exciting new editions, and their new Dr Fortuno slot game is a circus-inspired slot with a lot to offer. It includes several interesting and funny features that are worth examining. In this review, we will provide you with all the important details regarding this game. Stay tuned and keep reading!\n\nThe theme is circus-oriented and includes well-developed graphic and design features, as we are used to from Yggdrasil Gaming. Also, the game's RTP is at 96.2%, making it a top-paying game above average. Lots to see regarding the Dr Fortuno slots.\n\nDr Fortuno has 5 reels and 20 paylines, giving you more than enough chances to win. The minimum amount that can be bet in the game starts at just £0.10 and can go up to £100.00. This means that the minimum line bet is £0.005. This only supports the fact that the reviewed online slot game is more than suitable for every type of player.\n\nAlthough when playing Dr Fortuno slots for the first time, you might think that the prices are relatively low, this slot can still reward you with a baseline prize of x800, but if you are particularly lucky, it could provide you with an amazing jackpot prize of £80,000, making the slot more impressive than ever. This means that the slot volatility is not high and is described as medium.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nBonus features in every slot game offer you additional opportunities to win and give you more fun and excitement.\n\nSo, in this game, you have Dr Fortuno, who acts as a wild symbol, replacing all symbols except scatters. When it appears on the reels within a winning combination, it pushes and covers the entire reel and triggers the Wheel of Fortune feature. From this, 5 spins on the wheel could be triggered, one for each Dr Fortuno appearing on the reels.\n\nSpinning the wheel will bring you some of the following prizes: the jackpot, cash prize 5x your bet, 2 extra spins on the wheel and a x5 multiplier of the total spin.\n\nIf the wheel stops at Jackpot Chance, the Jackpot segment is unlocked, and if the wheel stops at the unlocked field, you will win the progressive jackpot.\n\nAdditionally, this online slot game includes a Free Spins feature, which is activated if you can land 3 or more scatter symbols on any reel. For 3 landed scatter symbols, you will receive 10 free spins and all low-value symbols will be removed.\n\nYggdrasil Gaming is popular for the development of straightforward and easy-to-use slots, and this tradition continues with its new game Dr Fortuno.\n\nThe symbols in this online slot have 4 different colored potion bottles and Dr Fortuno's misfit troupe. The symbol of the Night Twins is the highest paying symbol in the game, providing up to x20 your bet.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nAs you may have understood, Dr Fortuno, the slot machine produced by Yggdrasil, has a magician as its main character, capable of bringing out incredible bonuses from his hat. If you like this type of plot, we can also recommend betting your money on Magic Wilds, the slot produced by Red Rake Gaming, which features a similar theme.\n            ",

Play for a chance to win up to 8000x on this medium variance slot with a 96.20% player return rate. The game features a free spin feature and the Wheel of Fortune, which could also grant stacked symbols and multipliers on a minimum 0.005£ coin bet and a maximum 5.00£ per line bet.\n\nA Magical Graphic\n\nYggdrasil Gaming has been quite active recently and has developed several rather exciting new editions, and their new Dr Fortuno slot game is a circus-inspired slot with a lot to offer. It includes several interesting and funny features that are worth examining. In this review, we will provide you with all the important details regarding this game. Stay tuned and keep reading!\n\nThe theme is circus-oriented and includes well-developed graphic and design features, as we are used to from Yggdrasil Gaming. Also, the game's RTP is at 96.2%, making it a top-paying game above average. Lots to see regarding the Dr Fortuno slots.\n\nDr Fortuno has 5 reels and 20 paylines, giving you more than enough chances to win. The minimum amount that can be bet in the game starts at just £0.10 and can go up to £100.00. This means that the minimum line bet is £0.005. This only supports the fact that the reviewed online slot game is more than suitable for every type of player.\n\nAlthough when playing Dr Fortuno slots for the first time, you might think that the prices are relatively low, this slot can still reward you with a baseline prize of x800, but if you are particularly lucky, it could provide you with an amazing jackpot prize of £80,000, making the slot more impressive than ever. This means that the slot volatility is not high and is described as medium.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nBonus features in every slot game offer you additional opportunities to win and give you more fun and excitement.\n\nSo, in this game, you have Dr Fortuno, who acts as a wild symbol, replacing all symbols except scatters. When it appears on the reels within a winning combination, it pushes and covers the entire reel and triggers the Wheel of Fortune feature. From this, 5 spins on the wheel could be triggered, one for each Dr Fortuno appearing on the reels.\n\nSpinning the wheel will bring you some of the following prizes: the jackpot, cash prize 5x your bet, 2 extra spins on the wheel and a x5 multiplier of the total spin.\n\nIf the wheel stops at Jackpot Chance, the Jackpot segment is unlocked, and if the wheel stops at the unlocked field, you will win the progressive jackpot.\n\nAdditionally, this online slot game includes a Free Spins feature, which is activated if you can land 3 or more scatter symbols on any reel. For 3 landed scatter symbols, you will receive 10 free spins and all low-value symbols will be removed.\n\nYggdrasil Gaming is popular for the development of straightforward and easy-to-use slots, and this tradition continues with its new game Dr Fortuno.\n\nThe symbols in this online slot have 4 different colored potion bottles and Dr Fortuno's misfit troupe. The symbol of the Night Twins is the highest paying symbol in the game, providing up to x20 your bet.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nAs you may have understood, Dr Fortuno, the slot machine produced by Yggdrasil, has a magician as its main character, capable of bringing out incredible bonuses from his hat. If you like this type of plot, we can also recommend betting your money on Magic Wilds, the slot produced by Red Rake Gaming, which features a similar theme.\n            ",

Play for a chance to win up to 8000x on this medium variance slot with a 96.20% player return rate. The game features a free spin feature and the Wheel of Fortune, which could also grant stacked symbols and multipliers on a minimum 0.005£ coin bet and a maximum 5.00£ per line bet.\n\nA Magical Graphic\n\nYggdrasil Gaming has been quite active recently and has developed several rather exciting new editions, and their new Dr Fortuno slot game is a circus-inspired slot with a lot to offer. It includes several interesting and funny features that are worth examining. In this review, we will provide you with all the important details regarding this game. Stay tuned and keep reading!\n\nThe theme is circus-oriented and includes well-developed graphic and design features, as we are used to from Yggdrasil Gaming. Also, the game's RTP is at 96.2%, making it a top-paying game above average. Lots to see regarding the Dr Fortuno slots.\n\nDr Fortuno has 5 reels and 20 paylines, giving you more than enough chances to win. The minimum amount that can be bet in the game starts at just £0.10 and can go up to £100.00. This means that the minimum line bet is £0.005. This only supports the fact that the reviewed online slot game is more than suitable for every type of player.\n\nAlthough when playing Dr Fortuno slots for the first time, you might think that the prices are relatively low, this slot can still reward you with a baseline prize of x800, but if you are particularly lucky, it could provide you with an amazing jackpot prize of £80,000, making the slot more impressive than ever. This means that the slot volatility is not high and is described as medium.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nBonus features in every slot game offer you additional opportunities to win and give you more fun and excitement.\n\nSo, in this game, you have Dr Fortuno, who acts as a wild symbol, replacing all symbols except scatters. When it appears on the reels within a winning combination, it pushes and covers the entire reel and triggers the Wheel of Fortune feature. From this, 5 spins on the wheel could be triggered, one for each Dr Fortuno appearing on the reels.\n\nSpinning the wheel will bring you some of the following prizes: the jackpot, cash prize 5x your bet, 2 extra spins on the wheel and a x5 multiplier of the total spin.\n\nIf the wheel stops at Jackpot Chance, the Jackpot segment is unlocked, and if the wheel stops at the unlocked field, you will win the progressive jackpot.\n\nAdditionally, this online slot game includes a Free Spins feature, which is activated if you can land 3 or more scatter symbols on any reel. For 3 landed scatter symbols, you will receive 10 free spins and all low-value symbols will be removed.\n\nYggdrasil Gaming is popular for the development of straightforward and easy-to-use slots, and this tradition continues with its new game Dr Fortuno.\n\nThe symbols in this online slot have 4 different colored potion bottles and Dr Fortuno's misfit troupe. The symbol of the Night Twins is the highest paying symbol in the game, providing up to x20 your bet.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nAs you may have understood, Dr Fortuno, the slot machine produced by Yggdrasil, has a magician as its main character, capable of bringing out incredible bonuses from his hat. If you like this type of plot, we can also recommend betting your money on Magic Wilds, the slot produced by Red Rake Gaming, which features a similar theme.\n            ",
