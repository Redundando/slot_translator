Come spesso accade nelle slot machine di casa Tom Horn, anche in Monster Madness sono presenti tre rulli anziché i classici cinque, e le linee di pagamento sono solamente otto. Tuttavia la presenza di simboli Scatter, Wild, e la possibilità di ottenere tanti giri gratuiti rendono il gioco nel complesso abbastanza articolato e divertente.\nI mostri che abitano questa cittadina del futuro hanno un aspetto molto amichevole e sono ben disegnati, come del resto anche lo sfondo: la grafica di questa slot sebbene non abbia animazioni 3D o particolari effetti speciali risulta nel complesso molto ben curata e gradevole, per un’esperienza di gioco sicuramente coinvolgente a accattivante.\nSimboli e modalità di gioco\nA fare da sfondo ai rulli troviamo un’ipotetica città del futuro caratterizzata da edifici alti e un cielo fumoso: in questo ambiente si muovono dei simpatici mostri che sembrano appena arrivati sulla terra da un pianeta alieno. I mostri si differenziano tra loro per aspetto e colore e hanno valori diversi quando determinano una combinazione vincente: il mostro arancione per esempio paga fino a 24 volte la puntata se compare su tutti e tre i rulli, il mostro con un occhio rosso e uno rosa ha un valore di soli 12, quello rosa si ferma a sei mentre il piccolo mostro blu con un occhio solo paga appena tre volte la puntata, ma solo se compare su tutti i rulli.\nIl valore della puntata molto basso rende la slot adatta a chi cerca il divertimento piuttosto che la possibilità di ottenere della vincite sostanziose.\nIn ogni caso, è possibile stabilire il valore della puntata su ogni singola linea, inoltre dopo aver settato il gioco si può anche giocare in modalità automatica grazie alla funzione Autoplay.\nSimboli Wild e Scatter\nIl simbolo Wild di Monster Madness è rappresentato da una sorta di coccarda all’interno della quale troviamo la scritta “Wild”. Come sempre, questo simbolo può sostituire tutti gli altri, tranne lo Scatter, nella realizzazione di una combinazione vincente. Oltre a questo, se compare su tutti i tre rulli paga una vincita pari a ben 60 volte la puntata.\nIl simbolo Scatter, rappresentato da un occhio verde, permette di ottenere diversi giri gratuiti!\nConclusioni\nMonster Madness è una slot molto divertente che seppur caratterizzata da un gameplay semplice e da vincite non troppo sostanziose in virtù di una bassa volatilità, garantisce tante piccole vincite molto frequenti. Il divertimento ci guadagna senz’altro, ma se cercate un gioco con cui portare a casa grosse somme, be’, forse è meglio sceglierne un altro!\n",

These monsters have different appearances and colours and hold different values for a winning combination. For instance, the orange monster pays up to 24 times the wager if it appears on all three reels, while the monster with a red and pink eye has a value of only 12, and the pink one stops at six.

The monsters are living on earth and rock the screen, adding more fun to the game. As is typical of Tom Horn slots, there are three reels instead of the classic five, and only eight paylines. However, the presence of scatter and wild symbols, as well as the potential to get many free spins, make for a complex and fun game overall.\nThe monsters that inhabit this futuristic town have a friendly appearance and are well-designed, as is the background. Although the graphics of this slot lack 3D animations or unique special effects, the game is very well-crafted and appealing for a captivating gaming experience.\nSymbols and Game Modes\nThe reels are set against an imaginary futuristic city with tall buildings and a smoky sky, where cute monsters can be seen moving about. These monsters have different appearances and colours and hold different values for a winning combination. For instance, the orange monster pays up to 24 times the wager if it appears on all three reels, while the monster with a red and pink eye has a value of only 12, and the pink one stops at six. The little blue monster with one eye, on the other hand, pays only three times the wager, but only when it appears on all the reels.\nThe very low value of the wagering requirement makes this slot suitable for those who seek entertainment rather than the possibility of obtaining substantial earnings. However, the value of the bet can be established for each line, and the Autoplay feature allows the player to play automatically after setting the game.\nWild and Scatter Symbols\nThe Wild symbol in Monster Madness is represented by a sort of badge with the word \"Wild\" inside it. This symbol substitutes for all others except the Scatter to complete a winning combination. Additionally, if it appears on all three reels, it pays a win equal to 60 times the wager.\nThe Scatter symbol, represented by a green eye, allows the player to obtain several free spins!\nConclusions\nMonster Madness is an extremely amusing slot machine that offers small but regular wins, thanks to its simple gameplay and low volatility. The game is sure to provide players with lots of fun, but if you're looking for a game in which you can win big, it might be better to select a different one!\n            ",

The low betting requirement makes it an affordable game for people who seek entertainment rather than large winnings. It has a Wild symbol which replaces all the other symbols except the Scatter.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols of Monster Madness are monsters of different colours with different values. The orange monster has the highest value, going up to 24 times the wager if it appears on all three reels, while the little blue monster has the lowest value, paying only three times the stake even if it is present on all the reels.\n\nPayouts\n\nThe payouts of Monster Madness are quite small but regular. The maximum payout that a player can get is 60 times the stake. This slot is suitable for players who are looking for smaller wins and a fun experience rather than high payouts.\n\nAutoplay\n\nMonster Madness has an Autoplay option which allows players to play automatically after setting the game. This feature is very helpful for those who do not want to click the Spin button each time the reels have stopped rolling.\n\nDesign\n\nThe game is set in a futuristic town with tall buildings and a smoky sky. The monsters are well-designed and give the game an amusing air. The graphics in Monster Madness lack 3D animations or unique special effects, but the game is well-crafted and appealing nonetheless.\n\n        \n            ",

The monsters are living on earth and rock the screen, adding more fun to the game. As is typical of Tom Horn slots, there are three reels instead of the classic five, and only eight paylines. However, the presence of scatter and wild symbols, as well as the potential to get many free spins, make for a complex and fun game overall.\nThe monsters that inhabit this futuristic town have a friendly appearance and are well-designed, as is the background. Although the graphics of this slot lack 3D animations or unique special effects, the game is very well-crafted and appealing for a captivating gaming experience.\nSymbols and Game Modes\nThe reels are set against an imaginary futuristic city with tall buildings and a smoky sky, where cute monsters can be seen moving about. These monsters have different appearances and colours and hold different values for a winning combination. For instance, the orange monster pays up to 24 times the wager if it appears on all three reels, while the monster with a red and pink eye has a value of only 12, and the pink one stops at six. The little blue monster with one eye, on the other hand, pays only three times the wager, but only when it appears on all the reels.\nThe very low value of the wagering requirement makes this slot suitable for those who seek entertainment rather than the possibility of obtaining substantial earnings. However, the value of the bet can be established for each line, and the Autoplay feature allows the player to play automatically after setting the game.\nWild and Scatter Symbols\nThe Wild symbol in Monster Madness is represented by a sort of badge with the word \"Wild\" inside it. This symbol substitutes for all others except the Scatter to complete a winning combination. Additionally, if it appears on all three reels, it pays a win equal to 60 times the wager.\nThe Scatter symbol, represented by a green eye, allows the player to obtain several free spins!\nConclusions\nMonster Madness is an extremely amusing slot machine that offers small but regular wins, thanks to its simple gameplay and low volatility. The game is sure to provide players with lots of fun, but if you're looking for a game in which you can win big, it might be better to select a different one!\n            ",
