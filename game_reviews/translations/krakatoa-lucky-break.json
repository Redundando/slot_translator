Each Scatter obtained allows you to get a free spin, which means a round where you don't have to use your game credit.\n\nFor the bonus symbols, getting six in a row will activate the bonus feature, giving you a 200x multiplier or one of the various jackpots listed above the slot machine's grid. The jackpots, from left to right, range from major to minor. The minor jackpot usually amounts to about 30 game credits and is called MINI, while the major, known as GRAND, offers around 15,000 game credits.\n\nThe volatility is high, so the wins are frequent, but the big ones, such as the jackpots, are truly difficult to hit.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf you like the volcano eruption genre, you absolutely must try Volatile Slot from Williams Interactive.

The game features electrifying graphics and a vintage look with vivid colors. The slot machine has symbols related to volcanic eruptions, adding to the theme's allure.\n\nOther volcano-themed slots\n\nIf you enjoy the volcano eruption theme, two great slot machines to try are Volatile Slot from Williams Interactive and Volcano Eruption from NextGen. Volatile Slot features more modern graphics, but it does not offer large jackpots like Krakatoa Lucky Break. On the other hand, Volcano Eruption has 25 paylines.\n\n        \n            ",

The volcano's 1883 eruption, which destroyed the island and spread ash around the world, inspired the game's background, which features lava, fire, and flames and creates a vintage look with vivid colors. The slot has a 5×3 grid and features symbols related to volcanic eruptions, as well as classic letters. The slot machine has 30 paylines, and its payout percentage is around 96.5%, which is higher than the average for other slots on the market.\n\nBonus Feature and Jackpots\n\nGetting six bonus symbols in a row will activate the bonus feature, giving you a 200x multiplier or one of the various jackpots. The jackpots range from major to minor, with the minor jackpot usually amounting to about 30 game credits and the major jackpot offering around 15,000 game credits. Above the grid are all the jackpots listed from left to right. The scatter symbol allows you to get a free spin for each Scatter obtained.\n\nGameplay and Volatility\n\nKrakatoa Lucky Break's 5×3 grid has 30 paylines that offer frequent wins, but the big ones, such as the jackpots, are truly difficult to hit. The slot machine has high volatility, so be prepared for a bumpy ride. If you're not sure about the high volatility, try playing the game first in the demo version to get a feel for how much to bet and when to expect a win.\n\nPayout Percentage\n\nKrakatoa Lucky Break offers a payout percentage of around 96.5%. This is higher than the average for other slots on the market. The payout percentage means that for every $100 you bet, you can expect to receive $96.50 back in winnings. The higher the payout percentage, the better your chances of winning.\n\nOther Volcano-Themed Slot Options\n\nIf you like volcano-themed slots, there are several other options you might want to try. Volatile Slot from Williams Interactive features more modern graphics than Krakatoa's vintage style and has a similar theme. However, the game does not offer large jackpots like in Krakatoa Lucky Break. Another great slot machine is Volcano Eruption from NextGen, with its 25 paylines and volcano eruption symbols.\n\n        \n            ",

Read on to learn all the details!\n\nElectrifying graphics\n\nKrakatoa, the slot machine from Ainsworth, is based on the volcano of the same name, located in Indonesia, which occasionally treats the world to a spectacular eruption. The game is certainly inspired by the 1883 eruption, which completely destroyed the island and spread dust and ash around the world. \n\nFor this reason, the slot's background features lava, fire, and flames, creating a vintage look with vivid colors. The slot machine has a 5×3 grid and, in addition to the classic letters J, Q, K, and Ace, features symbols related to volcanic eruptions, perfectly designed with attractive colors.\n\nAbove the grid are all the jackpots that can be won, ranging from major to minor from left to right.\n\nFunctions and Jackpots\n\nKrakatoa's 5×3 grid has 30 paylines, and if it seems like too few, you should know that this slot machine's payout is around 96.5%, a higher percentage than the average for other slots on the market.\n\nIn terms of the Scatter symbol, the function is very simple and immediate. Each Scatter obtained allows you to get a free spin, which means a round where you don't have to use your game credit.\n\nFor the bonus symbols, getting six in a row will activate the bonus feature, giving you a 200x multiplier or one of the various jackpots listed above the slot machine's grid.

The graphics are more modern than Krakatoa's vintage style, but there are no large jackpots offered like in this slot machine.\n\nAnother great slot machine is Volcano Eruption from NextGen, with its 25 paylines.\n            ",
