    "original_text": "\nFeline Fury\nLa nuova slot della Play’N’Go ci proietta in un villaggio del Medioevo insieme a quattro simpatici gatti che ci faranno divertire da matti!\nTema e grafica\nIn questa strabiliante slot ambientata in un villaggio medievale i protagonisti sono un gatto cavaliere, un gatto capitano, un gatto mercante e un gatto veggente. Per creare una simile slot la Play’N’Go ha dovuto mettere una particolare attenzione alla grafica, che infatti appare molto ben strutturata e ricca di dettagli. Sullo sfondo prossimo ammirare il villaggio con tanto di castello e la griglia di gioco rappresentata dal ponte levatoio. Nella parte bassa della griglia c’è tutto ciò che ci serve per settore al meglio la scommessa, oltre ai tasti per i giri automatici e quello Start. Una musica epica fa da sfondo al gioco, rendendo la partiate molto avvincente.\nSe siete curiosi di provare Feline Fury ma non volete spendere dei soldi veri, potrete giocare in maniera del tutto gratuita e senza necessità di registrazione, su tutte le principali piattaforme con licenza AAMS.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nLa griglia di gioco ha un taglio classico, 5 rulli e 3 righe, con la puntata minima pari a 0,20 €, caratteristica che la rende adatta anche per i giocatori occasionali. Per chi invece ama il rischio, la scommessa può raggiungere i 100 €. La vincita massima è di ben 5.000 € grazie alle 20 linee di gioco fisse, e può essere raggiunta anche grazie alla funzionalità Auto: dal tasto posto all’estrema sinistra si possono infatti impostare da un minimo di 10 sino a un massimo di 100 giri automatici, selezionando anche alcuni limiti di vincita o di perdita. Feline Fury ha un RTP (ritorno teorico al giocatore o return to player) piuttosto scarso, pari al 94,2% e una volatilità alta.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Feline Fury\nI simboli delle carte da gioco sono legati ai simboli principali: le picche di colore giallo al gatto cavaliere, i cuori sono rossi come il cappello del gatto mercante, i denari blu sono associati al gatto capitano e infine i fiori verdi al gatto veggente. Ciò vuol dire che simboli delle carte da gioco e gatti potranno essere associati per ottenere alcuni bonus. Le carte da gioco sono naturalmente i simboli che valgono meno, seguiti dai quattro gatti protagonisti della slot. Il simbolo Wild è la corona e oltre a sostituire tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter, offre anche vincite di discreto livello. Lo Scatter è la coppa dorata e assegna un minimo di 3 Free Spins. Se durante i giri gratuiti vengono raccolti 12 simboli di ciascun seme, vengono assegnati 3 giri extra e viene attivata la funzione Feline Wild per cui più gatti diventeranno Wild. Questa funzione, che può verificarsi anche casualmente durante i giri regolari dà inoltre vita al bonus Fury Reeds: alcuni dardi infuocati colpiscono i rulli e tutti i simboli Wild presenti andranno ad espandersi, incrementando così la possibilità di avere combinazioni vincenti. In base al numero dei Wilds verranno inoltre applicati dei moltiplicatori.\n",

Don't forget to hold on tight as Feline Fury offers high volatility, which means the winnings are well worth the risk.</p>\n\n    <p>While the RTP, or return to player percentage, is 94.2%, don't let it discourage you from playing. Remember, those big payouts are hiding just beneath the surface and waiting to pounce. Keep an eye out for the Wild Symbol, represented by the crown, that can substitute for any symbol except for the scatter. And speaking of the scatter, make sure you keep a lookout for the golden cup as it awards a minimum of three free spins.</p>\n\n    <p>But the fun doesn't stop there. You can play in demo mode to get a feel for the game or register on AAMS-licensed platforms to earn real money and start living like the King or Queen of the cats.</p>\n\n    <p>So what are you waiting for? Start spinning those reels and let the feline fury take control. Just remember to have some catnip on hand for all those kitty-tastic wins!</p>\"\n}"

The minimum bet is 0.20 €, while the maximum is 100 € per spin. The RTP is 94.2%, which is relatively low, but the game also offers high volatility. The Wild symbol is represented by the crown and can substitute for any symbol except for the scatter. The scatter, represented by the golden cup, awards at least three free spins. Play in demo mode or register on AAMS-licensed platforms to earn real money. \n\nSymbols and Bonuses\n\nThe playing card symbols are associated with the four main cat characters, with each suit linked to a specific bonus. The Wild symbol is represented by the crown and can substitute for any symbol except for the scatter, offering decent rewards. The scatter, represented by the golden cup, awards at least three free spins. If 12 symbols of each suit are collected during free spins, an additional 3 spins are awarded, while the Feline Wild function transforms more cats into Wild symbols. The Fury Reeds bonus feature comes alive when some fiery darts hit the reels, making all the Wild symbols expand and increasing the chances of a winning combination. The number of Wilds also determines the applicable multipliers, which significantly increase the prize pool. \n\nVolatility and Return to Player Percentage\n\nFeline Fury's RTP (return to player) of 94.2% is rather low, but it's offset by high volatility. The game offers the potential for high payouts, with a maximum of 5,000 € on the 20 fixed paylines. \n\nBetting Range\n\nFeline Fury offers a minimum bet of 0.20 €, which is comfortably within reach of casual players, while risk-takers can raise the stakes up to 100 € per spin. \n\nVisual Design and Theme\n\nFeline Fury features stunning visual design and a medieval village theme. The backdrop is a medieval village complete with a castle, while the game grid is represented by a drawbridge. The low-end game controls are situated at the bottom of the grid. The gameplay is made more thrilling by an epic soundtrack. \n\n        \n            ",

(4 bullet points)\n- Bullet lists briefly covering the topic \"What we don't like\". (2 bullet pints)\n- SEO optimized meta title with a maximum length of 45 characters. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics\n\nFeline Fury is a medieval-themed slot with 5 reels and 3 rows. It boasts a classic game grid and has 20 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is 0.20 € and the maximum is 100 € per spin. The game has a maximum payout of 5,000 €.\n\nWild and Scatter symbols\n\nThe Wild symbol in Feline Fury is represented by the crown, and can substitute for any symbol except the scatter. The Scatter symbol is represented by the golden cup and awards at least three free spins. During free spins, collecting 12 symbols of each suit awards an additional 3 spins, and the Feline Wild function transforms more cats into Wild symbols.\n\nBonus features\n\nFury Reels is the main bonus feature in Feline Fury. It is triggered randomly during the regular play mode when fiery darts hit the reels, causing all Wild symbols to expand and increasing the chances of a winning combination. The number of Wilds also determines the applicable multipliers, which can significantly increase the prize pool.\n\nBetting options\n\nFeline Fury has a minimum bet of 0.20 € - comfortably within reach of casual players. The maximum bet is 100 € per spin. Players can try the game in demo mode without spending real money, or register on any of the major AAMS-licensed platforms to earn real money.\n\nRTP and volatility\n\nFeline Fury has an RTP (return to player) of 94.2%, which is rather low. However, the game makes up for it with high volatility. This means that while players may experience long periods of play without winning, when they do hit a winning combination, the payout can be significant.\n\n        \n            ",

Add an epic soundtrack and the gameplay becomes even more thrilling.\n\nThe classic game grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with a minimum bet of 0.20 € - comfortably within reach of casual players. Risk-takers can raise the stakes up to 100 € per spin. The 20 fixed paylines boast a maximum payout of a jaw-dropping 5,000 €! Play in demo mode without spending real money, or register on any of the major AAMS-licensed platforms to earn real money.\n\nFeline Fury's RTP (return to player) of 94.2% is rather low, but it's offset by high volatility. The playing card symbols are associated with the four main cat characters, with each suit linked to a specific bonus. The Wild symbol is represented by the crown and can substitute for any symbol except for the scatter, offering decent rewards. The scatter, represented by the golden cup, awards at least three free spins. If 12 symbols of each suit are collected during free spins, an additional 3 spins are awarded, while the Feline Wild function transforms more cats into Wild symbols. Verifying casually during the regular play mode, Fury Reeds bonus feature comes alive when some fiery darts hit the reels, making all the Wild symbols expand, increasing the chances of a winning combination. The number of Wilds also determines the applicable multipliers, which significantly increase the prize pool. Try Feline Fury now and get ready for some cat-tastic entertainment!\n        ",

The Maya warrior should be standing in front of the medieval village backdrop with a castle and drawbridge. The warrior should be holding a golden cup in one hand and a fiery dart in the other, with a mischievous grin on their face. The four charming feline heroes should be standing around the warrior, each representing a playing card symbol and associated bonus. The image should convey a sense of adventure, excitement, and fun."
