Players can enjoy clean graphics and sound effects in a 5-reel, 10-pay line or 40-pay line format.\n\nSymbols and Pay Lines\n\nThe high-paying symbols in Golden Goddess include a pink horse, white duck, prince, brown horse, and the golden goddess herself. Standard playing card symbols are also featured. Pay lines run from left to right.\n\nSuper Stacks Feature\n\nThe Super Stacks feature is activated when players land three identical symbols in a vertical line. These symbols combine to form a giant symbol, which can result in impressive payouts.\n\nFree Spins Bonus\n\nPlayers can trigger the Free Spins bonus by landing the Red Rose bonus symbol on reels 2, 3, and 4. This symbol doesn't provide payouts but does allow players to earn up to 7 free spins if they align 9 bonus symbols in total.
