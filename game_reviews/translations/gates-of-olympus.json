You win with combinations of adjacent symbols anywhere on the game board, and can bet from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €125 per spin. \n\nAs for the RTP value, we are at 96.5% and the volatility is high, which means that you don't win often, but there are excellent chances of getting combinations that pay out very high winnings at the cost of having to make a few extra spins.\n\nSymbols and functionality\n\nA feature of Gates of Olympus is the cascade system: every time you have a winning combination, the paying symbols disappear, the upper symbols slide into the empty slots, and new symbols land from above to increase the chance of occupying additional paylines.

At this point, Zeus next to the board forks the lightning and throws it, determining a multiplier ranging from 2x to 500x. After the cascade sequence ends, the multipliers will be added together and all the relevant winnings will be multiplied.\n\nZeus is the Scatter symbol and pays out in every position. If four of them appear anywhere on the screen, you are entitled to 15 free spins during which multipliers may appear. Every time three or more Scatters appear, another 5 or more Free Spins are added.\n\nThe player can also buy two types of multiplier:\n\n25x, with a higher chance of winning free spins as more Scatters appear on the screen.\n\n20x, which allows you to buy the Free Spins feature by paying a value equal to 100x the bet.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is your RTP?\n\nIt has an excellent return to the player of 96.5%.\n\nCan I play on my phone?\n\nOf course, the slot is optimized to work perfectly on both PCs and phones without any loss of graphics or gameplay quality.\n\nWhat is the maximum payout of the Gates of Olympus slot?\n\nThis 6x5 slot has a potential payout of 5,000x the bet.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay Features\nSymbols and Functionality\nGame Theme\nWinning Potential\nRTP and Volatility Level\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Review of Gates of Olympus\n\nGates of Olympus is a beautiful slot game that uses the theme of mythology. It has all the ingredients to become a great classic of online entertainment. The protagonist of this slot is Zeus, the father of all the gods and guardian of Mount Olympus, hovering next to the game board. Occasionally, a clip will appear in his hands, signaling a special feature that we will discuss shortly.\n\nAt the bottom, we find the bets and the Start and Autoplay buttons. On the right, we find the option to buy free spins, but also an increase in the chances of getting winning combinations. There is also a box on the right that displays the winning combinations in a single spin.\n\nThe music has an epic flavor that can be quite engaging but can be turned off at any time through the appropriate button.\n\nFeatures of Gates of Olympus\n\nThe slot has 6 reels and 5 rows, with a maximum win of 5,000x the bet. You win with combinations of adjacent symbols anywhere on the game board, and can bet from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €125 per spin. \n\nAs for the RTP value, we are at 96.5% and the volatility is high, which means that you don't win often, but there are excellent chances of getting combinations that pay out very high winnings at the cost of having to make a few extra spins.\n\nSymbols and functionality\n\nA feature of Gates of Olympus is the cascade system: every time you have a winning combination, the paying symbols disappear, the upper symbols slide into the empty slots, and new symbols land from above to increase the chance of occupying additional paylines. The progressive combinations and associated amounts are displayed in the box next to the game board, and you win with 8 adjacent symbols anywhere on the reels.\n\nThe symbols that are worth the least are the geometric shapes. Let's see them from the least lucrative to the most lucrative: the first is the blue diamond, the second is the triangle, the third is the hexagon. Following these are a second triangle but with the vertex facing downwards, and a pentagon. \n\nMoving up, we have the thematic symbols: the cup, the ring, the hourglass, and the diadem.\n\nFrom time to time, and entirely randomly, a green, blue, pink, or red winged ball will appear. At this point, Zeus next to the board forks the lightning and throws it, determining a multiplier ranging from 2x to 500x. After the cascade sequence ends, the multipliers will be added together and all the relevant winnings will be multiplied.\n\nZeus is the Scatter symbol and pays out in every position. If four of them appear anywhere on the screen, you are entitled to 15 free spins during which multipliers may appear. Every time three or more Scatters appear, another 5 or more Free Spins are added.\n\nThe player can also buy two types of multiplier:\n\n25x, with a higher chance of winning free spins as more Scatters appear on the screen.\n\n20x, which allows you to buy the Free Spins feature by paying a value equal to 100x the bet.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is your RTP?\n\nIt has an excellent return to the player of 96.5%.\n\nCan I play on my phone?\n\nOf course, the slot is optimized to work perfectly on both PCs and phones without any loss of graphics or gameplay quality.\n\nWhat is the maximum payout of the Gates of Olympus slot?\n\nThis 6x5 slot has a potential payout of 5,000x the bet.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Features\n\nGates of Olympus is a 6-reel, 5-row slot game with a maximum win of 5,000x the bet. Winning combinations are formed by adjacent symbols anywhere on the game board, and the bet can be adjusted from €0.20 to €125 per spin. The game also features a cascade system in which paying symbols disappear, allowing new symbols to land and increase the chance of additional paylines. The game has an RTP value of 96.5%, and high volatility, meaning that while wins may be infrequent, payouts can be substantial.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\n\nSymbols in this Greek mythology themed slot range from geometric shapes, such as blue diamonds, triangles and pentagons, to thematic symbols like cups, rings, hourglasses and diadems. Cascade sequences can be triggered randomly by winged balls which come in green, blue, pink, or red colors. When this occurs, Zeus – the protagonist of the game – forks lightning, creating a multiplier ranging from 2x to 500x. The game's multiplier can be purchased in two ways; at a 20x value that enables buying the free spins feature by paying 100x the bet value, or a 25x value which increases the chances of winning free spins as scatter symbols appear on the screen. The Scatter symbol is represented by Zeus himself and pays out in every position. If four of them appear anywhere on the screen, 15 free spins are awarded, and more free spins can be won by landing additional Scatter symbols.\n\nTheme and Presentation\n\nGates of Olympus is an intriguing slot game that takes its theme from Greek mythology, with the god Zeus as its protagonist overseeing play from next to the game board. The game design and graphics are stunning, with a music score that adds cinematic quality to gameplay. The game's cascade system and winged ball multiplier features are closely tied to the theme of the game, adding to the immersive experience.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nThe game's high volatility may be discouraging at first, but it offers excellent winning potential, with a 5,000x maximum payout. The cascading reels system increases chances of winning multiple paylines in a single spin, and the game's multiplier can add up fast to enhance payouts even further. The chance to win free spins and increasing the chance of landing more free spins increase the player's potential winnings.\n\nRTP and Volatility Level\n\nGates of Olympus boasts an RTP value of 96.5%, which is higher than the industry average. It also has high volatility, implying that while wins could be infrequent, they can be substantial and add up to a large sum. This combination adds excitement to gameplay, with the potential for large payouts being a significant draw, especially for experienced players.\n\n        \n            ",

The protagonist is Zeus, the father of all the gods and the guardian of Mount Olympus, hovering next to the game board. A feature of Gates of Olympus is the cascade system: every time you have a winning combination, the paying symbols disappear, the upper symbols slide into the empty slots, and new symbols land from above to increase the chance of occupying additional paylines. The slot has a maximum payout of 5,000x the bet.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\n\nThere are ten symbols in Gates of Olympus, consisting of geometric shapes, thematic symbols, and the Scatter symbol. The symbols that are worth the least are the geometric shapes, followed by the thematic symbols. The Scatter bonus symbol pays out in every position and can trigger free spins if four of them appear anywhere on the screen. Zeus, the father of all the gods and the guardian of Mount Olympus, is the Scatter symbol with the highest payout. The game also includes multipliers that can range from 2x to 500x, and when the cascade sequence ends, all relevant winnings will be multiplied by the sum of multipliers.\n\nGame Theme\n\nThe theme of Gates of Olympus is based on Greek mythology, and the protagonist is Zeus, the father of all the gods. The game board is situated next to Zeus, with occasional animations showing his presence.  The music has an epic flavor and engaging enough to fit the epic Greek theme and can be turned off at any time through the appropriate button.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nWith a maximum payout of 5,000x the bet, Gates of Olympus offers a great potential for players to win big. The slot has a high volatility level, meaning that winning combinations are not frequent, but there are excellent chances of getting combinations that pay out very high winnings after a few spins.\n\nRTP and Volatility Level\n\nGates of Olympus offers a good return to the player ratio of 96.5%. The game's high volatility level provides an excellent chance to land a winning combination that pays out very high winnings after a few extra spins. The slot is optimized to work perfectly on both PCs and mobile phones without any loss of graphics or gameplay quality.\n\n        \n            ",

It has all the ingredients to become a great classic of online entertainment. The protagonist of this slot is Zeus, the father of all the gods and guardian of Mount Olympus, hovering next to the game board. Occasionally, a clip will appear in his hands, signaling a special feature that we will discuss shortly.\n\nAt the bottom, we find the bets and the Start and Autoplay buttons. On the right, we find the option to buy free spins, but also an increase in the chances of getting winning combinations. There is also a box on the right that displays the winning combinations in a single spin.\n\nThe music has an epic flavor that can be quite engaging but can be turned off at any time through the appropriate button.\n\nFeatures of Gates of Olympus\n\nThe slot has 6 reels and 5 rows, with a maximum win of 5,000x the bet. You win with combinations of adjacent symbols anywhere on the game board, and can bet from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €125 per spin. \n\nAs for the RTP value, we are at 96.5% and the volatility is high, which means that you don't win often, but there are excellent chances of getting combinations that pay out very high winnings at the cost of having to make a few extra spins.\n\nSymbols and functionality\n\nA feature of Gates of Olympus is the cascade system: every time you have a winning combination, the paying symbols disappear, the upper symbols slide into the empty slots, and new symbols land from above to increase the chance of occupying additional paylines. The progressive combinations and associated amounts are displayed in the box next to the game board, and you win with 8 adjacent symbols anywhere on the reels.\n\nThe symbols that are worth the least are the geometric shapes. Let's see them from the least lucrative to the most lucrative: the first is the blue diamond, the second is the triangle, the third is the hexagon. Following these are a second triangle but with the vertex facing downwards, and a pentagon. \n\nMoving up, we have the thematic symbols: the cup, the ring, the hourglass, and the diadem.\n\nFrom time to time, and entirely randomly, a green, blue, pink, or red winged ball will appear. At this point, Zeus next to the board forks the lightning and throws it, determining a multiplier ranging from 2x to 500x. After the cascade sequence ends, the multipliers will be added together and all the relevant winnings will be multiplied.\n\nZeus is the Scatter symbol and pays out in every position. If four of them appear anywhere on the screen, you are entitled to 15 free spins during which multipliers may appear. Every time three or more Scatters appear, another 5 or more Free Spins are added.\n\nThe player can also buy two types of multiplier:\n\n25x, with a higher chance of winning free spins as more Scatters appear on the screen.\n\n20x, which allows you to buy the Free Spins feature by paying a value equal to 100x the bet.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is your RTP?\n\nIt has an excellent return to the player of 96.5%.\n\nCan I play on my phone?\n\nOf course, the slot is optimized to work perfectly on both PCs and phones without any loss of graphics or gameplay quality.\n\nWhat is the maximum payout of the Gates of Olympus slot?\n\nThis 6x5 slot has a potential payout of 5,000x the bet.\n            ",
