The symbols are typical of fruit-themed slot machines, but also include the word BONUS divided into three separate symbols. The high variability means there is potential for big wins.\n\nBlueprint has gone with a strange mix in Clone Bonus 7, with modern unique features but also some of the ugliest fruit-style graphics seen in recent years. Perhaps it is meant to be disruptive, and it certainly is, but it's not doing much to improve its appeal. The game has reminded me of Book of Ra, thanks to the way special symbols work.\n\nClone Bonus 7 has 3x3 reels and 5 lines, which is quite normal for an older game. What is unusual is the Clone Bonus feature, where symbols multiply, along with free spins where you can always take advantage.\n\nBlueprint Gaming has created some incredibly eye-catching games in terms of graphic design. With this game, however, it doesn't seem like they cared. Or did they? The symbols look like old fruit machine fruits, and yet the gameplay is smooth and packed with energy.\n\nThe Clone Bonus 7 slot offers some visual entertainment. Winning results are celebrated with flashing fruit symbols that stay in place. It's not much, but it's what classic fruit slots do. Apart from that, there isn't much to talk about in terms of graphic design. Instead of a musical theme, the game has analog sounds, completing the experience of playing a classic fruit slot on the casino floor.\n\nThe omnipresent green spin button is always there on the right-hand side of the reel. Press it once to spin the reels, which will deduct the active bet amount from the balance.\n\nTo change the bet, press the circular button on the left or the upward and downward pointing arrows. The first action opens a grid with bet amounts, and the other action browsing the available bets.\n\nThe amazing thing is that Clone Bonus 7 slot is not cheap. The five paylines will have some players thinking they can try the game for 5 cents per spin, but the reality is that the game costs 25 cents. The minimum bet starts the range of multiple amounts for bets, which ends with a maximum of €125.00 per spin.\n\nOne way to play this classic slot is to select the autoplay option. The button in the bottom right corner opens the menu where players can choose from preset automatic spins and add optional settings that can track spending controls.\n\nIn terms of extra features, the bonus offers more than just free spins. At the start of the bonus, a symbol is selected to reveal the special clone symbol that lasts during the bonus.\n\nThe bonus is called Clone Bonus and is triggered when the game matches the word BONUS on one of the paylines. Ten free spins are given during which the clone symbol can land on the reel and expand to cover its entirety. More than one clone symbol appearing on the reels on the same spin means a winning result is just waiting to happen.\n\nThe game's winning combination is matching three symbols on the reel. Of course, the five paylines mean there can be more than one payline win per spin. And there's also a wild symbol to help things along.\n\nIn terms of value, the star symbol pays the best amounts and is followed by the bell and double BAR symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines include Fire Joker, a classic Play N GO slot machine that will surely take you back in time when slot machines were simple yet brilliant. The slot game uses three reels and five paylines, which was once considered modern compared to single-payline slots at the beginning. The game can be played as soon as you find a casino on the right side of this article.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nClone Bonus feature\nGameplay and design\nWinning potential\nMinimum and maximum bets\nSimilar games\nMaximum multiplier\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Clone Bonus is a slot game with a layout of three reels, three rows, and five always-active paylines. The symbols are typical of fruit-themed slot machines, but also include the word BONUS divided into three separate symbols. The high variability means there is potential for big wins.\n\nBlueprint has gone with a strange mix in Clone Bonus 7, with modern unique features but also some of the ugliest fruit-style graphics seen in recent years. Perhaps it is meant to be disruptive, and it certainly is, but it's not doing much to improve its appeal. The game has reminded me of Book of Ra, thanks to the way special symbols work.\n\nClone Bonus 7 has 3x3 reels and 5 lines, which is quite normal for an older game. What is unusual is the Clone Bonus feature, where symbols multiply, along with free spins where you can always take advantage.\n\nBlueprint Gaming has created some incredibly eye-catching games in terms of graphic design. With this game, however, it doesn't seem like they cared. Or did they? The symbols look like old fruit machine fruits, and yet the gameplay is smooth and packed with energy.\n\nThe Clone Bonus 7 slot offers some visual entertainment. Winning results are celebrated with flashing fruit symbols that stay in place. It's not much, but it's what classic fruit slots do. Apart from that, there isn't much to talk about in terms of graphic design. Instead of a musical theme, the game has analog sounds, completing the experience of playing a classic fruit slot on the casino floor.\n\nThe omnipresent green spin button is always there on the right-hand side of the reel. Press it once to spin the reels, which will deduct the active bet amount from the balance.\n\nTo change the bet, press the circular button on the left or the upward and downward pointing arrows. The first action opens a grid with bet amounts, and the other action browsing the available bets.\n\nThe amazing thing is that Clone Bonus 7 slot is not cheap. The five paylines will have some players thinking they can try the game for 5 cents per spin, but the reality is that the game costs 25 cents. The minimum bet starts the range of multiple amounts for bets, which ends with a maximum of €125.00 per spin.\n\nOne way to play this classic slot is to select the autoplay option. The button in the bottom right corner opens the menu where players can choose from preset automatic spins and add optional settings that can track spending controls.\n\nIn terms of extra features, the bonus offers more than just free spins. At the start of the bonus, a symbol is selected to reveal the special clone symbol that lasts during the bonus.\n\nThe bonus is called Clone Bonus and is triggered when the game matches the word BONUS on one of the paylines. Ten free spins are given during which the clone symbol can land on the reel and expand to cover its entirety. More than one clone symbol appearing on the reels on the same spin means a winning result is just waiting to happen.\n\nThe game's winning combination is matching three symbols on the reel. Of course, the five paylines mean there can be more than one payline win per spin. And there's also a wild symbol to help things along.\n\nIn terms of value, the star symbol pays the best amounts and is followed by the bell and double BAR symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines include Fire Joker, a classic Play N GO slot machine that will surely take you back in time when slot machines were simple yet brilliant. The slot game uses three reels and five paylines, which was once considered modern compared to single-payline slots at the beginning. The game can be played as soon as you find a casino on the right side of this article. The denomination of the slot starts at 0.05 euro and goes up to 100.00 euro, where the maximum multiplier of the Fire Joker slot is x80.\n            ",

The symbols on the reels include fruit symbols and three separate symbols that spell the word BONUS. The game offers high variability, which means there are plenty of opportunities for big wins.\n\nClone Bonus Feature\n\nClone Bonus has a unique feature called the Clone Bonus feature. During this feature, symbols multiply, and players get ten free spins. Before the bonus starts, a symbol is selected to reveal the special clone symbol that lasts during the bonus. The clone symbol can expand to cover its entirety, and more than one clone symbol appearing on the reels on the same spin can lead to a winning result.\n\nGameplay\n\nPlayers can press the green spin button on the right-hand side of the reels to spin the reels. To change the bet, players can press the circular button on the left, which opens a grid with bet amounts, or the upward and downward-pointing arrows that browse the available bets. The game has an autoplay option that lets players choose from preset automatic spins and add optional settings that can track spending controls. The game pays out winning combinations when three symbols match on a payline, and there's also a wild symbol to help players achieve wins.\n\nGraphics\n\nClone Bonus's graphics feature fruit symbols similar to those in classic fruit slot machines. The graphics may not be as flashy as other online slot games, but the gameplay is smooth and packed with energy. Winning results are celebrated with flashing fruit symbols that remain on the screen. The game has a musical theme that complements the analog sounds to complete the experience of playing a classic fruit slot on the casino floor.\n\nBetting Options\n\nClone Bonus has a minimum bet of 25 cents, which may be higher than what some players expect considering the game has only five paylines. The betting range ends with a maximum of €125.00 per spin, allowing high rollers to place larger bets. Players can choose from a range of betting amounts by using the circular button on the left or the upward and downward-pointing arrows.\n\nSimilar Slot Games\n\nFire Joker is a classic Play N GO slot machine that uses three reels and five paylines. Like Clone Bonus, it offers a retro gaming experience that appeals to fans of classic fruit machines. The game's denomination starts at 0.05 euro and goes up to 100.00 euro, and the maximum multiplier is x80.\n\n        \n            ",

The winning combination entails matching three symbols on the reel, and there can be more than one payline win per spin, with the star symbol being the most valuable followed by the bell and double BAR symbols.\n\nMinimum and maximum bets\n\nThe minimum bet starts at 25 cents, which is the cost of the game with five paylines. The range of multiple amounts for bets ends with a maximum of €125.00 per spin.

Perhaps it is meant to be disruptive, and it certainly is, but it's not doing much to improve its appeal. The game has reminded me of Book of Ra, thanks to the way special symbols work.\n\nClone Bonus 7 has 3x3 reels and 5 lines, which is quite normal for an older game. What is unusual is the Clone Bonus feature, where symbols multiply, along with free spins where you can always take advantage.\n\nBlueprint Gaming has created some incredibly eye-catching games in terms of graphic design. With this game, however, it doesn't seem like they cared. Or did they? The symbols look like old fruit machine fruits, and yet the gameplay is smooth and packed with energy.\n\nThe Clone Bonus 7 slot offers some visual entertainment. Winning results are celebrated with flashing fruit symbols that stay in place. It's not much, but it's what classic fruit slots do. Apart from that, there isn't much to talk about in terms of graphic design. Instead of a musical theme, the game has analog sounds, completing the experience of playing a classic fruit slot on the casino floor.\n\nThe omnipresent green spin button is always there on the right-hand side of the reel. Press it once to spin the reels, which will deduct the active bet amount from the balance.\n\nTo change the bet, press the circular button on the left or the upward and downward pointing arrows. The first action opens a grid with bet amounts, and the other action browsing the available bets.\n\nThe amazing thing is that Clone Bonus 7 slot is not cheap. The five paylines will have some players thinking they can try the game for 5 cents per spin, but the reality is that the game costs 25 cents. The minimum bet starts the range of multiple amounts for bets, which ends with a maximum of €125.00 per spin.\n\nOne way to play this classic slot is to select the autoplay option. The button in the bottom right corner opens the menu where players can choose from preset automatic spins and add optional settings that can track spending controls.\n\nIn terms of extra features, the bonus offers more than just free spins. At the start of the bonus, a symbol is selected to reveal the special clone symbol that lasts during the bonus.\n\nThe bonus is called Clone Bonus and is triggered when the game matches the word BONUS on one of the paylines. Ten free spins are given during which the clone symbol can land on the reel and expand to cover its entirety. More than one clone symbol appearing on the reels on the same spin means a winning result is just waiting to happen.\n\nThe game's winning combination is matching three symbols on the reel. Of course, the five paylines mean there can be more than one payline win per spin. And there's also a wild symbol to help things along.\n\nIn terms of value, the star symbol pays the best amounts and is followed by the bell and double BAR symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines include Fire Joker, a classic Play N GO slot machine that will surely take you back in time when slot machines were simple yet brilliant. The slot game uses three reels and five paylines, which was once considered modern compared to single-payline slots at the beginning. The game can be played as soon as you find a casino on the right side of this article. The denomination of the slot starts at 0.05 euro and goes up to 100.00 euro, where the maximum multiplier of the Fire Joker slot is x80.\n            ",

The symbols are typical of fruit-themed slot machines, but also include the word BONUS divided into three separate symbols. The high variability means there is potential for big wins.\n\nBlueprint has gone with a strange mix in Clone Bonus 7, with modern unique features but also some of the ugliest fruit-style graphics seen in recent years. Perhaps it is meant to be disruptive, and it certainly is, but it's not doing much to improve its appeal. The game has reminded me of Book of Ra, thanks to the way special symbols work.\n\nClone Bonus 7 has 3x3 reels and 5 lines, which is quite normal for an older game. What is unusual is the Clone Bonus feature, where symbols multiply, along with free spins where you can always take advantage.\n\nBlueprint Gaming has created some incredibly eye-catching games in terms of graphic design. With this game, however, it doesn't seem like they cared. Or did they? The symbols look like old fruit machine fruits, and yet the gameplay is smooth and packed with energy.\n\nThe Clone Bonus 7 slot offers some visual entertainment. Winning results are celebrated with flashing fruit symbols that stay in place. It's not much, but it's what classic fruit slots do. Apart from that, there isn't much to talk about in terms of graphic design. Instead of a musical theme, the game has analog sounds, completing the experience of playing a classic fruit slot on the casino floor.\n\nThe omnipresent green spin button is always there on the right-hand side of the reel. Press it once to spin the reels, which will deduct the active bet amount from the balance.\n\nTo change the bet, press the circular button on the left or the upward and downward pointing arrows. The first action opens a grid with bet amounts, and the other action browsing the available bets.\n\nThe amazing thing is that Clone Bonus 7 slot is not cheap. The five paylines will have some players thinking they can try the game for 5 cents per spin, but the reality is that the game costs 25 cents. The minimum bet starts the range of multiple amounts for bets, which ends with a maximum of €125.00 per spin.\n\nOne way to play this classic slot is to select the autoplay option. The button in the bottom right corner opens the menu where players can choose from preset automatic spins and add optional settings that can track spending controls.\n\nIn terms of extra features, the bonus offers more than just free spins. At the start of the bonus, a symbol is selected to reveal the special clone symbol that lasts during the bonus.\n\nThe bonus is called Clone Bonus and is triggered when the game matches the word BONUS on one of the paylines. Ten free spins are given during which the clone symbol can land on the reel and expand to cover its entirety. More than one clone symbol appearing on the reels on the same spin means a winning result is just waiting to happen.\n\nThe game's winning combination is matching three symbols on the reel. Of course, the five paylines mean there can be more than one payline win per spin. And there's also a wild symbol to help things along.\n\nIn terms of value, the star symbol pays the best amounts and is followed by the bell and double BAR symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines include Fire Joker, a classic Play N GO slot machine that will surely take you back in time when slot machines were simple yet brilliant. The slot game uses three reels and five paylines, which was once considered modern compared to single-payline slots at the beginning. The game can be played as soon as you find a casino on the right side of this article. The denomination of the slot starts at 0.05 euro and goes up to 100.00 euro, where the maximum multiplier of the Fire Joker slot is x80.\n        ",
