Use bright and vibrant colors that will catch the eye of players and make them want to try the game. Incorporate symbols from the game, such as the sacred carp, temple, bonsai, lantern, and fan, but also include key elements that relate to the Maya culture, such as feathers, jade, or stone temples.
