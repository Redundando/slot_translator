Ha una struttura classica con 5 rulli e 20 linee di pagamento sulle quali è possibile scommettere con un minimo di 0,20 centesimi. Il player viene trasportato in una realtà storica, per mettersi alla ricerca di tesori nascosti sfruttando un paio di funzionalità ben create. Tra questi la funzione Bonus Anubi che offre di scegliere personalmente dei premi in denaro, senza dimenticare poi i giri gratuiti che sono abbinati a un moltiplicatore 3x. I bonus in stile ‘Pick me’ sono sempre una divertente soluzione per i giocatori esperti ma anche per i principianti che si sentono direttamente coinvolti sulle azioni di gioco. Scopriamo insieme tutto ciò che di buono ha da offrire questa macchinetta.\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nAge of Egypt ha un buon aspetto grafico: ci troviamo sulle rive del Nilo durante un magico tramonto che ci mostra anche le piramidi in lontananza. Ogni mossa viene scandita da una colonna sonora in stile arabeggiante che accompagna l’intero gameplay del gioco base e cambia intensità nel momento in cui si attivano i giochi bonus. Tra i simboli spiccano Horus (il dio del cielo) e l’occhio di Horo, uniti alle immancabili carte reali A, K, Q, J e 10. Il simbolo speciale della Sfinge è scelto come Wild e ha il potere di prendere il posto di ogni altra icona per formare combinazioni vincenti. Ovviamente non può sostituire lo Scatter. Se si posizionano 2, 3, 4 o 5 Jolly sui rulli si ottengono 0,5, 10, 100 o 500 volte la tua scommessa. Ma la parte più affascinante è quella delle sue funzioni bonus. Abbiamo il Bonus Anubi che si attiva quando posizioni tre icone consecutivamente dal rullo uno fino al rullo due e tre. Qui potrai scegliere in autonomia il premio in denaro da aggiungere al tuo credito in base al numero di Simboli bonus che hai raccolto per attivare la stessa funzione.\nUn’altra funzione interessante è quella legata allo Scatter, rappresentato dalla regina del faraone: 3 o più icone in qualsiasi posizione sui rulli ti faranno ricevere Free Spin. Ne avrai 10 con un moltiplicatore 3x e se compariranno altri simboli Scatter durante la funzione speciale avrai altri 10 giri extra.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Age of Egypt\nSappiamo bene che l’Egitto è un tema molto amato dalle case di produzione che operano nel settore di gioco online, ma è altrettanto vero che ad amarlo sono i gamer. Per questo motivo ci sono numerose soluzioni di gioco che potrai trovare anche sul nostro sito. Age of Egypt però fa la differenza e risulta essere uno dei migliori mai creati e sviluppati per le piattaforme digitali. Non solo perché ha una bella grafica e un gameplay dinamico e intuitivo. Ma soprattutto perché sa rendere spettacolare l’esperienza del giocatore attraverso delle funzioni extra che sono piacevoli da provare. E che possono essere anche molto ricche in termini di vittorie ottenute.\nProvare per credere: è tempo di iniziare anche questo viaggio verso l’Antico Egitto!\n",

With a classic structure of 5 reels and 20 paylines, you can bet with a minimum of 0.20 cents. The player is transported into a historical reality, to search for hidden treasures using a couple of well-created features. Among these, the Anubis Bonus function offers to personally choose cash prizes, not forgetting the free spins that are combined with a 3x multiplier. The 'pick me' style bonuses are always a fun solution for experienced players, but also for beginners who feel directly involved in the game actions. Let's discover together all the good things this machine has to offer.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nAge of Egypt has a good graphical appearance: we are on the banks of the Nile during a magical sunset that also shows us the pyramids in the distance. Each move is marked by an Arabian-style soundtrack that accompanies the entire gameplay of the base game and changes intensity when the bonus games are activated. Among the symbols stand out Horus (the god of the sky) and the eye of Horo, combined with the inevitable royal cards A, K, Q, J, and 10. The special symbol of the Sphinx is chosen as the wild and has the power to take the place of any other icon to form winning combinations. Of course, it cannot replace the scatter. If you place 2, 3, 4, or 5 wilds on the reels, you will get 0.5, 10, 100, or 500 times your bet. But the most fascinating part is that of its bonus functions. We have the Anubis Bonus that activates when you position three icons from reel one to reel two and three consecutively. Here you can autonomously choose the cash prize to add to your credit based on the number of bonus symbols you have collected to activate the same function.\n\nAnother interesting function is that related to the scatter, represented by the queen of the pharaoh: 3 or more icons in any position on the reels will give you free spins. You will have 10 with a 3x multiplier, and if other scatter symbols appear during the special function, you will have another 10 extra spins.\n\nFinal considerations on the Age of Egypt slot\nWe know that Egypt is a theme much loved by production companies operating in the online gaming sector, but it is also true that gamers love it. For this reason, there are numerous gaming solutions that you can find on our site too. Age of Egypt, however, makes the difference and proves to be one of the best ever created and developed for digital platforms. Not just because it has a nice graphic and a dynamic and intuitive gameplay. But above all because it knows how to make the player's experience spectacular through extra functions that are pleasant to try. And that can also be very rich in terms of winnings obtained.\n\nTry and believe it: it's time to start this journey to ancient Egypt too!\n            ",

With a classic structure of 5 reels and 20 paylines, you can bet with a minimum of 0.20 cents. The player is transported into a historical reality, to search for hidden treasures using a couple of well-created features. Among these, the Anubis Bonus function offers to personally choose cash prizes, not forgetting the free spins that are combined with a 3x multiplier. The 'pick me' style bonuses are always a fun solution for experienced players, but also for beginners who feel directly involved in the game actions. Let's discover together all the good things this machine has to offer.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nAge of Egypt has a good graphical appearance: we are on the banks of the Nile during a magical sunset that also shows us the pyramids in the distance. Each move is marked by an Arabian-style soundtrack that accompanies the entire gameplay of the base game and changes intensity when the bonus games are activated. Among the symbols stand out Horus (the god of the sky) and the eye of Horo, combined with the inevitable royal cards A, K, Q, J, and 10. The special symbol of the Sphinx is chosen as the wild and has the power to take the place of any other icon to form winning combinations. Of course, it cannot replace the scatter. If you place 2, 3, 4, or 5 wilds on the reels, you will get 0.5, 10, 100, or 500 times your bet. But the most fascinating part is that of its bonus functions. We have the Anubis Bonus that activates when you position three icons from reel one to reel two and three consecutively. Here you can autonomously choose the cash prize to add to your credit based on the number of bonus symbols you have collected to activate the same function.\n\nAnother interesting function is that related to the scatter, represented by the queen of the pharaoh: 3 or more icons in any position on the reels will give you free spins. You will have 10 with a 3x multiplier, and if other scatter symbols appear during the special function, you will have another 10 extra spins.\n\nFinal considerations on the Age of Egypt slot\nWe know that Egypt is a theme much loved by production companies operating in the online gaming sector, but it is also true that gamers love it. For this reason, there are numerous gaming solutions that you can find on our site too. Age of Egypt, however, makes the difference and proves to be one of the best ever created and developed for digital platforms. Not just because it has a nice graphic and a dynamic and intuitive gameplay. But above all because it knows how to make the player's experience spectacular through extra functions that are pleasant to try. And that can also be very rich in terms of winnings obtained.\n\nTry and believe it: it's time to start this journey to ancient Egypt too!\n            ",

With a classic structure of 5 reels and 20 paylines, you can bet with a minimum of 0.20 cents. The player is transported into a historical reality, to search for hidden treasures using a couple of well-created features. Among these, the Anubis Bonus function offers to personally choose cash prizes, not forgetting the free spins that are combined with a 3x multiplier. The 'pick me' style bonuses are always a fun solution for experienced players, but also for beginners who feel directly involved in the game actions. Let's discover together all the good things this machine has to offer.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nAge of Egypt has a good graphical appearance: we are on the banks of the Nile during a magical sunset that also shows us the pyramids in the distance. Each move is marked by an Arabian-style soundtrack that accompanies the entire gameplay of the base game and changes intensity when the bonus games are activated. Among the symbols stand out Horus (the god of the sky) and the eye of Horo, combined with the inevitable royal cards A, K, Q, J, and 10. The special symbol of the Sphinx is chosen as the wild and has the power to take the place of any other icon to form winning combinations. Of course, it cannot replace the scatter. If you place 2, 3, 4, or 5 wilds on the reels, you will get 0.5, 10, 100, or 500 times your bet. But the most fascinating part is that of its bonus functions. We have the Anubis Bonus that activates when you position three icons from reel one to reel two and three consecutively. Here you can autonomously choose the cash prize to add to your credit based on the number of bonus symbols you have collected to activate the same function.\n\nAnother interesting function is that related to the scatter, represented by the queen of the pharaoh: 3 or more icons in any position on the reels will give you free spins. You will have 10 with a 3x multiplier, and if other scatter symbols appear during the special function, you will have another 10 extra spins.\n\nFinal considerations on the Age of Egypt slot\nWe know that Egypt is a theme much loved by production companies operating in the online gaming sector, but it is also true that gamers love it. For this reason, there are numerous gaming solutions that you can find on our site too. Age of Egypt, however, makes the difference and proves to be one of the best ever created and developed for digital platforms. Not just because it has a nice graphic and a dynamic and intuitive gameplay. But above all because it knows how to make the player's experience spectacular through extra functions that are pleasant to try. And that can also be very rich in terms of winnings obtained.\n\nTry and believe it: it's time to start this journey to ancient Egypt too!\n            ",
