            "response": "Esqueleto Explosivo 2 is a slot game brought to you by Thunderkick, featuring 5 reels and 99 pay lines. This sequel to the iconic Esqueleto Explosivo game can be played on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices, with bets ranging from 10 cents to 100 euros per spin. With an RTP of 96.13%, this Mexican Day of the Dead-inspired slot game includes a Dropping Symbols feature that allows you to win multiple times with new symbols and increases the Mucho Multiplier up to 32x. In the Bonus Game feature, you can win a lot of free spins with lower multipliers removed, increasing the base multiplier for successive wins - the multiplier can go up to 64x for 5,000x bets paid on every free spin.\n\nIf played on a maximum of 99 pay lines, Esqueleto Explosivo 2 gives you the chance to activate free spins and other extras, such as the explosive Wild. The game features a consecutive payout mechanism with Cascading Reels, which means that from a single spin, you can get more than one win.\n\nThunderkick is known for creating slots with memorable graphic designs, and Esqueleto Explosivo 2 is no exception. With crisp graphics and attention to detail, slot experts take us to a small Mexican town for a ride on the five reels and three rows. The town is in the background, and celebrations take place right in front of us.\n\nAll symbols are skulls with different expressions and qualities. There is a golden, smiling skull with a flat top and a triggerfish for hair, a dandelion skull, a guitarist, and so on. Each of the symbols in the Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot game is animated and brings the game to life even more. Therefore, it will be an exciting moment on the reel-set, whether you adopt a casual approach or take the game as it is.\n\nEsqueleto Explosivo 2, graphically, looks quite similar to the original - set in a Mexican street, this Day of the Dead-themed slot features 6 skull symbols. There is a cyan skull, an orange skull, a blue skull, a green skull, a pink skull, and a purple skull. The latter, which has earrings and roses, is the most rewarding, giving you 1, 2, or 5 times your bet for 3, 4, or 5 in a combination.\n\nPayments can occur on up to 99 pay lines, but this is only possible if the wins progress. The initial number of pay lines is 17, and the wins are composed of three or more matching symbols that start from left to right and occur on consecutive horizontal and diagonal reels.\n\nThe low wins of the symbols are not surprising, but this does not mean that the resulting win from a single spin will also be meager. The symbol that pays the most is the lady skull, which pays 5x the bet for five of the same.\n\nFortunately, Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot can lead to consecutive wins, and the extra features can help the amounts rise even higher. The main feature of the game is cascading or avalanche wins. Each win translates into a multiplier. The maximum is 32x on the concurrent win, which is the seventh consecutive win, regardless of the value of the symbol.\n\nA wild can replace any game symbol, except for the bonus. It only lands on the three middle reels. The wild explodes and removes between three and eight symbols that belong to the lower pay category.\n\nIt is a familiar environment to most other Thunderkick releases. All controls are at the bottom, on a stretch under the reel-set. In the bottom corner is the play button, autoplay, and betting.\n\nPress play to spin the reels once. Pressing it again does the same, deducting the selected bet once for each turn. If you want the game to spin the reels by itself, select the autoplay option. \n\nThis allows players to configure the Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot for automatic spinning mode. It is optional to add stops, such as a single win or a decrease in the total balance, which helps keep track of the balance.\n\nBets range from €0.10 for the smallest to €100.00 per spin for the maximum. The bet amount is the multiplier for the number of matching symbols on a pay line and each of these values can be seen in the paytable accessible by selecting the menu button in the bottom left corner.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nLet the mariachis play their guitars during your Day of the Dead on the Dia Muertos slot - a five-reel game with over 3,000 ways to pay in a consecutive victory style. Each win translates to a respin, and subsequent respins can turn your bet into an opportunity to make a lot of money, as getting five scatter symbols will result in seven bonus spins.\n\nFAQs\nCan I play Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot game for free?\nYes, you can do so directly on our website without registering or depositing.\n\nIs its RTP good?\nYes, its return to player exceeds the average of online slots and settles at 96.13%.\n\nHow many pay lines does the slot have?\nEsqueleto Explosivo 2 slot features up to 99 pay lines.",

This sequel to the iconic game Esqueleto Explosivo can be played on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices for 10 cents to 100 euros per spin. With an RTP of 96.13%, this Day of the Dead-inspired slot boasts a Dropping Symbols feature where you can win multiple times with new symbols - each win increases the Mucho Multiplier up to 32x. In the Bonus Game feature, you can win a plethora of free spins with lower multipliers removed and base multipliers increased for subsequent wins - the multiplier can go up to 64x for 5,000x payouts on every free spin.\n\nPlayed on up to 99 paylines, Esqueleto Explosivo 2 offers the chance to activate free spins and other extras, such as the explosive Wild. The game features cascading reels, meaning that you can get more than one win from a single spin. Thunderkick's graphic design for this slot is highly memorable with sharp, detailed graphics. All the symbols are skulls with different expressions and qualities, imparting a distinct Tex-Mex feel. With animated symbols, the game comes to life with every spin. \n\nNotably similar in appearance to the original, Esqueleto Explosivo 2 is set on a Mexican street with 6 skull symbols in cyan, orange, blue, green, pink, and purple. The latter, complete with earrings and roses, is the most rewarding, paying out 1, 2, or 5 times your bet for 3, 4, or 5 symbols respectively. \n\nAlthough the payouts from the symbols aren't particularly high, don't be disheartened as the game can result in consecutive wins, with extra features to push the amounts higher. The main feature of the game is cascading or avalanche wins, where each win is a multiplier. The maximum 32x multiplier occurs for the seventh consecutive win, regardless of the symbol's value. A Wild can replace any game symbol except for the bonus symbol, and only appears on the three middle reels. It explodes and removes between 3 and 8 symbols of lower value. \n\nFamiliar controls are located at the bottom of the reel-set, with the play button, autoplay, and bets in the corner. Autoplay allows players to configure the game for automatic spins, with the option to add stops such as when there is a single win or decreased total balance. Bets range from €0.10 for the smallest bet to €100.00 for the maximum bet per spin. The bet amount is the multiplier for matching symbols on a payline, with the values seen in the paytable accessible by selecting the menu button in the bottom-left corner. \n\nFor similar games, try the slot Dia Muertos, a five-reel game with over 3,000 ways to win in a consecutive wins style. Every win results in a respin, and subsequent respins have the potential to turn your bet into a money-making opportunity with five scatter symbols leading to seven bonus spins.\n\nFAQ\nCan I play Esqueleto Explosivo 2 for free?\nYes, you can do so directly on our site without registering or depositing. \n\nIs its RTP good? \nYes, the RTP surpasses the average for online slots and is pegged at 96.13%.\n\nHow many paylines does the slot have? \nThe Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot offers up to 99 paylines."

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Esqueleto Explosivo 2\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nEsqueleto Explosivo 2 is a slot game brought to you by Thunderkick, featuring 5 reels and 99 pay lines. This sequel to the iconic Esqueleto Explosivo game can be played on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices, with bets ranging from 10 cents to 100 euros per spin.

The game features a consecutive payout mechanism with Cascading Reels, which means that from a single spin, you can get more than one win.\n\nThunderkick is known for creating slots with memorable graphic designs, and Esqueleto Explosivo 2 is no exception. With crisp graphics and attention to detail, slot experts take us to a small Mexican town for a ride on the five reels and three rows. The town is in the background, and celebrations take place right in front of us.\n\nAll symbols are skulls with different expressions and qualities. There is a golden, smiling skull with a flat top and a triggerfish for hair, a dandelion skull, a guitarist, and so on. Each of the symbols in the Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot game is animated and brings the game to life even more. Therefore, it will be an exciting moment on the reel-set, whether you adopt a casual approach or take the game as it is.\n\nEsqueleto Explosivo 2, graphically, looks quite similar to the original - set in a Mexican street, this Day of the Dead-themed slot features 6 skull symbols. There is a cyan skull, an orange skull, a blue skull, a green skull, a pink skull, and a purple skull. The latter, which has earrings and roses, is the most rewarding, giving you 1, 2, or 5 times your bet for 3, 4, or 5 in a combination.\n\nPayments can occur on up to 99 pay lines, but this is only possible if the wins progress. The initial number of pay lines is 17, and the wins are composed of three or more matching symbols that start from left to right and occur on consecutive horizontal and diagonal reels.\n\nThe low wins of the symbols are not surprising, but this does not mean that the resulting win from a single spin will also be meager. The symbol that pays the most is the lady skull, which pays 5x the bet for five of the same.\n\nFortunately, Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot can lead to consecutive wins, and the extra features can help the amounts rise even higher. The main feature of the game is cascading or avalanche wins. Each win translates into a multiplier. The maximum is 32x on the concurrent win, which is the seventh consecutive win, regardless of the value of the symbol.\n\nA wild can replace any game symbol, except for the bonus. It only lands on the three middle reels. The wild explodes and removes between three and eight symbols that belong to the lower pay category.\n\nIt is a familiar environment to most other Thunderkick releases. All controls are at the bottom, on a stretch under the reel-set. In the bottom corner is the play button, autoplay, and betting.\n\nPress play to spin the reels once. Pressing it again does the same, deducting the selected bet once for each turn. If you want the game to spin the reels by itself, select the autoplay option. \n\nThis allows players to configure the Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot for automatic spinning mode. It is optional to add stops, such as a single win or a decrease in the total balance, which helps keep track of the balance.\n\nBets range from €0.10 for the smallest to €100.00 per spin for the maximum. The bet amount is the multiplier for the number of matching symbols on a pay line and each of these values can be seen in the paytable accessible by selecting the menu button in the bottom left corner.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nLet the mariachis play their guitars during your Day of the Dead on the Dia Muertos slot - a five-reel game with over 3,000 ways to pay in a consecutive victory style.

This sequel to the iconic Esqueleto Explosivo game can be played on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices, with bets ranging from 10 cents to 100 euros per spin. With an RTP of 96.13%, this Mexican Day of the Dead-inspired slot game includes a Dropping Symbols feature that allows you to win multiple times with new symbols and increases the Mucho Multiplier up to 32x. In the Bonus Game feature, you can win a lot of free spins with lower multipliers removed, increasing the base multiplier for successive wins - the multiplier can go up to 64x for 5,000x bets paid on every free spin.\n\nIf played on a maximum of 99 pay lines, Esqueleto Explosivo 2 gives you the chance to activate free spins and other extras, such as the explosive Wild. The game features a consecutive payout mechanism with Cascading Reels, which means that from a single spin, you can get more than one win.\n\nThunderkick is known for creating slots with memorable graphic designs, and Esqueleto Explosivo 2 is no exception. With crisp graphics and attention to detail, slot experts take us to a small Mexican town for a ride on the five reels and three rows. The town is in the background, and celebrations take place right in front of us.\n\nAll symbols are skulls with different expressions and qualities. There is a golden, smiling skull with a flat top and a triggerfish for hair, a dandelion skull, a guitarist, and so on. Each of the symbols in the Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot game is animated and brings the game to life even more. Therefore, it will be an exciting moment on the reel-set, whether you adopt a casual approach or take the game as it is.\n\nEsqueleto Explosivo 2, graphically, looks quite similar to the original - set in a Mexican street, this Day of the Dead-themed slot features 6 skull symbols. There is a cyan skull, an orange skull, a blue skull, a green skull, a pink skull, and a purple skull. The latter, which has earrings and roses, is the most rewarding, giving you 1, 2, or 5 times your bet for 3, 4, or 5 in a combination.\n\nPayments can occur on up to 99 pay lines, but this is only possible if the wins progress. The initial number of pay lines is 17, and the wins are composed of three or more matching symbols that start from left to right and occur on consecutive horizontal and diagonal reels.\n\nThe low wins of the symbols are not surprising, but this does not mean that the resulting win from a single spin will also be meager. The symbol that pays the most is the lady skull, which pays 5x the bet for five of the same.\n\nFortunately, Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot can lead to consecutive wins, and the extra features can help the amounts rise even higher. The main feature of the game is cascading or avalanche wins. Each win translates into a multiplier. The maximum is 32x on the concurrent win, which is the seventh consecutive win, regardless of the value of the symbol.\n\nA wild can replace any game symbol, except for the bonus. It only lands on the three middle reels. The wild explodes and removes between three and eight symbols that belong to the lower pay category.\n\nIt is a familiar environment to most other Thunderkick releases. All controls are at the bottom, on a stretch under the reel-set. In the bottom corner is the play button, autoplay, and betting.\n\nPress play to spin the reels once. Pressing it again does the same, deducting the selected bet once for each turn. If you want the game to spin the reels by itself, select the autoplay option. \n\nThis allows players to configure the Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot for automatic spinning mode. It is optional to add stops, such as a single win or a decrease in the total balance, which helps keep track of the balance.\n\nBets range from €0.10 for the smallest to €100.00 per spin for the maximum. The bet amount is the multiplier for the number of matching symbols on a pay line and each of these values can be seen in the paytable accessible by selecting the menu button in the bottom left corner.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nLet the mariachis play their guitars during your Day of the Dead on the Dia Muertos slot - a five-reel game with over 3,000 ways to pay in a consecutive victory style. Each win translates to a respin, and subsequent respins can turn your bet into an opportunity to make a lot of money, as getting five scatter symbols will result in seven bonus spins.\n\nFAQs\nCan I play Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot game for free?\nYes, you can do so directly on our website without registering or depositing.\n\nIs its RTP good?\nYes, its return to player exceeds the average of online slots and settles at 96.13%.\n\nHow many pay lines does the slot have?\nEsqueleto Explosivo 2 slot features up to 99 pay lines.\n            ",
