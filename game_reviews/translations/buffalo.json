Produced by Aristocrat, a historical and innovative software development house committed to the slot machine and online casino industry. This game will take you on a journey through the American prairies, where you will encounter the typical animals that inhabit these areas. The American Bison, an animal that has been on the brink of extinction during European colonization, is the main character of the game and the highest-paying symbol. With 1024 paylines, you will have no trouble creating excellent winning combinations.\n\nThe graphics of the game are meticulously designed, highlighting the attention to detail Aristocrat invests in ensuring high-quality products that are fun and entertaining. The symbols in the slot are iconic animals that populate the North American territories, including a bison, panther, eagle, elk, and white wolf. Special symbols include a golden coin, required to activate the bonus game, and a sunset landscape that serves as the wild symbol.\n\nBuffalo offers up to 1024 paylines and five reels with four symbols each, making it easier to create winning combinations. The wild symbol, Sunset Landscape, will appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 to complete any unsuccessful combinations. The scatter, the Golden Coin, can appear anywhere on the reels, granting you access to the bonus game with three, four, or five coins. Depending on the number of scatters, you can have 5 to 20 free initial spins, which can be infinitely reactivated if additional gold coins appear during their execution. You also have several multipliers during free spins, as the wild symbol will give you a variable multiplier of x2 or x3 that adds to your winnings. And lastly, you can try your luck by doubling or quadrupling your bet by guessing the color or suit of a hidden card through the slot's Gamble feature.\n\nBuffalo is a fascinating game full of multipliers and a good bonus for free spins, thanks to the high number of paylines. Other Aristocrat games with similar mechanics include Frogs and Flies and Lost Temple, both of which offer 1024 paylines like Buffalo.\n        ",
