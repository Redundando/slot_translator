The value of the chip ranges from one cent to 1 €, and you can bet up to 10 chips per spin, one for each line.\nThe beetles represent the slot symbols and alternate on the reels with the numbers and letters corresponding to the playing cards from 10 to Ace.\nThe beetles are characterized by different colors, each corresponding to a different value: the red beetle with an orange body is the highest value symbol that allows you to win a maximum of 5000 coins if it appears on all five reels. The green beetle with the blue gem is worth up to 2000 coins, while the ones with the green and purple gems have a maximum value of 750 coins.\nWild and Scatter symbols of Beetle Jewels\nThe purple beetle with the blue gem is the special symbol of Beetle Jewels as it plays both the role of Wild and Scatter. As a Wild, it acts as a wild card and replaces all other symbols in completing a winning combination, while as a Scatter, it gives away 10 free spins if it appears on the reels three, four, or five times.\nDuring the free spins, a special symbol is randomly selected and becomes expandable, thus increasing the chances of winning.\n        ",
