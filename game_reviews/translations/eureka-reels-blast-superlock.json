The game features five reels, three rows, and 50 fixed paylines, boasting unique features such as free spins, Lock It Links, and the Superlock Wheel. The game takes place underground, where gold miners search for precious minerals. The high-value symbols include an elderly miner, a donkey, a helmet, a cart full of gold, and a bucket of tools, while the low-value symbols are the J, Q, K and A playing card suits. The gold nugget wild symbol appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and substitutes for all other symbols except for the bonus mine entrance icon and the dynamite scatter symbol.\n\nSpecial Features and Symbols\n\nEureka Reels Blast Superlock offers several unique features and symbols, including the Gold Nugget Wild Symbol, Free Spins, Lock It Link Feature, and the Superlock Wheel. The Gold Nugget Wild Symbol substitutes for all other symbols with the exception of the bonus mine entrance icon and the dynamite scatter symbol. The Free Spins feature triggers after receiving three or more bonus symbols, awarding up to 20 free spins. During the free spins round, the Superlock Wheel Overlay can appear on the Dynamite Scatter. The Lock It Link Feature is triggered by landing at least six Dynamite Scatter Symbols and rewards you with five Lock it Link Feature Spins. The Superlock Wheel is filled with special prizes, including free spins, Lock It Link Feature, jackpots, or a credit prize as you spin it.\n\nSuperlock Wheel\n\nThe Superlock Wheel is one of the most exciting features of Eureka Reels Blast Superlock. This wheel appears when three or more Dynamite Scatter Symbols are present on the reels. The wheel contains special prizes, such as free spins, Lock It Link Feature, jackpots or a credit prize, and it spins until you reveal a credit prize. The Superlock Wheel Overlay can appear on the Dynamite Scatter during Free Spins, and if you are lucky enough to trigger the Lock It Link Feature while playing the wheel, you earn one additional spin. The Superlock Wheel adds an extra layer of excitement and potential winnings to an already thrilling game.\n\nLock It Link Feature\n\nThe Lock It Link Feature is triggered by landing at least six Dynamite Scatter Symbols during regular gameplay. The symbols that activated the feature and any new ones you receive remain locked in place for the duration of the feature. If you land a Superlock Wheel Overlay during this time, you earn one spin of the wheel, with its unique prizes. Adjacent Dynamite can group together and form shapes that come with bonuses during this feature, making it even more exciting and potentially rewarding.\n\nOther Mining Themed Slot Games\n\nEureka Reels Blast Superlock is a mining-themed slot game, and there several other fun slots based on this exciting theme. Dwarf Mine is a five-reel, four-row, and 1024-ways-to-win game developed by Yggdrasil that takes players on a mining adventure.
