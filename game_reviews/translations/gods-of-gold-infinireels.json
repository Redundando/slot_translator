What starts as a 27-payline game on a 3x3 layout can quickly expand into a huge number of ways to win and reels, with every consecutive win. The maximum exposure is about 5000x on the winning bet, and for features, there is a free spins bonus and two reel modifiers with guaranteed wins.\n\nGods of Gold Infinireels once again proves that NetEnt can do more than just create beautiful graphics for their slots. It's a game where the giant innovates and introduces a new mechanic that seems promising for the future. This is a different type of game compared to many others from this company, which usually focuses more on the casual player, while here it seems to target players who are okay with high volatility.\n\nWith this game, you initially play with 3 reels and 3 rows of symbols, along with 27 ways to win, but you also get the Infinireels mechanic, which allows for an infinite number of ways to win by adding more reels. In addition to this unusual mechanism, the slot also has the wild symbol, random respins, Multi Slam, or guaranteed payout free spins. Ultimately, this game has medium to high volatility, prizes up to 5,000x the stake, along with an RTP of 96.12%.\n\nA Mythical and Precious Graphic\n\nNetEnt's artists started this game with a fresh head on their shoulders, and the result is a game that doesn't fail to impress experienced gamblers. The symbols are divided into the usual two categories: those that pay well are masks and statues of deities, and the other category has gems in a few different shapes.\n\nThe Gods of Gold Infinireels slot machines are dynamic, and that's the minimum. The infinireels payout system does its job to electrify the dance on the reel-set, and there are some animated bits that are a nice touch. To wrap it all up nicely, NetEnt has hired a talented composer to find a dramatic leitmotif that follows the adventure of this reel.\n\nThe theme of Gods of Gold Infinireels seems to be a strange mix between the divine aspect and Arab history. It seems to include the Genie, huge piles of gold and precious stones, along with Wilds and Scatters, a King, a Queen, a Bull, and an Owl. The minor symbols are characterized by precious stones. It's not much of a story or theme, but the quality of the design is quite high, just like you can find in many other NetEnt titles.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\n\nThe game has the familiar NetEnt layout, which is a revamped version of their settings and control bar that they have kept for years. This is improved and makes the betting setup involve fewer clicks and spins, thanks to the removal of the bet level option.\n\nBets on the Gods of Gold Infinireels slot start at a reasonable €0.20 per spin and end at a maximum of €100.00. The maximum is now the new normal amount for a maximum bet, which is a more sensible bet than those offered in most of their previous releases.\n\nTo select your bet, simply choose the coin value by clicking or tapping the minus and plus buttons, and watch the amount in the BET window change. The Spin button is located at the bottom center, just below the third reel. To the right is the fast-forward symbol that makes the reels spin faster when activated.\n\nAs we said at the beginning, the reel-set starts with three reels, and wins are made in 27 ways to win. With every winning result, more reels are added. These start with three matching symbols that must appear on consecutive reels.\n\nIf another matching symbol is added to the equation that resulted from the arrival of the new reel, the reel set on the Gods of Gold Infinireels slot will expand once again. Wilds can replace any standard game symbol, which means they can also cause new reels to appear.\n\nThis is essential for a reversal of the cascade reel system, with the only difference being the addition of new reels instead of subtracting winning symbols. In terms of payouts, the most valuable symbol in the game is the king with the red hat. Ten of his symbols pay an incredible 160x on the winning bet, while five of the same pay 5x.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nImagine how beautiful and mysterious it is to walk through the deep jungle of the Aztec kingdom to discover the golden discs that trigger the highly anticipated bonus in the Aztec Gold Megaways slot. The game has a total prize of 19,200x multiplied by the winning bet, which can happen in a single spin. With an RTP of 95.99% and three jackpot prizes, this is a megaway slot that shouldn't be overlooked.",

The maximum exposure is around 5000x on the winning bet, and for features, there is a free spins bonus and two reel modifiers with guaranteed wins.\n\nGods of Gold Infinireels is once again proof that NetEnt can do more than just create beautiful graphics for their slots. It is a game where the giant innovates and introduces a new mechanic that seems promising for the future. It is a different type of game compared to many others that come from this company, which is usually more focused on the casual player, while this one seems to appeal to players who are okay with high volatility.\n\nWith this game, you initially play with 3 reels and 3 rows of symbols, together with 27 ways to win, but you also get the Infinireels mechanic, which allows for an infinite number of ways to win by adding more reels. In addition to this unusual mechanism, the slot also has the wild symbol, random respins, Multi Slam or free spins that are guaranteed to pay. Ultimately, this game has a medium-high volatility, prizes up to 5000x the stake, together with an RTP of 96.12%.\n\nThe graphics are mythical and precious. The symbols are divided into the two usual categories, with the ones that pay well being masks and statues of deities, while the other category has gems in various shapes. The slot Gods of Gold Infinireels is dynamic, and the payout system infinireels does its job to electrify the dance on the reel-set, with animated bits that are a beautiful thing.\n\nTo wrap it all up, NetEnt has engaged a talented composer to find a dramatic leitmotif that follows the adventure of this reel. The theme of Gods of Gold Infinireels seems to be a strange mix of divine appearance and Arabian history. It includes the Genie, huge stacks of gold and precious stones, along with Wild and Scatter, a King, a Queen, a Bull, and an Owl. The minor symbols are characterized by precious stones. It may not be a great story or theme, but the quality of the design is pretty high, just like in many other NetEnt titles.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe game has the familiar NetEnt layout, which is a reworked version of their settings and control bar that they have maintained for years. This is improved and makes the betting setup require fewer clicks and spins thanks to the removal of the option of betting levels.\n\nBets in the slot Gods of Gold Infinireels start with a reasonable €0.20 per spin and end with a maximum of €100.00. The maximum is now the new normal amount for a maximum bet, which is a more sensible bet compared to those offered in most of their previous releases.\n\nTo select your bet, simply choose the coin value by clicking or tapping the less and more buttons and watch the amount in the BET window change. The Spin button is located at the bottom center, just below the third reel. On the right, there is the fast forward symbol that makes the reels spin faster when activated.\n\nAs we said at the beginning, the reel-set starts with three reels, and wins are made in 27 ways to win. With every winning result, more reels are added. These start with three matching symbols that must occur on consecutive reels.\n\nIf another matching symbol is added to the equation resulting from the arrival of the new reel, the reel set on the Gods of Gold Infinireels slot will expand once again. Wilds can substitute any standard game symbol, which means they can also cause new reels to appear.\n\nThis is essential for a reversal of the cascading reel system, with the only difference being the addition of new reels instead of subtracting winning symbols. In terms of payout, the most valuable symbol in the game is the King with the red hat. Ten of his symbols pay an incredible 160x on the winning bet, and five of the same pay 5x.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nImagine how nice and mysterious it is to walk through the deep jungle of the Aztec kingdom to discover the gold disks that trigger the long-awaited bonus in the Aztec Gold Megaways slot. The game offers a total prize of 19,200x multiplied by the winning bet, which can occur from a single spin. With an RTP of 95.99% and three jackpot prizes, this is a megaway slot that should not be overlooked."

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay\nGraphics and Sound\nInfinireels Feature\nWinning Potential\nBonus Features\nTheme and Design\nCompatibility\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Gods of Gold Infinireels is NetEnt's latest slot game featuring the infinite reel payment system. What starts as a 27-payline game on a 3x3 layout can quickly expand into a huge number of ways to win and reels, with every consecutive win. The maximum exposure is about 5000x on the winning bet, and for features, there is a free spins bonus and two reel modifiers with guaranteed wins.\n\nGods of Gold Infinireels once again proves that NetEnt can do more than just create beautiful graphics for their slots. It's a game where the giant innovates and introduces a new mechanic that seems promising for the future. This is a different type of game compared to many others from this company, which usually focuses more on the casual player, while here it seems to target players who are okay with high volatility.\n\nWith this game, you initially play with 3 reels and 3 rows of symbols, along with 27 ways to win, but you also get the Infinireels mechanic, which allows for an infinite number of ways to win by adding more reels. In addition to this unusual mechanism, the slot also has the wild symbol, random respins, Multi Slam, or guaranteed payout free spins. Ultimately, this game has medium to high volatility, prizes up to 5,000x the stake, along with an RTP of 96.12%.\n\nA Mythical and Precious Graphic\n\nNetEnt's artists started this game with a fresh head on their shoulders, and the result is a game that doesn't fail to impress experienced gamblers. The symbols are divided into the usual two categories: those that pay well are masks and statues of deities, and the other category has gems in a few different shapes.\n\nThe Gods of Gold Infinireels slot machines are dynamic, and that's the minimum. The infinireels payout system does its job to electrify the dance on the reel-set, and there are some animated bits that are a nice touch. To wrap it all up nicely, NetEnt has hired a talented composer to find a dramatic leitmotif that follows the adventure of this reel.\n\nThe theme of Gods of Gold Infinireels seems to be a strange mix between the divine aspect and Arab history. It seems to include the Genie, huge piles of gold and precious stones, along with Wilds and Scatters, a King, a Queen, a Bull, and an Owl. The minor symbols are characterized by precious stones. It's not much of a story or theme, but the quality of the design is quite high, just like you can find in many other NetEnt titles.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\n\nThe game has the familiar NetEnt layout, which is a revamped version of their settings and control bar that they have kept for years. This is improved and makes the betting setup involve fewer clicks and spins, thanks to the removal of the bet level option.\n\nBets on the Gods of Gold Infinireels slot start at a reasonable €0.20 per spin and end at a maximum of €100.00. The maximum is now the new normal amount for a maximum bet, which is a more sensible bet than those offered in most of their previous releases.\n\nTo select your bet, simply choose the coin value by clicking or tapping the minus and plus buttons, and watch the amount in the BET window change. The Spin button is located at the bottom center, just below the third reel. To the right is the fast-forward symbol that makes the reels spin faster when activated.\n\nAs we said at the beginning, the reel-set starts with three reels, and wins are made in 27 ways to win. With every winning result, more reels are added. These start with three matching symbols that must appear on consecutive reels.\n\nIf another matching symbol is added to the equation that resulted from the arrival of the new reel, the reel set on the Gods of Gold Infinireels slot will expand once again. Wilds can replace any standard game symbol, which means they can also cause new reels to appear.\n\nThis is essential for a reversal of the cascade reel system, with the only difference being the addition of new reels instead of subtracting winning symbols. In terms of payouts, the most valuable symbol in the game is the king with the red hat. Ten of his symbols pay an incredible 160x on the winning bet, while five of the same pay 5x.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nImagine how beautiful and mysterious it is to walk through the deep jungle of the Aztec kingdom to discover the golden discs that trigger the highly anticipated bonus in the Aztec Gold Megaways slot. The game has a total prize of 19,200x multiplied by the winning bet, which can happen in a single spin. With an RTP of 95.99% and three jackpot prizes, this is a megaway slot that shouldn't be overlooked.\n            ",

What starts as a 27-payline game on a 3x3 layout can quickly expand into a huge number of ways to win and reels, with every consecutive win. The maximum exposure is about 5000x on the winning bet, and for features, there is a free spins bonus and two reel modifiers with guaranteed wins.\n\nGods of Gold Infinireels once again proves that NetEnt can do more than just create beautiful graphics for their slots. It's a game where the giant innovates and introduces a new mechanic that seems promising for the future. This is a different type of game compared to many others from this company, which usually focuses more on the casual player, while here it seems to target players who are okay with high volatility.\n\nWith this game, you initially play with 3 reels and 3 rows of symbols, along with 27 ways to win, but you also get the Infinireels mechanic, which allows for an infinite number of ways to win by adding more reels. In addition to this unusual mechanism, the slot also has the wild symbol, random respins, Multi Slam, or guaranteed payout free spins. Ultimately, this game has medium to high volatility, prizes up to 5,000x the stake, along with an RTP of 96.12%.\n\nA Mythical and Precious Graphic\n\nNetEnt's artists started this game with a fresh head on their shoulders, and the result is a game that doesn't fail to impress experienced gamblers. The symbols are divided into the usual two categories: those that pay well are masks and statues of deities, and the other category has gems in a few different shapes.\n\nThe Gods of Gold Infinireels slot machines are dynamic, and that's the minimum. The infinireels payout system does its job to electrify the dance on the reel-set, and there are some animated bits that are a nice touch. To wrap it all up nicely, NetEnt has hired a talented composer to find a dramatic leitmotif that follows the adventure of this reel.\n\nThe theme of Gods of Gold Infinireels seems to be a strange mix between the divine aspect and Arab history. It seems to include the Genie, huge piles of gold and precious stones, along with Wilds and Scatters, a King, a Queen, a Bull, and an Owl. The minor symbols are characterized by precious stones. It's not much of a story or theme, but the quality of the design is quite high, just like you can find in many other NetEnt titles.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\n\nThe game has the familiar NetEnt layout, which is a revamped version of their settings and control bar that they have kept for years. This is improved and makes the betting setup involve fewer clicks and spins, thanks to the removal of the bet level option.\n\nBets on the Gods of Gold Infinireels slot start at a reasonable €0.20 per spin and end at a maximum of €100.00. The maximum is now the new normal amount for a maximum bet, which is a more sensible bet than those offered in most of their previous releases.\n\nTo select your bet, simply choose the coin value by clicking or tapping the minus and plus buttons, and watch the amount in the BET window change. The Spin button is located at the bottom center, just below the third reel.

With every winning result, more reels are added. These start with three matching symbols that must appear on consecutive reels.\n\nIf another matching symbol is added to the equation that resulted from the arrival of the new reel, the reel set on the Gods of Gold Infinireels slot will expand once again. Wilds can replace any standard game symbol, which means they can also cause new reels to appear.\n\nThis is essential for a reversal of the cascade reel system, with the only difference being the addition of new reels instead of subtracting winning symbols. In terms of payouts, the most valuable symbol in the game is the king with the red hat.

The game has a total prize of 19,200x multiplied by the winning bet, which can happen in a single spin. With an RTP of 95.99% and three jackpot prizes, this is a megaway slot that shouldn't be overlooked.\n            ",

What starts as a 27-payline game on a 3x3 layout can quickly expand into a huge number of ways to win and reels, with every consecutive win. The maximum exposure is about 5000x on the winning bet, and for features, there is a free spins bonus and two reel modifiers with guaranteed wins.\n\nGods of Gold Infinireels once again proves that NetEnt can do more than just create beautiful graphics for their slots. It's a game where the giant innovates and introduces a new mechanic that seems promising for the future. This is a different type of game compared to many others from this company, which usually focuses more on the casual player, while here it seems to target players who are okay with high volatility.\n\nWith this game, you initially play with 3 reels and 3 rows of symbols, along with 27 ways to win, but you also get the Infinireels mechanic, which allows for an infinite number of ways to win by adding more reels. In addition to this unusual mechanism, the slot also has the wild symbol, random respins, Multi Slam, or guaranteed payout free spins. Ultimately, this game has medium to high volatility, prizes up to 5,000x the stake, along with an RTP of 96.12%.\n\nA Mythical and Precious Graphic\n\nNetEnt's artists started this game with a fresh head on their shoulders, and the result is a game that doesn't fail to impress experienced gamblers. The symbols are divided into the usual two categories: those that pay well are masks and statues of deities, and the other category has gems in a few different shapes.\n\nThe Gods of Gold Infinireels slot machines are dynamic, and that's the minimum. The infinireels payout system does its job to electrify the dance on the reel-set, and there are some animated bits that are a nice touch. To wrap it all up nicely, NetEnt has hired a talented composer to find a dramatic leitmotif that follows the adventure of this reel.\n\nThe theme of Gods of Gold Infinireels seems to be a strange mix between the divine aspect and Arab history. It seems to include the Genie, huge piles of gold and precious stones, along with Wilds and Scatters, a King, a Queen, a Bull, and an Owl. The minor symbols are characterized by precious stones. It's not much of a story or theme, but the quality of the design is quite high, just like you can find in many other NetEnt titles.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\n\nThe game has the familiar NetEnt layout, which is a revamped version of their settings and control bar that they have kept for years. This is improved and makes the betting setup involve fewer clicks and spins, thanks to the removal of the bet level option.\n\nBets on the Gods of Gold Infinireels slot start at a reasonable €0.20 per spin and end at a maximum of €100.00. The maximum is now the new normal amount for a maximum bet, which is a more sensible bet than those offered in most of their previous releases.\n\nTo select your bet, simply choose the coin value by clicking or tapping the minus and plus buttons, and watch the amount in the BET window change. The Spin button is located at the bottom center, just below the third reel. To the right is the fast-forward symbol that makes the reels spin faster when activated.\n\nAs we said at the beginning, the reel-set starts with three reels, and wins are made in 27 ways to win. With every winning result, more reels are added. These start with three matching symbols that must appear on consecutive reels.\n\nIf another matching symbol is added to the equation that resulted from the arrival of the new reel, the reel set on the Gods of Gold Infinireels slot will expand once again. Wilds can replace any standard game symbol, which means they can also cause new reels to appear.\n\nThis is essential for a reversal of the cascade reel system, with the only difference being the addition of new reels instead of subtracting winning symbols. In terms of payouts, the most valuable symbol in the game is the king with the red hat. Ten of his symbols pay an incredible 160x on the winning bet, while five of the same pay 5x.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nImagine how beautiful and mysterious it is to walk through the deep jungle of the Aztec kingdom to discover the golden discs that trigger the highly anticipated bonus in the Aztec Gold Megaways slot. The game has a total prize of 19,200x multiplied by the winning bet, which can happen in a single spin.
