Let me tell you about the glorious mechanics of 'Leprechaun Goes Wild'. This 5-reel, 4-row slot game will take you on an exciting adventure with up to twenty symbols per spin. And hold on to your shamrocks, because if you find at least three Shamrock symbols (Scatter), you'll trigger the bonus mode! It includes a rotating shamrock that will make you feel as dizzy as if you've had one too many pints, but it's totally worth it. You'll get a variable number of free spins that can also be re-triggered during the mode! And if you happen to stumble upon some leprechaun symbols, don't fret, they play the role of Wild and will remain anchored inside the game grid. This gives players the possibility of obtaining unusual winnings, especially in the final part of the function, where the symbols will be numerous. It's like finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but better, because you get to keep playing!</p>\"\n}"

The bonus mode is triggered by finding at least three Shamrock symbols (Scatter), and it includes a rotating shamrock that allows players to get a variable number of free spins, which can also be re-triggered during the mode. The leprechaun symbols, which play the role of Wild, will remain anchored inside the game grid, giving players the possibility of obtaining unusual winnings, especially in the final part of the function where symbols will be numerous.\n\nGraphics and Sound Effects\n\nLeprechaun Goes Wild is a slot game that features vivid colors and details on the game grid and symbols. The game opens on the boundless green fields of Ireland with some carved and typically Celtic stones visible. A cheerful and upbeat music, made of percussion and string instruments, serves as the background, making the gameplay experience exciting and enjoyable.\n\nBonus Features\n\nLeprechaun Goes Wild's bonus feature is triggered by finding at least three Shamrock symbols (Scatter), and it includes a rotating shamrock that allows players to get a variable number of free spins, which can also be re-triggered during the mode. The leprechaun symbols, which play the role of Wild, will remain anchored inside the game grid, giving players the possibility of obtaining unusual winnings, especially in the final part of the function where symbols will be numerous. This mode has quickly gained a fan base in the online slot sector.\n\nPayout Potential\n\nLeprechaun Goes Wild has a maximum payout of 10,000 times the player's bet size. The bonus mode, triggered by finding at least three Shamrock symbols (Scatter), can significantly increase the player's winnings. The leprechaun symbols, which play the role of Wild, will remain anchored inside the game grid, giving players the possibility of obtaining unusual winnings, especially in the final part of the function where symbols will be numerous.\n\nTheme and Symbols\n\nLeprechaun Goes Wild's theme is Irish folklore, featuring the legendary figures of leprechauns. The symbols of the slot game are as Irish culture-inherent as we can find, including beer steins, pipes, horseshoes, pots overflowing with gold coins that leprechauns hide at the base of the rainbow, and the leprechaun himself smiling at us amiably but also a little mischievously.\n\n        \n            ",

These red-haired and green-clothed goblins are mainly beloved for the prosperity they bestow only on the luckiest. \nLeprechaun Goes Wild by Play'N Go is a slot game where players challenge fate to obtain these riches so jealously guarded by lively leprechauns. In this review, we will cover various points of this online slot game, starting with its graphics and ending with its gameplay. Let's see what awaits us! \n\nLeprechaun Goes Wild - Graphics \nThe Leprechaun Goes Wild slot game opens on the boundless green fields of Ireland, with some carved and typically Celtic stones visible. On a blue sky, we find the game grid exquisitely decorated. \nThe symbols of the slot game are as Irish culture-inherent as we can find. The emerald green reels serve as a background to illustrations of beer steins, pipes, horseshoes, the typical pot overflowing with gold coins that leprechauns hide at the base of the rainbow, and of course, the leprechaun itself, smiling at us amiably but also a little mischievously. \nA cheerful and upbeat music, made of percussion and string instruments, serves as the background to the enjoyable slot. Leprechaun Goes Wild is a slot game full of vivid colors and details, making the gameplay experience a true feast for the eyes. Let's move on to the next point of the review and discover if even the purely playful aspect of this slot game lives up to its visual part. \n\nLeprechaun Goes Wild - Gameplay \nLet's move on to the technical aspect: we are facing a slot game with very wide reels. Against the classic 5 * 3 mechanism, in fact, we face a five by four, a game grid that allows us to see up to twenty symbols per spin. \nThe bonus mode, one of the aspects that interest our readers the most, is triggered by finding at least three Shamrock symbols (Scatter). At this point, a rotating shamrock will appear, allowing us to get a variable number of free spins, which can also be re-triggered during the mode. \nThe leprechaun symbols, which will play the role of Wild within this mode, will remain anchored inside the game grid, giving the possibility of obtaining unusual winnings, especially in the final part of the function (when the symbols will be numerous). \nA generous mode that has soon gained a fan base in the online slot sector. \n\nLeprechaun Goes Wild - Similar Slots \nAs easy as it is to understand, slots that deal with Irish culture but above all the figure of mischievous leprechauns, abound. The most interesting ones are undoubtedly: Charms & Clovers, Clover Tales, Lucky Lands, Rainbrew, and Goldwin's.\n            ",

Let's move on to the next point of the review and discover if even the purely playful aspect of this slot game lives up to its visual part. \n\nLeprechaun Goes Wild - Gameplay \nLet's move on to the technical aspect: we are facing a slot game with very wide reels. Against the classic 5 * 3 mechanism, in fact, we face a five by four, a game grid that allows us to see up to twenty symbols per spin. \nThe bonus mode, one of the aspects that interest our readers the most, is triggered by finding at least three Shamrock symbols (Scatter). At this point, a rotating shamrock will appear, allowing us to get a variable number of free spins, which can also be re-triggered during the mode. \nThe leprechaun symbols, which will play the role of Wild within this mode, will remain anchored inside the game grid, giving the possibility of obtaining unusual winnings, especially in the final part of the function (when the symbols will be numerous). \nA generous mode that has soon gained a fan base in the online slot sector. \n\nLeprechaun Goes Wild - Similar Slots \nAs easy as it is to understand, slots that deal with Irish culture but above all the figure of mischievous leprechauns, abound. The most interesting ones are undoubtedly: Charms & Clovers, Clover Tales, Lucky Lands, Rainbrew, and Goldwin's.\n        ",
