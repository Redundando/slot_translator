The volatility is medium/high, and the Return To Player (RTP) stands at a canonical 96.53%. On the main screen, there is a button (i) that allows you to access the paytable, where you can preview the value of the various symbols and how much their combinations pay. The special Feature of this slot is the Bonus game called \"Reveal Jackpot,\" which offers the opportunity to win one of the four Jackpots provided by Mustang Gold, starting from the Mini, with a value of 50X, up to the Grand Jackpot with a value of 1000 times the bet. The Wild symbol replaces all other symbols in determining winning combinations, except for the Scatter and the \"Money\" and \"Collect\" symbols. The Scatter is the campfire and grants access to free spins. The Money symbol and the Collect symbol are other special symbols. The Money symbol changes randomly on each spin and can lead to winning the Jackpot, while the Collect symbol only appears on the fifth reel and, when combined with the Money symbol, triggers the Bonus game.\n\nTheme and Graphics\n\nThe theme of Mustang Gold is the Wild West, with its vast expanses, horses and wild animals, ranches, and, of course, cowboys. The graphics play heavily on contrast: on a dark background, we have warm colors tending towards yellow/orange, reminiscent of the clearings of the Wild West, for an undoubtedly engaging and intriguing gaming experience. It is a nostalgic flashback for those who are fans of famous TV series like \"Fury, the Horse of the West.\"\n\nBetting Options\n\nThe betting range for this game is from a minimum of €0.25 to a maximum of €125 per spin. The low minimum bet range makes this game accessible to players with lower budgets, while the high maximum bet range makes it appealing to high-rollers with bigger budgets. Players can adjust their bet size using the plus and minus buttons located on either side of the spin button.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nMustang Gold has a medium/high volatility, which means that although the winnings are not very frequent, when they do come, there are good chances that they will have some value. The Return To Player (RTP) stands at a canonical 96.53%, which is an average figure for online slots. Players can expect to win back €96.53 out of €100 bet on this game, on average.\n\nBonus Opportunities\n\nThe special Feature of this slot is the Bonus game called \"Reveal Jackpot,\" which offers the opportunity to win one of the four Jackpots provided by Mustang Gold, starting from the Mini, with a value of 50X, up to the Grand Jackpot with a value of 1000 times the bet.

If so, this slot game will be a pleasant flashback to the '80s and '90s. But even if you are too young to remember, you will still embark on an exciting adventure in the beloved old West, riding a horse named Mustang.\n\nThe setting is the Wild West, with its vast expanses, horses and wild animals, ranches, and, of course, cowboys. The graphics play heavily on contrast: on a dark background, we have warm colors tending towards yellow/orange, reminiscent of the clearings of the Wild West, for an undoubtedly engaging and intriguing gaming experience.\n\nMustang Gold: gameplay and RTP\nAs far as the gameplay is concerned, it is a classic five-reel, 25-payline slot machine, with a betting range from a minimum of €0.25 to a maximum of €125 per spin. The volatility is medium/high, which means that although the winnings are not very frequent, when they do come, there are good chances that they will have some value.\n\nThe Return To Player (RTP), almost traditionally for Pragmatic Play slots, stands at a canonical 96.53%. On the main screen, there is a button (i) that allows you to access the paytable, where you can preview the value of the various symbols and how much their combinations pay.\n\nRegular and special symbols of Mustang Gold\nAmong the regular symbols of this slot machine, we find the traditional playing cards, from J to Ace, which are the symbols that pay the least. On the other hand, the thematic symbols are represented by two colts, one dark and one white, the latter with a higher value, two cowboys, a campfire, and a golden horseshoe.\n\nThe slot logo is the Wild symbol, which replaces all other symbols in determining winning combinations, except for the Scatter and the \"Money\" and \"Collect\" symbols. The Scatter is the campfire, and it grants access to free spins.\n\nAmong the other special symbols, we find the Money symbol and the Collect symbol: the former changes its value randomly on each spin and can lead to winning the Jackpot, while the Collect symbol only appears on the fifth reel and, when combined with the Money symbol, triggers the Bonus game.\n\nThe special Feature of this slot is the Bonus game called \"Reveal Jackpot,\" which offers the opportunity to win one of the four Jackpots provided by Mustang Gold, starting from the Mini, with a value of 50X, up to the Grand Jackpot with a value of 1000 times the bet. \n\nOverall, Mustang Gold is a thrilling and rewarding slot game that will satisfy even the most experienced of gamblers, with its exciting gameplay, impressive graphics, and lucrative opportunities to strike it big with a Jackpot win.\n            ",
