It contains incredible design elements, numerous bonus features, and a huge jackpot, so it's everything an online slot pro could dream of! The only drawback is the slightly lower RTP than the average, but with the wealth of extras, you really can't complain!\n            ",

If you are a daredevil, face the scariest night of the year by betting with real money or continue in demo mode!\nGameplay not suitable for the faint-hearted!\nThe game consists of 5 reels on 3 separate rows, with 30 fixed paylines available to the player. It is a high roller slot, with a minimum bet starting from €300.00 and going up to a maximum of €60,000.00, so you will need a good sized bankroll if you want to have fun on Halloween night!\nWhat are the bonus features of O’Lantern vs The Headless Horseman?\nThere are many bonus features on offer to increase your winnings in addition to a huge jackpot of €4,000,000 and an RTP of 95.6%. Let's take a look at the extra bonus features:\n\nExpanding Headless Horseman Scatter - This feature is activated when three or more Headless Horseman symbols appear anywhere on the reels. The symbols will move until three or more reels have expanded. During the expansion, your bet can be multiplied by a superb 1551x.\nJack Burning Bonus - If a Jack O' Lantern appears on the board after regular combinations have appeared, the Jack Burning feature is activated. The symbol catches fire and will randomly burn other symbols on the reels, turning them into Jack symbols. When the bonus is over, you will be paid for any Jack combinations on the reels. During the game, your bet can be multiplied by 1702x!\n\nWhat is the Fight the Shadows minigame?\nWhen bonus symbols appear on reels 3, 4 or 5, you will be awarded 10, 20 or 30 free spins. Horseman and Jack then remove symbols one by one until only one remains, which will activate as a bonus for the Free Spins phase. When the free spins start and all regular combinations are shown, if the selected bonus symbol appears 3 times on the reels, it will expand and occupy all surrounding space. Important! The symbols must never be next to each other if you want a combination to be activated.\nWatch out for the Wilds and the terrifying Jackpot!\n\nThe Wild, which takes the form of a cross, pays the highest sums on the board if paired with other wilds, and as in the standard feature, replaces any other symbol to create winning combinations.\nThe extraordinary jackpot of O’Lantern vs The Headless Horseman works like this: if you manage to trigger the jackpot, the game will release €4,000,000, skyrocketing your initial game count!\n\nThe Halloween theme becomes even more frightening\nOf all the Halloween-themed slots on the market, this game is in the Top Five! It contains incredible design elements, numerous bonus features, and a huge jackpot, so it's everything an online slot pro could dream of! The only drawback is the slightly lower RTP than the average, but with the wealth of extras, you really can't complain!\n            ",
