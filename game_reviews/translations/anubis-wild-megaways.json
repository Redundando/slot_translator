    "original_text": "\nAnubis Wild Megaways\nL’antico Egitto è uno dei temi più diffusi nel mondo delle slot, quindi quando ci si cimenta con questa ambientazione è importante offrire spunti interessanti per il giocatore. Dobbiamo dire che è proprio quello che ha fatto la Inspired Gaming con Anubis Wild Megaways, che come dice il titolo si ispira al culto di Anubi, il Dio dalla testa di sciacallo protettore  dei cimiteri e del regno dei morti. Cleopatra, lo scarabeo dorato, l’occhio di Horus, le piramidi e le sfingi sono alcuni dei simboli che ci fanno fare un tuffo in questa epoca leggendaria. Lo sfondo su cui si muovono i rulli è una camera mortuaria con le pareti affrescati con numerosi geroglifici e il comparto sonoro è composto da musiche orientaleggianti che aumentano di intensità ad ogni rotazione. I tasti presenti sullo schermo scompaiono durante il gioco per riapparire una volta che i rulli sono fermi.\nCaratteristiche di Anubis Wild Megaways\nDi base, la griglia di gioco ha 6 rulli e 5 linee che diventano 6 grazie alla linea extra posta in alto. I simboli possono comparire di diversa grandezza, si va da 2 sino a un massimo di 6. La puntata totale è compresa tra 0,20 € e 20 € e il ritorno teorico al giocatore (RTP) è del 95,9%. Tenendo premuto il tasto Start si possono impostare i giri automatici e alcuni limiti di vincita e di perdita. Attraverso il cursore “Gioco per mancini” la posizione dei rulli viene invertita.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nCominciamo col dire che Anubis Wild Megaways utilizza un metodo a cascata, ossia in seguito a ogni combinazione vincente i simboli paganti scompaiono e vengono rimpiazzati da altri. Tra i simboli con minor valore troviamo le carte da gioco, seguiti dallo scarabeo e da Cleopatra. Il valore aumenta con la sfinge mentre a ricompensare più di tutti è l’occhio di Horus. Il Dio Anubi è il nostro Wild e sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter, qui rappresentato dalla piramide con la scritta Bonus. Il simbolo Wild durante il gioco regolare può apparire solo sul rullo extra. Di tanto in tanto sui rulli può atterrare un simbolo misterioso (un punto interrogativo) che può sostituire un simbolo a caso, tranne quelli speciali. 3 o più  Scatter attivano il gioco Bonus che ricompensa con giri gratuiti, durante i quali il rullo extra scompare. Durante i Free Spins, il simbolo  Wild appare solo sui rulli 2, 3, 4 e 5 e rimane bloccato durante l’intero gioco Bonus. Se viene riempita l’intera griglia di simboli Wild, allora si ha diritto ad altri giri gratuiti. Ogni volta che appare uno Scatter durante il gioco bonus si ottengono 2 ulteriori giri gratuiti, fino a un massimo di 82. Il gioco Bonus può essere anche acquistato. Inoltre, prima di cominciare, viene offerta la possibilità di incrementare il numero di giri gratuiti o di ricevere un misterioso premio in denaro. Bisogna però fare attenzione, perché se si sceglie questa opzione si corre il rischio di perdere l’intero bonus appena acquistato.\n",

When it comes to this setting, it's important to offer interesting ideas for the player. That's exactly what Inspired Gaming did with Anubis Wild Megaways, which, as the title suggests, is inspired by the cult of Anubis, the jackal-headed god who protects cemeteries and the realm of the dead. Cleopatra, the golden scarab, the Eye of Horus, pyramids, and sphinxes are just some of the symbols that take us on a journey into this legendary era. The background on which the reels move is a mortuary room with walls frescoed with numerous hieroglyphics. The sound system features oriental melodies that increase in intensity with each spin. The buttons on the screen disappear during the game and reappear after the reels stop.\n\nFeatures of Anubis Wild Megaways\n\nThe basic game board has 6 reels and 5 lines, which become 6 thanks to the additional line at the top. Symbols can appear in different sizes, ranging from 2 to a maximum of 6. The total bet ranges from €0.20 to €20, and the theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95.9%. By holding down the Start button, players can set automatic spins and certain win and loss limits. Using the \"Left-handed game\" slider, the position of the reels is reversed.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nAnubis Wild Megaways uses a cascade method, which means that after each winning combination, paying symbols disappear and are replaced by others. Among the symbols with less value are the playing cards, followed by the scarab and Cleopatra. The value increases with the sphinx, while the Eye of Horus rewards the most. The God Anubis is our Wild and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the pyramid with the Bonus inscription. The Wild symbol during normal play can only appear on the extra reel. From time to time, a mysterious symbol (a question mark) may land on the reels, replacing a random symbol except the special ones. 3 or more Scatters activate the Bonus game, rewarding free spins during which the extra reel disappears. During Free Spins, the Wild symbol appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and remains locked for the entire Bonus game. If the entire grid is filled with Wild symbols, players are entitled to additional free spins. Every time a Scatter appears during the Bonus game, players get 2 extra free spins, up to a maximum of 82. The Bonus game can also be purchased.

When it comes to this setting, it's important to offer interesting ideas for the player. That's exactly what Inspired Gaming did with Anubis Wild Megaways, which, as the title suggests, is inspired by the cult of Anubis, the jackal-headed god who protects cemeteries and the realm of the dead. Cleopatra, the golden scarab, the Eye of Horus, pyramids, and sphinxes are just some of the symbols that take us on a journey into this legendary era. The background on which the reels move is a mortuary room with walls frescoed with numerous hieroglyphics. The sound system features oriental melodies that increase in intensity with each spin. The buttons on the screen disappear during the game and reappear after the reels stop.\n\nFeatures of Anubis Wild Megaways\n\nThe basic game board has 6 reels and 5 lines, which become 6 thanks to the additional line at the top. Symbols can appear in different sizes, ranging from 2 to a maximum of 6. The total bet ranges from €0.20 to €20, and the theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95.9%. By holding down the Start button, players can set automatic spins and certain win and loss limits. Using the \"Left-handed game\" slider, the position of the reels is reversed.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nAnubis Wild Megaways uses a cascade method, which means that after each winning combination, paying symbols disappear and are replaced by others. Among the symbols with less value are the playing cards, followed by the scarab and Cleopatra. The value increases with the sphinx, while the Eye of Horus rewards the most. The God Anubis is our Wild and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the pyramid with the Bonus inscription. The Wild symbol during normal play can only appear on the extra reel. From time to time, a mysterious symbol (a question mark) may land on the reels, replacing a random symbol except the special ones. 3 or more Scatters activate the Bonus game, rewarding free spins during which the extra reel disappears. During Free Spins, the Wild symbol appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and remains locked for the entire Bonus game. If the entire grid is filled with Wild symbols, players are entitled to additional free spins. Every time a Scatter appears during the Bonus game, players get 2 extra free spins, up to a maximum of 82. The Bonus game can also be purchased. Before starting, players are offered the chance to increase the number of free spins or receive a mysterious cash prize. However, be careful, because choosing this option runs the risk of losing the entire bonus just purchased.\n            ",

The God Anubis acts as the Wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter. Meanwhile, the Scatter symbol features the pyramid with a Bonus inscription. Upon landing three or more scatters anywhere on the grid, players activate the Bonus game, which rewards them with free spins. During the Bonus game, the Wild symbol is locked on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. The Bonus game can alternatively be purchased. Players are given an option to increase the number of free spins or receive a mysterious cash prize before the Bonus game begins.\n\nTheme and Concept\n\nAnubis Wild Megaways is a slot game set in ancient Egypt, following the cult of Anubis, the god of cemeteries and the dead. Symbols prominently featured in the game include Anubis, Cleopatra, scarabs, the Eye of Horus, pyramids, and sphinxes. The background is a mortuary room with hieroglyphics. Sound effects supply an oriental melody that increases in volume with each spin.\n\n        \n            ",

When it comes to this setting, it's important to offer interesting ideas for the player. That's exactly what Inspired Gaming did with Anubis Wild Megaways, which, as the title suggests, is inspired by the cult of Anubis, the jackal-headed god who protects cemeteries and the realm of the dead. Cleopatra, the golden scarab, the Eye of Horus, pyramids, and sphinxes are just some of the symbols that take us on a journey into this legendary era. The background on which the reels move is a mortuary room with walls frescoed with numerous hieroglyphics. The sound system features oriental melodies that increase in intensity with each spin. The buttons on the screen disappear during the game and reappear after the reels stop.\n\nFeatures of Anubis Wild Megaways\n\nThe basic game board has 6 reels and 5 lines, which become 6 thanks to the additional line at the top. Symbols can appear in different sizes, ranging from 2 to a maximum of 6. The total bet ranges from €0.20 to €20, and the theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95.9%. By holding down the Start button, players can set automatic spins and certain win and loss limits. Using the \"Left-handed game\" slider, the position of the reels is reversed.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nAnubis Wild Megaways uses a cascade method, which means that after each winning combination, paying symbols disappear and are replaced by others. Among the symbols with less value are the playing cards, followed by the scarab and Cleopatra. The value increases with the sphinx, while the Eye of Horus rewards the most. The God Anubis is our Wild and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the pyramid with the Bonus inscription. The Wild symbol during normal play can only appear on the extra reel. From time to time, a mysterious symbol (a question mark) may land on the reels, replacing a random symbol except the special ones. 3 or more Scatters activate the Bonus game, rewarding free spins during which the extra reel disappears. During Free Spins, the Wild symbol appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and remains locked for the entire Bonus game. If the entire grid is filled with Wild symbols, players are entitled to additional free spins. Every time a Scatter appears during the Bonus game, players get 2 extra free spins, up to a maximum of 82. The Bonus game can also be purchased. Before starting, players are offered the chance to increase the number of free spins or receive a mysterious cash prize. However, be careful, because choosing this option runs the risk of losing the entire bonus just purchased.\n            ",

From time to time, a mysterious symbol (a question mark) may land on the reels, replacing a random symbol except the special ones. 3 or more Scatters activate the Bonus game, rewarding free spins during which the extra reel disappears. During Free Spins, the Wild symbol appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and remains locked for the entire Bonus game. If the entire grid is filled with Wild symbols, players are entitled to additional free spins. Every time a Scatter appears during the Bonus game, players get 2 extra free spins, up to a maximum of 82. The Bonus game can also be purchased. Before starting, players are offered the chance to increase the number of free spins or receive a mysterious cash prize. However, be careful, because choosing this option runs the risk of losing the entire bonus just purchased.\n            ",

When it comes to this setting, it's important to offer interesting ideas for the player. That's exactly what Inspired Gaming did with Anubis Wild Megaways, which, as the title suggests, is inspired by the cult of Anubis, the jackal-headed god who protects cemeteries and the realm of the dead. Cleopatra, the golden scarab, the Eye of Horus, pyramids, and sphinxes are just some of the symbols that take us on a journey into this legendary era. The background on which the reels move is a mortuary room with walls frescoed with numerous hieroglyphics. The sound system features oriental melodies that increase in intensity with each spin. The buttons on the screen disappear during the game and reappear after the reels stop.\n\nFeatures of Anubis Wild Megaways\n\nThe basic game board has 6 reels and 5 lines, which become 6 thanks to the additional line at the top. Symbols can appear in different sizes, ranging from 2 to a maximum of 6. The total bet ranges from €0.20 to €20, and the theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95.9%. By holding down the Start button, players can set automatic spins and certain win and loss limits. Using the \"Left-handed game\" slider, the position of the reels is reversed.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nAnubis Wild Megaways uses a cascade method, which means that after each winning combination, paying symbols disappear and are replaced by others. Among the symbols with less value are the playing cards, followed by the scarab and Cleopatra. The value increases with the sphinx, while the Eye of Horus rewards the most. The God Anubis is our Wild and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the pyramid with the Bonus inscription. The Wild symbol during normal play can only appear on the extra reel. From time to time, a mysterious symbol (a question mark) may land on the reels, replacing a random symbol except the special ones. 3 or more Scatters activate the Bonus game, rewarding free spins during which the extra reel disappears. During Free Spins, the Wild symbol appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and remains locked for the entire Bonus game. If the entire grid is filled with Wild symbols, players are entitled to additional free spins. Every time a Scatter appears during the Bonus game, players get 2 extra free spins, up to a maximum of 82. The Bonus game can also be purchased. Before starting, players are offered the chance to increase the number of free spins or receive a mysterious cash prize. However, be careful, because choosing this option runs the risk of losing the entire bonus just purchased.\n        ",
