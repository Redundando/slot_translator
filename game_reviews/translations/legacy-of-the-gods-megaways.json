The graphical design uses the theme of ancient Athens and creates symbols of gods and goddesses. Zeus plays a central role, as does Athena. The mysterious symbol is a gold Spartan helmet, and the other symbols are high cards crafted in the ancient Greek alphabet.\n\nLegacy of the Gods Megaways features 6 reels, with each reel capable of holding between 2 and 7 symbols. More symbols on each reel offer more ways to win. If all 6 reels show 7 symbols each, players have 117,649 Megaways. A winning combination is formed when 2 or more matching symbols appear on subsequent reels starting from reel 1. For example, you would need a Zeus symbol in any position on reels 1, 2, and 3 for a payout of 3.\n\nThe game accepts bets from 10 cents to €10 per spin, with an Autoplay function allowing up to 100 auto-spins. Single-session loss limits and single win limits are also available.\n\nIn terms of variance, Legacy of the Gods Megaways falls into the medium-high range, a hallmark of Megaways-style games. The maximum win per spin is 50,000x your bet, which is high, and the total RTP is 96.5%, above average. If you choose to use the Divine Bet function, the RTP goes up to 97.01%.\n\nAs a Blueprint Gaming design, this game features only three buttons on the reel-set. The rotation button is a large, round button that spins the reels when pressed once. Before spinning, however, you may want to check the default bet size, which is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen. To select the bet you want to play on the spin, press the up or down arrow on the left side of the reels, or simply press the circular button and choose from the betting table.\n\nThe Divine Bet button in the lower left corner allows players to purchase the free spins feature. For example, purchasing the bonus on a 10-cent bet will cost €10, while purchasing on the largest bet of €100 costs an exorbitant €1,000.\n\nTo activate Legacy of the Gods Megaways in autoplay mode, press the double arrow button in the bottom right corner. This will open the menu where you can choose between preset automatic spins and optional stop limits, such as stopping on a balance reduction amount or triggering the bonus feature.\n\nSimilar games include Playtech's Age of the Gods, which has 5 reels and 20 paylines. Playable from 20 cents per spin on all devices, this progressive jackpot game features Athena, Hercules, Poseidon, and Zeus. There is a Pantheon of Power On Reels feature where all 5 gods line up to give you a cash prize. However, the main feature is the Age of the Gods Bonus, where you can play one of 4 free spins rounds, each based on the gods, with multipliers up to 5x, up to 5 wilds on each free spin, expanding multipliers, and expanding wilds. This is by far the best slot featuring Greek mythology."

The mysterious symbol is a gold Spartan helmet, and the other symbols are high cards crafted in the ancient Greek alphabet.\n\nLegacy of the Gods Megaways features 6 reels, with each reel capable of holding between 2 and 7 symbols. More symbols on each reel offer more ways to win. If all 6 reels show 7 symbols each, players have 117,649 Megaways. A winning combination is formed when 2 or more matching symbols appear on subsequent reels starting from reel 1. For example, you would need a Zeus symbol in any position on reels 1, 2, and 3 for a payout of 3.\n\nThe game accepts bets from 10 cents to €10 per spin, with an Autoplay function allowing up to 100 auto-spins. Single-session loss limits and single win limits are also available.\n\nIn terms of variance, Legacy of the Gods Megaways falls into the medium-high range, a hallmark of Megaways-style games. The maximum win per spin is 50,000x your bet, which is high, and the total RTP is 96.5%, above average. If you choose to use the Divine Bet function, the RTP goes up to 97.01%.\n\nAs a Blueprint Gaming design, this game features only three buttons on the reel-set. The rotation button is a large, round button that spins the reels when pressed once. Before spinning, however, you may want to check the default bet size, which is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen. To select the bet you want to play on the spin, press the up or down arrow on the left side of the reels, or simply press the circular button and choose from the betting table.\n\nThe Divine Bet button in the lower left corner allows players to purchase the free spins feature. For example, purchasing the bonus on a 10-cent bet will cost €10, while purchasing on the largest bet of €100 costs an exorbitant €1,000.\n\nTo activate Legacy of the Gods Megaways in autoplay mode, press the double arrow button in the bottom right corner. This will open the menu where you can choose between preset automatic spins and optional stop limits, such as stopping on a balance reduction amount or triggering the bonus feature.\n\nSimilar games include Playtech's Age of the Gods, which has 5 reels and 20 paylines. Playable from 20 cents per spin on all devices, this progressive jackpot game features Athena, Hercules, Poseidon, and Zeus. There is a Pantheon of Power On Reels feature where all 5 gods line up to give you a cash prize. However, the main feature is the Age of the Gods Bonus, where you can play one of 4 free spins rounds, each based on the gods, with multipliers up to 5x, up to 5 wilds on each free spin, expanding multipliers, and expanding wilds. This is by far the best slot featuring Greek mythology.\n            ",

Based on the ancient Greek gods, this game offers spins starting at just 10 cents per round on all devices, including mobile phones. It offers cascading symbols, mystery symbols, and a free spins feature where you can choose between 4 options with varying levels of volatility. Each option includes an unlimited win multiplier, and the RTP is 96.5%, with a maximum payout of 50,000 times your bet per spin.\n\nWith its high-definition graphics and epic sound effects, Legacy of the Gods Megaways provides all the extras of a great Megaways adventure. The 6-reel game offers players a dynamic viewing experience on 117,649 max ways to win, with the potential to win up to 10,000x the bet on a winning payline. This is a medium to high variance adventure with an RTP of 96.50%.\n\nThe graphics revolve around the theme of ancient Greek deities, with Mount Olympus as a backdrop. The symbols include the classic Poker card symbols A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9, as well as 4 Greek gods and goddesses: Aphrodite, Athena, Ares, and Zeus. Zeus is the most lucrative symbol, offering 50x your bet for 6 of these symbols in a combination. There is also a temple wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\n\nLegacy of the Gods Megaways is playable on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices as a standard feature, thanks to its HTML5 technology, which offers sharp, colorful graphics that run smoothly on mobile devices. The graphical design uses the theme of ancient Athens and creates symbols of gods and goddesses. Zeus plays a central role, as does Athena. The mysterious symbol is a gold Spartan helmet, and the other symbols are high cards crafted in the ancient Greek alphabet.\n\nLegacy of the Gods Megaways features 6 reels, with each reel capable of holding between 2 and 7 symbols. More symbols on each reel offer more ways to win. If all 6 reels show 7 symbols each, players have 117,649 Megaways. A winning combination is formed when 2 or more matching symbols appear on subsequent reels starting from reel 1. For example, you would need a Zeus symbol in any position on reels 1, 2, and 3 for a payout of 3.\n\nThe game accepts bets from 10 cents to €10 per spin, with an Autoplay function allowing up to 100 auto-spins. Single-session loss limits and single win limits are also available.\n\nIn terms of variance, Legacy of the Gods Megaways falls into the medium-high range, a hallmark of Megaways-style games. The maximum win per spin is 50,000x your bet, which is high, and the total RTP is 96.5%, above average. If you choose to use the Divine Bet function, the RTP goes up to 97.01%.\n\nAs a Blueprint Gaming design, this game features only three buttons on the reel-set. The rotation button is a large, round button that spins the reels when pressed once. Before spinning, however, you may want to check the default bet size, which is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen. To select the bet you want to play on the spin, press the up or down arrow on the left side of the reels, or simply press the circular button and choose from the betting table.\n\nThe Divine Bet button in the lower left corner allows players to purchase the free spins feature. For example, purchasing the bonus on a 10-cent bet will cost €10, while purchasing on the largest bet of €100 costs an exorbitant €1,000.\n\nTo activate Legacy of the Gods Megaways in autoplay mode, press the double arrow button in the bottom right corner. This will open the menu where you can choose between preset automatic spins and optional stop limits, such as stopping on a balance reduction amount or triggering the bonus feature.\n\nSimilar games include Playtech's Age of the Gods, which has 5 reels and 20 paylines. Playable from 20 cents per spin on all devices, this progressive jackpot game features Athena, Hercules, Poseidon, and Zeus. There is a Pantheon of Power On Reels feature where all 5 gods line up to give you a cash prize. However, the main feature is the Age of the Gods Bonus, where you can play one of 4 free spins rounds, each based on the gods, with multipliers up to 5x, up to 5 wilds on each free spin, expanding multipliers, and expanding wilds. This is by far the best slot featuring Greek mythology.\n            ",

Based on the ancient Greek gods, this game offers spins starting at just 10 cents per round on all devices, including mobile phones. It offers cascading symbols, mystery symbols, and a free spins feature where you can choose between 4 options with varying levels of volatility. Each option includes an unlimited win multiplier, and the RTP is 96.5%, with a maximum payout of 50,000 times your bet per spin.\n\nWith its high-definition graphics and epic sound effects, Legacy of the Gods Megaways provides all the extras of a great Megaways adventure. The 6-reel game offers players a dynamic viewing experience on 117,649 max ways to win, with the potential to win up to 10,000x the bet on a winning payline. This is a medium to high variance adventure with an RTP of 96.50%.\n\nThe graphics revolve around the theme of ancient Greek deities, with Mount Olympus as a backdrop. The symbols include the classic Poker card symbols A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9, as well as 4 Greek gods and goddesses: Aphrodite, Athena, Ares, and Zeus. Zeus is the most lucrative symbol, offering 50x your bet for 6 of these symbols in a combination. There is also a temple wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\n\nLegacy of the Gods Megaways is playable on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices as a standard feature, thanks to its HTML5 technology, which offers sharp, colorful graphics that run smoothly on mobile devices. The graphical design uses the theme of ancient Athens and creates symbols of gods and goddesses. Zeus plays a central role, as does Athena. The mysterious symbol is a gold Spartan helmet, and the other symbols are high cards crafted in the ancient Greek alphabet.\n\nLegacy of the Gods Megaways features 6 reels, with each reel capable of holding between 2 and 7 symbols. More symbols on each reel offer more ways to win. If all 6 reels show 7 symbols each, players have 117,649 Megaways. A winning combination is formed when 2 or more matching symbols appear on subsequent reels starting from reel 1. For example, you would need a Zeus symbol in any position on reels 1, 2, and 3 for a payout of 3.\n\nThe game accepts bets from 10 cents to €10 per spin, with an Autoplay function allowing up to 100 auto-spins. Single-session loss limits and single win limits are also available.\n\nIn terms of variance, Legacy of the Gods Megaways falls into the medium-high range, a hallmark of Megaways-style games. The maximum win per spin is 50,000x your bet, which is high, and the total RTP is 96.5%, above average. If you choose to use the Divine Bet function, the RTP goes up to 97.01%.\n\nAs a Blueprint Gaming design, this game features only three buttons on the reel-set. The rotation button is a large, round button that spins the reels when pressed once. Before spinning, however, you may want to check the default bet size, which is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen. To select the bet you want to play on the spin, press the up or down arrow on the left side of the reels, or simply press the circular button and choose from the betting table.\n\nThe Divine Bet button in the lower left corner allows players to purchase the free spins feature. For example, purchasing the bonus on a 10-cent bet will cost €10, while purchasing on the largest bet of €100 costs an exorbitant €1,000.\n\nTo activate Legacy of the Gods Megaways in autoplay mode, press the double arrow button in the bottom right corner. This will open the menu where you can choose between preset automatic spins and optional stop limits, such as stopping on a balance reduction amount or triggering the bonus feature.\n\nSimilar games include Playtech's Age of the Gods, which has 5 reels and 20 paylines. Playable from 20 cents per spin on all devices, this progressive jackpot game features Athena, Hercules, Poseidon, and Zeus. There is a Pantheon of Power On Reels feature where all 5 gods line up to give you a cash prize. However, the main feature is the Age of the Gods Bonus, where you can play one of 4 free spins rounds, each based on the gods, with multipliers up to 5x, up to 5 wilds on each free spin, expanding multipliers, and expanding wilds. This is by far the best slot featuring Greek mythology.\n            ",
