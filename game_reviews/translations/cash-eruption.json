You'll see fireball symbols, each with a cash value on any spin. If six or more land at once, they lock in place for an initial three reel respins. Every other fireball in a respin resets the counter to three and also locks in on the reels.\n\nThis continues until there are no more respins left, or all 15 positions are filled with fireballs, after which you claim all the combined values in sight. Land fireball symbols with Mini, Minor, or Major jackpots on them to win the corresponding prize. These are small jackpots, worth 5x, 25x, and 100x your bet, so the Grand Treasure prize is what you want.\n\nFill all 15 spots of the Online Cash Eruption slot with fireballs, and win all the combined values plus the fixed Grand Treasure jackpot of €10,000.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nUseful fire symbols as wild icons rain down on the reels of NextGen Gaming's Volcano Eruption Extreme slot. It's a five-reel, 25-line game where a volcano comes to life, adding wild symbols in one of the various features.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay features\nJackpot prizes\nBonus rounds\nFree spin round\nExpanding wild symbols\nMaximum win potential\nTheme and graphics\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Cash Eruption\n\nDeep within an Aztec temple lies the Cash Eruption slot machine, waiting to explode with prizes and fill your bankroll with riches. Traditional fruit-themed symbols appear alongside a beautiful Fire Goddess and fireballs that trigger a respins bonus round.\n\nDuring this feature in the Online Cash Eruption slot, you can uncover any of the four jackpots, including the Grand Treasure prize. Other fiery features include expanding wild symbols and a free spin with giant symbols that fill the central reels.\n\nThe wins in this fantastic IGT slot game can reach up to 1,000x your total bet.\n\nA mix of standard fruit symbols and exotic high-yield imagery awaits you in Cash Eruption, a slot machine based on erupting volcanoes to bring truly precious wins but otherwise sticking to a classic theme that we are all familiar with. It is one of IGT's slots for 2020, featuring good graphics and a couple of features that should make it interesting.\n\nExplosive Graphics\n\nCash Eruption offers 5x3 reels with 20 lines, roughly the most common layout you can think of. The slot offers pattern wins that can bring jackpots up to 1,000x the wager, as well as scatters, free spins, linked jumbo symbols, expanding wilds, and a Cash Eruption Bonus. A 96% RTP is possible, though since the developer allows IGT-powered online casinos to choose within a range, it can also be up to 93.10%.\n\nIt's an unusual mix of standard fruit symbols and exotic high-yield imagery. Cherries, watermelons, and lemons share space with traditional bell symbols and red 7s. The stunning fire goddess is a detailed image of an Aztec woman wearing a bikini top and a golden crown.\n\nEverything is set inside a stone temple, where the glow of a volcanic eruption is reflected on the walls. A lively melody plays along, and although it is very catchy, we're not sure it completely fits the style of an Aztec-themed slot machine.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nHowever, as soon as you start playing the Online Cash Eruption slot, you forget about any style clash. It's an easy and exciting game from popular IGT developer, with some exciting bonuses and excellent winning potential.\n\nIt might start with a volcano eruption theme, one in which the jungle queen is the wild, fireballs are used as scatters, and volcanoes act as triggers for free spins, but in the end, you still end up with a classic fruit theme.\n\nAlthough it doesn't directly pay prizes, the Fire Goddess is a wild symbol that acts like any other, stepping in when needed to complete winning lines. If it can create a win, the Fire Goddess becomes an expanding wild symbol that fills entire reels at once.\n\nLand red number 7 symbols and the Fire Goddess in all 15 positions of the Cash Eruption online slot symbols to win a 1000x total bet bonus prize.\n\nEvery three, four, or five volcano scatter symbols pay out 2x, 15x, or 100x your total bet before launching six free spins. In every bonus game, the three middle reels are filled with a random super-sized symbol. Land the same symbol on one reel for four guaranteed wins of a kind, or on the rightmost reel at the same time for a full line.\n\nA different paytable applies throughout the round, so you can win more often, but aside from the 7s, the maximum wins are reduced.\n\nThe Cash Eruption slot machine has a respins bonus round. You'll see fireball symbols, each with a cash value on any spin. If six or more land at once, they lock in place for an initial three reel respins. Every other fireball in a respin resets the counter to three and also locks in on the reels.\n\nThis continues until there are no more respins left, or all 15 positions are filled with fireballs, after which you claim all the combined values in sight. Land fireball symbols with Mini, Minor, or Major jackpots on them to win the corresponding prize. These are small jackpots, worth 5x, 25x, and 100x your bet, so the Grand Treasure prize is what you want.\n\nFill all 15 spots of the Online Cash Eruption slot with fireballs, and win all the combined values plus the fixed Grand Treasure jackpot of €10,000.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nUseful fire symbols as wild icons rain down on the reels of NextGen Gaming's Volcano Eruption Extreme slot. It's a five-reel, 25-line game where a volcano comes to life, adding wild symbols in one of the various features. Other bonuses include respins with wilds locked on the central reel.\n\nYou can win a huge progressive jackpot when playing Playtech's Jackpot Giant slot. A cartoon giant oversees the action on five reels and 50 paylines. It comes with a pick-a-volcano spin, and if you land five wilds on the first line, you win the progressive prize.\n            ",

The slot offers pattern wins that can bring jackpots up to 1,000x the wager, as well as scatters, free spins, linked jumbo symbols, expanding wilds, and a Cash Eruption bonus.\n\nJackpot Prizes\n\nCash Eruption offers four jackpots: Mini, Minor, Major, and Grand Treasure. The Grand Treasure prize is a fixed jackpot worth €10,000, which can be won by filling all the 15 spots of the online Cash Eruption slot with fireballs.\n\nBonus Rounds\n\nThe Cash Eruption slot machine has two bonus rounds: respins bonus round and a free spin round with giant symbols. During the respins bonus round, fireball symbols appear, and if six or more land at once, they lock in place for an initial three reel respins, with every other fireball resetting the counter to three and also locking onto the reels. This continues until there are no more respins left, or all 15 positions are filled with fireballs. During the free spin round, the three middle reels are filled with a random super-sized symbol. Land the same symbol on one reel for four guaranteed wins of a kind, or on the rightmost reel at the same time for a full line.\n\nExpanding Wild Symbols\n\nAlthough it doesn't directly pay prizes, the Fire Goddess is a wild symbol that acts like any other, stepping in when needed to complete winning lines. If it can create a win, the Fire Goddess becomes an expanding wild symbol that fills entire reels at once.\n\nFree Spin Round\n\nIn the Cash Eruption free spin round, three middle reels are filled with a random super-sized symbol. Land the same symbol on one reel for four guaranteed wins of a kind or on the rightmost reel at the same time for a full line. A different paytable applies throughout the round, so you can win more often, but aside from the 7s, the maximum wins are reduced.\n\nMaximum Win Potential\n\nThe maximum win in the Cash Eruption slot game can reach up to 1,000x your total bet, which can be won by landing red number 7 symbols and the Fire Goddess in all 15 positions.\n\nTheme and Visuals\n\nCash Eruption is an Aztec-themed slot game that features fruits, a Fire Goddess, and fireballs. The stunning fire goddess is a detailed image of an Aztec woman wearing a bikini top and a golden crown. Everything is set inside a stone temple, where the glow of a volcanic eruption is reflected on the walls.\n\n        \n            ",

The game offers expanding wild symbols, linked jumbo symbols, free spins, scatters, and a Cash Eruption Bonus that can uncover any of four jackpots.\n\nJackpot prizes\n\nCash Eruption has four jackpots, including the Grand Treasure prize worth €10,000. You can win smaller jackpots - Mini, Minor, and Major - by landing fireball symbols with those jackpot prizes in the Cash Eruption Bonus round. Fill all 15 positions with fireballs to win all the combined values and the Grand Treasure prize.\n\nBonus rounds\n\nCash Eruption has two bonus rounds: a Cash Eruption Bonus and a free spins round. In the Cash Eruption Bonus, you can win any of four jackpots, including the Grand Treasure prize, by landing fireball symbols. Six or more fireball symbols trigger a respins feature that locks symbols in place for three respins. Every other symbol that lands locks in place too, and you win all the cash values in sight when you run out of respins or fill all 15 spots with fireballs. In the free spins round, every spin has a super-sized symbol on the central reels for more guaranteed wins.\n\nFree spin round\n\nWhen three or more volcano scatter symbols land on the reels, you trigger the free spins round in Cash Eruption. You get six free spins, and during every spin, a super-sized symbol appears on the central reels. Land the same symbol on one of the three central reels for four guaranteed wins of that symbol in a row. Land the same symbol on the rightmost reel too, and you get a full line of wins. A different paytable applies during free spins for more frequent wins.\n\nExpanding wild symbols\n\nThe Fire Goddess is a wild symbol in Cash Eruption that substitutes for any symbol except for the volcano scatter and fireball symbols. When the Fire Goddess can complete a winning line, she expands to fill the entire reel. This can lead to more wins in a single spin.\n\nMaximum win potential\n\nCash Eruption has a maximum win potential of up to 1,000x your total bet. You can win this prize by landing the Fire Goddess in all 15 positions and the red number 7 symbol on the reels. In the Cash Eruption Bonus round, you can win up to 100x your total bet from the Mini, Minor, and Major jackpots, or the Grand Treasure prize worth €10,000. Fill all 15 positions with fireball symbols to win all the combined values plus the Grand Treasure jackpot.\n\nTheme and graphics\n\nCash Eruption is an Aztec-themed slot machine game featuring a mix of standard fruit symbols and exotic high-yield imagery. The game is set inside an Aztec temple, where the glow of a volcanic eruption is reflected on the walls. The fire goddess symbol is a detailed image of an Aztec woman wearing a golden crown. The graphics are good, and the catchy melody adds to the excitement of the game.\n\n        \n            ",

Traditional fruit-themed symbols appear alongside a beautiful Fire Goddess and fireballs that trigger a respins bonus round.\n\nDuring this feature in the Online Cash Eruption slot, you can uncover any of the four jackpots, including the Grand Treasure prize. Other fiery features include expanding wild symbols and a free spin with giant symbols that fill the central reels.\n\nThe wins in this fantastic IGT slot game can reach up to 1,000x your total bet.\n\nA mix of standard fruit symbols and exotic high-yield imagery awaits you in Cash Eruption, a slot machine based on erupting volcanoes to bring truly precious wins but otherwise sticking to a classic theme that we are all familiar with. It is one of IGT's slots for 2020, featuring good graphics and a couple of features that should make it interesting.\n\nExplosive Graphics\n\nCash Eruption offers 5x3 reels with 20 lines, roughly the most common layout you can think of. The slot offers pattern wins that can bring jackpots up to 1,000x the wager, as well as scatters, free spins, linked jumbo symbols, expanding wilds, and a Cash Eruption Bonus. A 96% RTP is possible, though since the developer allows IGT-powered online casinos to choose within a range, it can also be up to 93.10%.\n\nIt's an unusual mix of standard fruit symbols and exotic high-yield imagery. Cherries, watermelons, and lemons share space with traditional bell symbols and red 7s. The stunning fire goddess is a detailed image of an Aztec woman wearing a bikini top and a golden crown.\n\nEverything is set inside a stone temple, where the glow of a volcanic eruption is reflected on the walls. A lively melody plays along, and although it is very catchy, we're not sure it completely fits the style of an Aztec-themed slot machine.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nHowever, as soon as you start playing the Online Cash Eruption slot, you forget about any style clash. It's an easy and exciting game from popular IGT developer, with some exciting bonuses and excellent winning potential.\n\nIt might start with a volcano eruption theme, one in which the jungle queen is the wild, fireballs are used as scatters, and volcanoes act as triggers for free spins, but in the end, you still end up with a classic fruit theme.\n\nAlthough it doesn't directly pay prizes, the Fire Goddess is a wild symbol that acts like any other, stepping in when needed to complete winning lines. If it can create a win, the Fire Goddess becomes an expanding wild symbol that fills entire reels at once.\n\nLand red number 7 symbols and the Fire Goddess in all 15 positions of the Cash Eruption online slot symbols to win a 1000x total bet bonus prize.\n\nEvery three, four, or five volcano scatter symbols pay out 2x, 15x, or 100x your total bet before launching six free spins. In every bonus game, the three middle reels are filled with a random super-sized symbol. Land the same symbol on one reel for four guaranteed wins of a kind, or on the rightmost reel at the same time for a full line.\n\nA different paytable applies throughout the round, so you can win more often, but aside from the 7s, the maximum wins are reduced.\n\nThe Cash Eruption slot machine has a respins bonus round. You'll see fireball symbols, each with a cash value on any spin. If six or more land at once, they lock in place for an initial three reel respins. Every other fireball in a respin resets the counter to three and also locks in on the reels.\n\nThis continues until there are no more respins left, or all 15 positions are filled with fireballs, after which you claim all the combined values in sight. Land fireball symbols with Mini, Minor, or Major jackpots on them to win the corresponding prize. These are small jackpots, worth 5x, 25x, and 100x your bet, so the Grand Treasure prize is what you want.\n\nFill all 15 spots of the Online Cash Eruption slot with fireballs, and win all the combined values plus the fixed Grand Treasure jackpot of €10,000.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nUseful fire symbols as wild icons rain down on the reels of NextGen Gaming's Volcano Eruption Extreme slot. It's a five-reel, 25-line game where a volcano comes to life, adding wild symbols in one of the various features. Other bonuses include respins with wilds locked on the central reel.\n\nYou can win a huge progressive jackpot when playing Playtech's Jackpot Giant slot. A cartoon giant oversees the action on five reels and 50 paylines. It comes with a pick-a-volcano spin, and if you land five wilds on the first line, you win the progressive prize.\n            ",

You'll see fireball symbols, each with a cash value on any spin. If six or more land at once, they lock in place for an initial three reel respins. Every other fireball in a respin resets the counter to three and also locks in on the reels.\n\nThis continues until there are no more respins left, or all 15 positions are filled with fireballs, after which you claim all the combined values in sight. Land fireball symbols with Mini, Minor, or Major jackpots on them to win the corresponding prize. These are small jackpots, worth 5x, 25x, and 100x your bet, so the Grand Treasure prize is what you want.\n\nFill all 15 spots of the Online Cash Eruption slot with fireballs, and win all the combined values plus the fixed Grand Treasure jackpot of €10,000.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nUseful fire symbols as wild icons rain down on the reels of NextGen Gaming's Volcano Eruption Extreme slot. It's a five-reel, 25-line game where a volcano comes to life, adding wild symbols in one of the various features.

A cartoon giant oversees the action on five reels and 50 paylines. It comes with a pick-a-volcano spin, and if you land five wilds on the first line, you win the progressive prize.\n        ",
