The game offers 6 reels and 4 lines where symbols alternate to recreate the times of the past. The graphics are innovative, yet they maintain the image of ancient Greece. The animations on the reels are surprising, which makes it stand out. Mythological Mayhem has 4 dimensions: the Elysian Plains, the Depths of Tartarus, the sea of Poseidon, and the Heavens of Olympus.\n\nWhen the player is in the base game, it is possible to take advantage of the figure of Apollo to advance to the next step. At that point, a line on the grid increases and there are new symbols that include Hades and the Minotaur. In this phase, winning symbols cascade and the player is taken on a further journey to the deep sea. In this case, there are extra remunerative symbols such as Medusa and Poseidon. If additional wins are obtained, the player can finally reach Mount Olympus, where they have 117,649 ways to win.\n\nOverall, we are in front of a decent slot game that offers many entertainment solutions. Its winning structure is positive, the features are interesting, and it offers up to 10,000 times your bet.\n        ",

While the theme may not be the most innovative, this online slot has a range of pleasing features that make it stand out. Structurally, it offers 6 reels and 4 lines where symbols alternate to recreate the times of the past. But let's explore the advantages of this slot!\n\nGraphics of the Mythological Mayhem slot\n\nWe are in Olympus, in a perfectly crafted graphic universe created by the provider, which places us before Poseidon, in the true ascent to Mount Olympus. The graphics are innovative, while trying to maintain a fairly standard image of ancient Greece. The animations on the reels are surprising, thanks to both the cascading symbols and consecutive wins that lead to a potential that is increasingly rich in emotions. And, of course, in money!\n\nThe most enjoyable part of this online slot? On Mythological Mayhem, we have 4 dimensions: the Elysian Plains, the Depths of Tartarus, the sea of Poseidon and the Heavens of Olympus.\n\nGame Features and Functions\n\nWhen the player is in the base game, it will be possible to take advantage of the figure of Apollo to advance to the next step, with a function that takes us into the world with the flames of Tartarus. At that point, a line on the grid increases and there are new symbols that include Hades and the Minotaur. In this phase, winning symbols cascade and the player is taken on a further journey to the deep sea.\n\nIn this case, there are extra remunerative symbols such as Medusa and Poseidon. If additional wins are obtained, the player can finally reach Mount Olympus, where they have 117,649 ways to win.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Mythological Mayhem slot\n\nOverall, we are in front of a decent slot game that offers many entertainment solutions and never disappoints the player. Its winning structure is positive, the features are interesting and it offers up to 10,000 times your bet.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nDoes the Mythological Mayhem slot game have a good RTP?\n\nIts RTP is set at 94.8%, which is slightly below the industry average.\n\nWhat is the maximum win offered by Mythological Mayhem?\n\nThis slot machine has a potential win of up to 10,000 times the bet.\n\nIs it possible to try the game for free at an online casino?\n\nYes, simply choose the demo version on our website or at the best licensed casinos.\n            ",
