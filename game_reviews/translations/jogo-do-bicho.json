Il gioco, che nonostante sia stato dichiarato illegale, è ampiamente giocato su tutto il territorio brasiliano, in cui gli appassionati devono scommettere sui numeri, divisi in 25 gruppi e con ciascun gruppo rappresentato da un animale.\nLa slot machine di casa Skywind è ambientata in una giungla popolata da tanti animali riprodotti in stile cartone animato. Il compartimento grafico è sì carino ma lontano dalle slot machine ipertecnologiche con grafiche realiste e tridimensionali che abbiamo visto negli ultimi anni: Jogo Do Bicho è un gioco semplice ma ben curato e che regala un’esperienza di gioco del tutto soddisfacente sia ai giocatori più esperti sia da coloro che stanno provando per le prime volte a far girare i rulli.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nJogo Do Bicho è una slot machine che presenta una griglia di gioco costituita dai tradizionali cinque rulli per tre righe e che permette di puntare su 30 linee di pagamento.\nSulla parte inferiore della schermata si trovano i tasti per il settaggio del gioco che includono anche quello per aumentare o diminuire il valore del gettone: il range di scommesse di Jogo Do Bicho va da un minimo di 0,3 fino a un massimo di 150 crediti per giro.\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore (RTP) di questa slot machine si attesta sul 95%, poco soddisfacente se comparato sia alle altre slot dello stesso provider, sia alla media dei giochi di slot in generale.\nPer quanto riguarda la varianza, Jogo Do Bicho è un gioco caratterizzato da un’alta volatilità: ciò significa che se sarete fortunati e saprete attendere, potrete aspettarvi anche delle vincite di una certo valore.\nSimboli e funzionalità speciali di Jogo Do Bicho\nLa Skywind Group ci ha abituati a giochi molto interessanti dal punto di vista del gameplay e anche Jogo Do Bicho presenta alcune funzionalità che lo rendono avvincente.\nI simboli che troviamo sui rulli sono interamente tematici e dedicati agli animali della giungla: abbiamo il leone, il toro, l’uccello, la tigre, il coccodrillo, l’orso, il pavone, la scimmia, il cervo, il maiale, la capra, il coniglio e il pollo.\nLa cosa più interessante di Jogo Do Bicho è rappresentata dalla “Ruota degli animali”, che si attiva durante il gioco in maniera del tutto casuale: a ogni animale corrisponde una funzione speciale che si attiverà ogni qualvolta quell’animale comparirà sulla ruota. Ad esempio ,se sulla ruota compare il leone si attiverà una funzione speciale chiamata “Lion Roar Respin”.\nEsiste poi una funzione chiama “Bingo Game” alla quale su può accedere sia quando il coccodrillo compare sulla ruota, sia quando sui rulli appaiono tre simboli bonus, e che funziona grossomodo come il gioco brasiliano Jogo Do Bicho a cui la slot si ispira.\n",

Although it may not be among the big providers, Skywind Group has created very entertaining and unique slot games, with gameplay rich in bonus games and special features. \n\nThe theme of this slot machine is a fun take on a popular Brazilian gambling game called Jogo Do Bicho, in which players bet on numbers divided into 25 groups, each group represented by an animal. Despite being declared illegal, the game is widely played throughout Brazil. \n\nThe Skywind slot machine is set in a jungle populated by many animals depicted in a cartoon style. While graphics may not be the most high-tech and realistic that we have seen in recent years, Jogo Do Bicho is a well-executed yet simple game that guarantees a satisfying gaming experience for both experienced players and novices. \n\nThe slot machine features a five-reel, three-row game grid, with 30 paylines available for betting. The game also includes buttons for setting up the game and increasing or decreasing the token value. The range of bets for Jogo Do Bicho goes from a minimum of 0.3 to a maximum of 150 credits per spin. \n\nThe game's RTP stands at 95%, which may not be as high as other slots from the same provider, let alone the average for slot games in general. However, Jogo Do Bicho is a game characterized by high volatility, meaning that if you're lucky and patient, you can expect some big wins. \n\nThe symbols on the reels are all thematic, featuring jungle animals such as the lion, bull, bird, tiger, crocodile, bear, peacock, monkey, deer, pig, goat, rabbit, and chicken. The most interesting feature of Jogo Do Bicho is the \"Wheel of animals\", which activates randomly during the game. Each animal corresponds to a special function that activates whenever that animal appears on the wheel. For example, if the lion appears on the wheel, a special function called \"Lion Roar Respin\" will activate. \n\nThere is also a feature called \"Bingo Game\", which can be accessed when either the crocodile appears on the wheel or three bonus symbols appear on the reels. This function works similarly to the Brazilian gambling game, Jogo Do Bicho, on which the slot game is based. \n\nOverall, Jogo Do Bicho is a well-designed slot machine that provides an exciting and satisfying gaming experience for both experienced and novice gamblers alike.",

Although the software provider may not rank among the big names in the industry, it has surely set the bar high when it comes to creating fun and unique slot games, packed with bonus features and special functionalities.\n\nThe theme of this slot game, which is pretty impressive at first glance, pays tribute to one of Brazil's most popular gambling games - Jogo Do Bicho. Although the game has been declared illegal, it still enjoys a massive following across Brazil where players bet on numbers divided into 25 groups, each represented by an animal. \n\nSet in a jungle inhabited by cartoonish animals, this slot machine offers a nice graphic blend, albeit far from the high-tech reels featuring realistic 3D graphics that we have gotten used to in recent years.

The range of bets in Jogo Do Bicho lies between a minimum of 0.3 credits and a maximum of 150 credits per spin. The Return to Player (RTP) percentage for this slot machine is 95%, which falls slightly short compared to other slots from the same software provider and the average for slot games.\n\nRegarding variance, Jogo Do Bicho has high volatility- meaning that with some luck and patience, players can expect to land some substantial wins.

And let's not forget the 'Bingo Game' feature, triggered by the crocodile symbol or when three bonus symbols land on the reels. It's not really like animal bingo, but more like a Brazilian game of Jogo Do Bicho - with a slot machine spin (literally)!</p>\"\n}"

Although the software provider may not rank among the big names in the industry, it has surely set the bar high when it comes to creating fun and unique slot games, packed with bonus features and special functionalities.\n\nThe theme of this slot game, which is pretty impressive at first glance, pays tribute to one of Brazil's most popular gambling games - Jogo Do Bicho. Although the game has been declared illegal, it still enjoys a massive following across Brazil where players bet on numbers divided into 25 groups, each represented by an animal. \n\nSet in a jungle inhabited by cartoonish animals, this slot machine offers a nice graphic blend, albeit far from the high-tech reels featuring realistic 3D graphics that we have gotten used to in recent years. Jogo Do Bicho offers a simple yet well-crafted gaming experience that's highly satisfying for both experienced and novice players.\n\nThe slot machine features a 5x3 grid and offers 30 pay lines, and players can adjust their bets using the bottom row of settings buttons. The range of bets in Jogo Do Bicho lies between a minimum of 0.3 credits and a maximum of 150 credits per spin. The Return to Player (RTP) percentage for this slot machine is 95%, which falls slightly short compared to other slots from the same software provider and the average for slot games.\n\nRegarding variance, Jogo Do Bicho has high volatility- meaning that with some luck and patience, players can expect to land some substantial wins. The symbols on the reels are entirely thematic and dedicated to jungle animals, including lions, bulls, birds, tigers, crocodiles, bears, peacocks, monkeys, deer, pigs, goats, rabbits, and chickens.\n\nOne unique feature that sets Jogo Do Bicho apart is the \"Animal Wheel,\" which activates randomly during gameplay. Each animal on the wheel has an associated special function that activates when that animal symbol lands on the reels. For example, when the lion symbol appears on the wheel, it activates the 'Lion Roar Respin' feature. Additionally, there is another feature called \"Bingo Game\" that players can access when they land the crocodile symbol on the reels or when three bonus symbols appear, reminiscent of the Brazilian game Jogo Do Bicho that this slot machine draws inspiration. \n\nOverall, Jogo Do Bicho is an exciting and highly engaging slot machine that delivers an enthralling gaming experience to experienced gamblers.\n            ",
