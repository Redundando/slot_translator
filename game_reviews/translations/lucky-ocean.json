No, we're not talking about The Little Mermaid, but the setting of the Lucky Ocean online slot machine conveys the same vibes. Onlyplay, the provider, launched this product on the market in June 2020, playing around with a new mode of casino slot machines. Yes, because Lucky Ocean is not everything you could expect from a slot. But that's precisely why it deserves to be tried!\n\nYou will be amazed by its instant lottery mechanics, which have been one of the primary requests of players who approach the online gaming market for some time now. To better understand how it works, we invite you to read our review and get into the heart of this game, which features a structure of 4 reels, 7 lines, and an RTP of 96.2%.\n\nThe Graphics of the Lucky Ocean Slot Machine\nAesthetically, the software house that created this machine has done an excellent job: the game grid is positioned in the middle of a fantastic underwater scene. Here we find the bright colors of the sea, the cartoon-style corals. The sound that accompanies the game adventure is relaxing, but you could expect something more particular to align it with the chosen theme.\n\nThe player who starts his adventure will have to manually create his interaction with the 7 lines in front of him. Each row is composed of bubbles, hiding a Pearl inside. Choose the position of the lucky symbol and move on to the upper line, thus unlocking a growing jackpot. But beware: if you fail to find the Pearl, but come across the Porcupine Fish, you will lose the collected and unredeemed loot, and you will have to start over.\n\nWith this straightforward mechanism, the player can take the risk of increasing the value of the line winnings, or cashing out the winnings. However, it is certain that the winnings will depend solely on the choices made personally. As you can see, there are no special features, but it is precisely the essence of the game that makes it intuitive and enjoyable.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Lucky Ocean\nIt is difficult not to be surprised by Lucky Ocean: the slot offers interesting winnings that really depend on your luck and gaming choices. All you have to do is decide the amount of your bet and select the bubbles behind which the Pearl is hidden. In this way, you can dare for a while, trying to reach the Big Win and maybe try to stop halfway and collect the winnings to pile up money.\n\nThe choice of this design, the ease of understanding the rules and the absence of extra features make this slot one of the most enjoyable for new players. Let yourself be guided by your sixth sense and start your ascent to the surface. Therefore, try to evaluate your gaming style and try to understand if a Big Win achieved with a doubling is enough to satisfy its entertainment level thanks to this title.\n            ",

The game has 4 reels, 7 lines, and an RTP of 96.2%. The player has to manually choose the position of the lucky symbol and move on to the upper line to unlock a growing jackpot.

The player can choose to cash out the winnings or take the risk of increasing the value of the line winnings to try and reach the Big Win, however, finding the Porcupine Fish instead of the Pearl results in losing all the collected and unredeemed loot.\n\n        \n            ",
