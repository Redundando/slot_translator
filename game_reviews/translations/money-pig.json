The game has an easily customizable gameplay that offers up to 15 winning lines and a maximum coin value of 150. The game has a direct function, making it easy for new players.\n\nGameplay and features\n\nMoney Pig is a 5*3 grid slot game with 15 symbols. The slot has symbols representing various wealth features like diamonds, banknotes, and rings, and the lower value winnings have neon signs representing the common playing cards. The slot has two special symbols, one of which is a piglet of a piggy bank symbol, which acts as a Wild symbol and can replace all other symbols in the game except for the other special symbol, represented by the title of the slot itself, which appears as a Scatter symbol that can give access to the bonus mode. The bonus mode requires the player to choose a gem, and they will then get a random winning associated with it.\n\nAesthetics and symbols\n\nMoney Pig is a gold and purple-themed online slot game that represents opulence and wealth. The game opens with a captivating atmospheric music that does not become annoying during gameplay, but players have the option to disable it. The symbols that decorate the grid represent wealth in all its forms, from diamonds (the highest value symbol) to the pig token, banknotes, and the ring. The game also has four symbols representing playing cards (A, K, Q, and J) which are neon signs, giving them a modern look in line with the theme.\n\nSpecial symbols\n\nMoney Pig has two special symbols, which include the piggy bank piglet symbol and the title of the slot symbol. The piggy bank piglet is a Wild symbol that can replace all symbols in the game except for the other special symbol, represented by the title of the slot itself, which appears as a Scatter symbol and gives access to the bonus mode.\n\nSimilar slot games\n\nFor players that enjoy Capecod's titles, it is advisable to try out other slots by the same development company, such as Bomber Fruit Slot, which features a classic fruit-themed game, or The Bounty Pirates, which offers an exciting theme. Other similar games include Smash The Pig by G2 Spielo, which also features a pig as its main symbol.\n\n        \n            ",

One example is Money Pig, a title by Capecod that revolves around two elements: wealth and the animal that wastes nothing.\nIn this review, we will examine its purely aesthetic and technical aspects, in order to offer a more complete picture to potential players.\nMoney Pig: graphic analysis\nLet's start with the most immediate aspect in our evaluation: the visual one. The slot opens with a delicate but captivating atmospheric music, which does not become annoying during the game, although it is possible to disable it among the options.\nThe symbols that crowd the game grid represent the various faces of wealth, ranging from the diamond (the symbol with the highest value) to the pig token, banknotes and the ring. In addition, there are other 4 symbols very common in slot machines, namely those of the playing cards (A, K, Q and J). These, representing the winnings of the lower value, are represented as neon signs, giving them a more modern look in line with the theme.\nIn addition to the token, the symbols related to the pig mentioned in the title are reserved for special functions, which we will discuss in the next point in the review.\nFinally, the colors of the slot are gold and purple, both symbols of opulence, which do not strain the eyes during the various plays.\nMoney Pig: how to play?\nLet's move on to the more technical analysis: we are facing a 5*3 game grid, with five reels that spin on themselves and stop along three horizontal lines. If mathematics isn't an opinion, the result of this intersection is the fifteen symbols displayed at each game.\nThe player can customize their gameplay by changing the number of winning lines and the value in coins of each coin along such lines, going from a minimum value of 1 to a maximum value of 150.\nThe winning lines, in fact, reach a maximum value of 15, rather few compared to normal online standards, which leads to having a lower number of winnings but with a higher value.\nThe special symbols we mentioned before are two: the piggy bank piglet is a Wild symbol that can replace all the others in the game (except the other special one), and the title of the slot itself appears as a Scatter symbol that can give access to the bonus mode in which the player will have to choose a gem and will get a random winning associated with it.\nThe slot machine therefore has a rather direct functioning and is easy to understand, even for players less accustomed to this world.\nSimilar titles to Money Pig\nSince this is one of Capecod's titles, it is advisable to try out the other slots by this development company, such as Bomber Fruit Slot for those looking for the classic fruit-themed game in their game or The Bounty Pirates for those who want some extra excitement during their game.\nMoreover, the pig is not an animal particularly distant from the world of slot machines, precisely because of its resemblance to certain piggy banks: for this reason, we also recommend the slot Smash The Pig by G2 Spielo.\n        ",
