As soon as you open the main screen, you are faced with a wooden cabin, with a red armchair in front of the lit fireplace, a large tree decorated with multicolored lights and a mountain of gifts. If we had to guess, we'd say we're inside Santa's house. The graphics in general recall Santa Claus, starting with the symbols: playing cards inside colored balls, reindeer, teddy bears, bells, snowflakes, and of course, Santa Claus himself.\n\nEngaging Features of Let It Spin\nThe game grid consists of 6 reels and 4 rows, 30 fixed pay lines, and a maximum win of 2,500 times the bet for a minimum cost of €0.30 per spin. To win, you need to create combos of identical symbols on a pay line, starting from the left reel and moving to the right.\n\nOne of the various options available is automatic spins that stop when certain limits of winnings or losses are reached, and Turbo, which accelerates reel rotation for faster spins. The volatility is medium, while the RTP value stands at a good 95%.\n\nA Glimpse of Bonus Features\nThe symbols that land on the reels can be divided into some of low value and others that are more rewarding. The playing cards belong to the first group, while the golden bell, reindeer, teddy bears, and Santa Claus are considered premium symbols.\n\nSpecial symbols include Wild and Scatter. The former has the function of a wild card and replaces all symbols except the Scatter in a paying combo. The Scatter is represented by a snowflake, and the number that lands on the reels rewards us with a number of free spins ranging from 8 to 20. Remember that the Bonus Game can be purchased at a cost of 70x the bet.\n\nThere are also two randomly activated special functions introduced by Santa Claus's classic \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" In the first, a cold gust that enters through the window behind the grid will deposit up to a maximum of 20 Wild symbols.\n\nThe Bursting Wild feature ensures that the Wild symbols on the grid replicate themselves to cover the entire reel.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I play Let It Spin on my smartphone?\n\nYes, this game is suitable for both PC and any mobile device.\n\nIs it possible to buy Free Spins?\n\nYes, you can purchase them at a cost of 70 times the bet.\n\nWhat kind of volatility does Let It Spin have?\n\nThe volatility is medium.",

The game has a Christmassy theme that recreates the atmosphere of Santa Claus with a wooden cabin, decorated tree with colorful lights, piles of gifts and themed background music.\n\nGameplay Details\n\nTo win, players need to create combos of identical symbols on a payline, starting from the left reel and proceeding towards the right. The minimum cost for each spin is €0.30, and the game has medium volatility. Features include automatic spins that will stop when winning and losing limits are reached, and a Turbo button that accelerates the rotation of the reels for faster spins. The RTP is 95%.\n\nSymbols on the Reels\n\nSymbols on the reels in Let it Spin can be split into lower and higher paying values. The lower value symbols are the playing cards inside colorful balls, while higher value symbols include the golden bells, reindeer, teddy bears and Santa Claus. The Wild symbol has a Jolly function and replaces all symbols except the Scatter to create a winning combo. The Scatter is represented by the snowflake and awards up to 20 free spins depending on the number of Scatters landed. Players can also buy free spins at a cost of 70x the bet.\n\nSpecial Features and Bonuses\n\nLet it Spin has two unique random functions triggered by the classic Oh! Oh! Oh! of Santa Claus. The first function named Cold Breeze deposits up to 20 Wilds when a cold breeze enters from the window behind the grid. The second function, Bursting Wild, replicates the Jolly on the grid until they cover the entire reel, increasing the chances of hitting a winning combo.\n\nAvailability on Devices\n\nLet it Spin is available on both PCs and mobile devices, allowing players to enjoy the game on-the-go or from the comfort of their own home.\n\n        \n            ",

If we had to guess, we would say we are inside Santa Claus' house. All the graphics recall Santa Claus, starting from the symbols: the playing cards inside colorful balls, the reindeer, teddy bears, bells, snowflakes and the inevitable Santa Claus.\nTo fuel the holiday spirit, there is also themed background music and the inevitable Oh! Oh! Oh!\n\nFeatures of Let it Spin\nThe game grid consists of 6 reels and 4 rows, 30 fixed pay lines and a maximum win of 2,500 times the bet for a minimum cost of € 0.30 per spin. To win, you need to create combos of identical symbols on a pay line, starting from the left reel and proceeding towards the right.\nAmong the various options, we find the automatic spins that will stop when certain winning and losing limits are reached, and the Turbo, which instead accelerates the rotation of the reels for fast spins.\nThe volatility is medium, while the RTP data stands at a good 95%.\n\nA Burst of Bonus\nThe symbols that land on the reels can be divided into some of low value and others much more remunerative. Belonging to the first group are the playing cards, while the golden bell, reindeer, teddy bear and Santa Claus can be defined as premium symbols.\nAmong the special symbols we find Wild and Scatter. The first has a Jolly function and replaces all symbols except the Scatter in a winning combo. The Scatter is instead represented by the snowflake and depending on the number landed on the reels, rewards us with a number of Free Spins ranging from 8 to 20. We remind you that the Bonus Game can be purchased at a cost of 70x the bet.\nThen there are two special random functions introduced by the classic Oh! Oh! Oh! of Santa Claus. In the first one, a cold breeze that enters from the window behind the grid will deposit up to a maximum of 20 Wilds.\nThe function called Bursting Wild instead ensures that the Jolly on the grid are replicated until they cover the entire reel.\n\nFAQ\nCan I play Let it Spin on my smartphone?\n\nYes, this game is available on both PCs and any mobile device.\n\nIs it possible to buy Free Spins?\n\nYes, they can be purchased at a cost of 70 times the bet.\n\nWhat type of volatility does Let it Spin have?\n\nThe volatility is medium.\n        ",
