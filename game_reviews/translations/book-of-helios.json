The game has a 3x5 format, with 10 paylines and features several symbols related to Helios and the ancient Greek civilization. The game's graphics are well-designed and immerse players in the world of ancient Greek mythology.\n\nBook of the Sun as a Wild and Scatter Symbol\n\nThe Book of the Sun symbol is the most powerful symbol in the Book of Helios slot. It serves as both the wild symbol and the scatter symbol, helping players create winning combinations and obtain prizes. Having three or more Book of Helios symbols on the display in the same spin gives players access to 10 free spins.\n\nFree Spins with Expandable Symbols and Multipliers\n\nDuring the 10 free spins, a symbol is randomly selected to become an expandable symbol. If the expandable symbol appears on the reels, it expands vertically to cover the whole reel and creates more winning combinations. Additionally, if the symbol of the Book of Helios appears during the free spins, it expands and multiplies the winnings by up to 5x.\n\nBuy Feature Option to Access Free Spins Round\n\nOne of the unique features of the Book of Helios slot is the 'Buy Feature' option. This feature allows players to purchase access to the free spins round without having to wait for the symbols to appear naturally. The feature has a set token cost that is indicated on the button that activates it. This feature adds an element of risk and excitement to the game, making it more engaging and interactive.\n\nRTP and Device Compatibility\n\nThe Book of Helios slot has an RTP of 95.58%, which is slightly less than the industry average. However, this is compensated by the high volatility of the game, which means that players can expect larger payouts. The game is compatible with all devices and operating systems, both desktop and mobile. Players can access the game on their desktop computers, smartphones, and tablets, making it convenient for them to play on the go.\n\n        \n            ",
