It has a classic Tutti Frutti theme, with symbols like stars, bells, cherries, lemons, watermelons, grapes, and 7s icons. The game has 5 active paylines that can form winning combinations, with a final prize of up to 5000 times the total bet thanks to the Rise and Mega Rise Chips multipliers.\n\nMultiplier Bar importance\n\nThe Multiplier Bar is a crucial element in the Mega Rise slot game, as the value of your winnings depends on it. The Mega Rise Chip is a symbol that helps increase the multiplier of a random symbol or locks its multiplier on the bar until it contributes to forming a win. The Golden Mega Rise Chip can have a big impact on the multiplier of an icon as well.\n\nProgressive jackpots\n\nThe Mega Rise slot game offers four progressive jackpots, namely the Mega Jackpot, Super Rapid, Must Go, and Daily jackpots. These jackpots can be won randomly during any spin, and they add to the excitement and potential payouts of the game.\n\nSymbols and paylines\n\nThe Mega Rise slot game has symbols like Lucky Seven, Golden Bell, Silver Star, and vintage Fruit that pay the most. There are 5 active paylines in the game, and players have the possibility to set a bet on the entire playing area, with minimum and maximum bets of €0.10 and €40.00 per round respectively. The highest payout in the game is €200,000.\n\nOverall review\n\nMega Rise is a fun and lively fruit-themed slot game that offers high payouts and exciting multipliers. The game has a captivating design and four progressive jackpots that add more excitement and potential payouts. The only downside is that players cannot select a certain number of paylines. Overall, we recommend Mega Rise to fans of Tutti Frutti genre and players looking for big wins in a straightforward and classic slot game.\n\n        \n            ",
