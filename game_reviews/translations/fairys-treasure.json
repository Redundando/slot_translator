Get ready for an experience truly out of this world with glittering Poker symbols and fairies that feature special features.\n\nThe slot machine features a classic 5x3 grid, with symbols floating in the air, offering a glimpse into the mystical scenario behind.

Additionally, the RTP is nothing special, with 95.39%, which is just below the average of other production houses; NetEnt's standards, in particular, are still far from being matched.\n\nFortunately, you can count on a good number of features and bonuses. Secondary symbols, besides those dedicated to Poker, pay out handsomely.

On internet and online gambling sites, you'll find numerous action-packed slots with epic soundtracks and electrifying gameplay experience. But what about girls who want a more feminine and fantastical gaming experience, with a relaxing backdrop that allows them to win big without getting a headache after a few rounds?\n\nIf you're interested in this prospect, read on to learn about the slot game produced by CapeCod.\n\nA Fantasy-Themed Graphics\n\nIn Fairy's Treasure, the slot machine created by Italian production house CapeCod, you find yourself in an enchanted forest. Get ready for an experience truly out of this world with glittering Poker symbols and fairies that feature special features.\n\nThe slot machine features a classic 5x3 grid, with symbols floating in the air, offering a glimpse into the mystical scenario behind. Behind the grid is a distinctly enchanted forest, only partially illuminated by the sun due to the dense foliage of the trees, creating a subtle green misty atmosphere.\n\nThe Poker symbols are beautifully designed, with lots of connections to the game's main theme. Even the Spin-and-betting bar is themed, looking as if made of wood.\n\nIf you're intrigued by this type of slot, read on to learn about the features that allow you to win big.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Game\n\nFirstly, note that Fairy's Treasure, the fantasy-themed slot produced by CapeCod, features a classic 5x3 grid with a total of 25 pay lines. Though the paylines exceed CapeCod's standards, they still barely pass in comparison to other slot machines on the market. Additionally, the RTP is nothing special, with 95.39%, which is just below the average of other production houses; NetEnt's standards, in particular, are still far from being matched.\n\nFortunately, you can count on a good number of features and bonuses. Secondary symbols, besides those dedicated to Poker, pay out handsomely. The ring, for example, which pays the least among them, allows you to earn up to 150 times the wager made, while the casket allows you to earn up to 1,000 times the amount bet.\n\nAdditionally, you can count on the presence of Wild and Scatter symbols. The Wild works as a joker and replaces any symbol in a pay line to form a winning combination.\n\nThe Scatter, on the other hand, lets you get the Free Spins bonus, which grants you access to the Tree Bonus Game mini-game, allowing you to randomly win multipliers or free spins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nFantasy themes aren't just for girls. There are many guys out there who enjoy the genre, which is why we recommend Wild Dragon, the slot machine produced by Amatic that allows you to win up to 500 euros in a single play.\n            ",

Get ready for an experience truly out of this world with glittering Poker symbols and fairies that feature special features.\n\nThe slot machine features a classic 5x3 grid, with symbols floating in the air, offering a glimpse into the mystical scenario behind. Behind the grid is a distinctly enchanted forest, only partially illuminated by the sun due to the dense foliage of the trees, creating a subtle green misty atmosphere.\n\nThe Poker symbols are beautifully designed, with lots of connections to the game's main theme. Even the Spin-and-betting bar is themed, looking as if made of wood.\n\nIf you're intrigued by this type of slot, read on to learn about the features that allow you to win big.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Game\n\nFirstly, note that Fairy's Treasure, the fantasy-themed slot produced by CapeCod, features a classic 5x3 grid with a total of 25 pay lines. Though the paylines exceed CapeCod's standards, they still barely pass in comparison to other slot machines on the market.

Secondary symbols, besides those dedicated to Poker, pay out handsomely.

The Wild works as a joker and replaces any symbol in a pay line to form a winning combination.\n\nThe Scatter, on the other hand, lets you get the Free Spins bonus, which grants you access to the Tree Bonus Game mini-game, allowing you to randomly win multipliers or free spins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nFantasy themes aren't just for girls. There are many guys out there who enjoy the genre, which is why we recommend Wild Dragon, the slot machine produced by Amatic that allows you to win up to 500 euros in a single play.\n            ",

On internet and online gambling sites, you'll find numerous action-packed slots with epic soundtracks and electrifying gameplay experience. But what about girls who want a more feminine and fantastical gaming experience, with a relaxing backdrop that allows them to win big without getting a headache after a few rounds?\n\nIf you're interested in this prospect, read on to learn about the slot game produced by CapeCod.\n\nA Fantasy-Themed Graphics\n\nIn Fairy's Treasure, the slot machine created by Italian production house CapeCod, you find yourself in an enchanted forest. Get ready for an experience truly out of this world with glittering Poker symbols and fairies that feature special features.\n\nThe slot machine features a classic 5x3 grid, with symbols floating in the air, offering a glimpse into the mystical scenario behind. Behind the grid is a distinctly enchanted forest, only partially illuminated by the sun due to the dense foliage of the trees, creating a subtle green misty atmosphere.\n\nThe Poker symbols are beautifully designed, with lots of connections to the game's main theme. Even the Spin-and-betting bar is themed, looking as if made of wood.\n\nIf you're intrigued by this type of slot, read on to learn about the features that allow you to win big.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Game\n\nFirstly, note that Fairy's Treasure, the fantasy-themed slot produced by CapeCod, features a classic 5x3 grid with a total of 25 pay lines. Though the paylines exceed CapeCod's standards, they still barely pass in comparison to other slot machines on the market. Additionally, the RTP is nothing special, with 95.39%, which is just below the average of other production houses; NetEnt's standards, in particular, are still far from being matched.\n\nFortunately, you can count on a good number of features and bonuses. Secondary symbols, besides those dedicated to Poker, pay out handsomely. The ring, for example, which pays the least among them, allows you to earn up to 150 times the wager made, while the casket allows you to earn up to 1,000 times the amount bet.\n\nAdditionally, you can count on the presence of Wild and Scatter symbols. The Wild works as a joker and replaces any symbol in a pay line to form a winning combination.\n\nThe Scatter, on the other hand, lets you get the Free Spins bonus, which grants you access to the Tree Bonus Game mini-game, allowing you to randomly win multipliers or free spins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nFantasy themes aren't just for girls. There are many guys out there who enjoy the genre, which is why we recommend Wild Dragon, the slot machine produced by Amatic that allows you to win up to 500 euros in a single play.\n        ",

The image should capture the enchanted forest setting, with misty green hues and sparkling Poker symbols floating in the air. The warrior should have a playful smile and be surrounded by colourful fairies, highlighting the game's fantasy theme. The Spin-and-betting bar should also be present in the image, made of wood and decorated with elements that match the forest's enchanted theme.
