    "original_text": "\nFortune Falcon wild respins\nPalazzi incantati, cammelli e cavalli bardati con stoffe preziose, un’oasi lussureggiante e naturalmente un falco dalle uova d’oro sono lo scenario in cui ci ritroveremo accedendo a Fortune Falcon Wild Respins. Per creare questa slot la Ainsworth ha messo una particolare attenzione alla grafica, che appare molto dettagliata con qualche animazione a rendere il gioco più piacevole. Lo sfondo è il deserto al tramonto, accanto ai rulli si trova un falco appollaiato su un trespolo e nella parte superiore della griglia di gioco ci sono tre alloggiamenti per accogliere le uova d’oro che appariranno durante gli Spin. Nella parte bassa troviamo invece tutte le impostazioni per settare al meglio la nostra scommessa e altre informazioni utili per capire come si sta evolvendo il gioco.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia ha 5 rulli e 3 righe con 30 linee di pagamento fisse. Si vince allineando almeno 3 simboli uguali da sinistra a destra. Il range va da un minimo di 0,01 € per linea a un massimo di 100 €, ottimo per invogliare sia giocatori meno esperti, sia quelli che amano l’ebrezza del rischio. Per chi volesse, è possibile impostare tra i 10 e 100 giri automatici. La volatilità è media, mentre il ritorno teorico al giocatore (RTP) è di 94,02%, leggermente più basso rispetto ad altre slot, ricordando sempre che tale valore è puramente ipotetico e si basa solo sui grandi numeri.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nCome nella maggior parte delle slot, anche in Fortune Falcon Wild Respins sono presenti i simboli legati alle carte da gioco dal 9 all’asso e naturalmente sono quelli con un più basso valore. A seguire troviamo il forziere da cui traboccano oro e gemme preziose, l’oasi, il cammello, il cavallo e il giaguaro. Tra i simboli speciali troviamo due Wild e uno Scatter. Il primo Wild è il falco e ha una funzione tradizionale, ossia sostituisce tutti i simboli regolari ma non quelli speciali. Il secondo Wild è invece l’uovo dorato di falco, che oltre ad avere funzione di Jolly, ogni volta che appare sul rullo 4, viene spinto in uno dei nidi posti sopra la cornice di gioco. Quando ne collezioneremo 3, allora verremo ricompensato con 3 giri gratuiti durante i quali un grande uovo dorato occuperà ben 3 rulli su 5 comportandosi come un Wild. Ogni volta che avremo una combinazione vincente sulla superficie dell’uovo si formerà una crepa da cui fuoriusciranno monete d’oro.\nAltro simbolo importante è lo Scatter, rappresentato dal palazzo. Oltre ad aver un valore monetario, esso ci ricompensa con 10 giri gratuiti durante i quali potremmo vedere apparire delle monete d’oro con dei moltiplicatori x2 o x5. Se durante i Free Spins atterrerà sui rulli altri 3 o più Scatter, allora ci verranno assegnati 5 ulteriori giri gratuiti.\n",

Ainsworth has put particular attention on the graphics to create this slot, which appears highly detailed with some animations to make the game more enjoyable. The background is the desert at sunset, next to the reels you can find a falcon perched on a perch, and at the top of the game grid there are three slots to accommodate the golden eggs that will appear during the spins. At the bottom we find all the settings to best set our bet and other useful information to understand how the game is evolving.\n\nSlot Features\nThe grid has 5 reels and 3 rows with 30 fixed pay lines. You win by aligning at least 3 identical symbols from left to right. The range goes from a minimum of € 0.01 per line to a maximum of € 100, excellent to entice both less experienced players and those who love the thrill of risk. For those who wish, it is possible to set between 10 and 100 automatic spins. The volatility is medium, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 94.02%, slightly lower than other slots, always remembering that such a value is purely hypothetical and based only on big numbers.\n\nSymbols and Features\nAs in most slots, even in Fortune Falcon Wild Respins there are symbols related to playing cards from 9 to Ace and of course they have lower value. Following them we find the treasure chest overflowing with gold and precious gems, the oasis, the camel, the horse and the jaguar. Among the special symbols we find two Wilds and one Scatter. The first Wild is the falcon and has a traditional function, namely it replaces all regular symbols but not the special ones. The second Wild is instead the golden falcon egg, which in addition to having a Jolly function, every time it appears on reel 4, is pushed into one of the nests placed above the game frame. When we collect 3, we will be rewarded with 3 free spins during which a large golden egg will occupy 3 out of 5 reels behaving like a Wild. Every time we have a winning combination on the surface of the egg, a crack will form from which gold coins will emerge.\n\nAnother important symbol is the Scatter, represented by the palace. In addition to having a monetary value, it rewards us with 10 free spins during which we may see gold coins appear with x2 or x5 multipliers.

Ainsworth has put particular attention on the graphics to create this slot, which appears highly detailed with some animations to make the game more enjoyable. The background is the desert at sunset, next to the reels you can find a falcon perched on a perch, and at the top of the game grid there are three slots to accommodate the golden eggs that will appear during the spins. At the bottom we find all the settings to best set our bet and other useful information to understand how the game is evolving.\n\nSlot Features\nThe grid has 5 reels and 3 rows with 30 fixed pay lines. You win by aligning at least 3 identical symbols from left to right. The range goes from a minimum of € 0.01 per line to a maximum of € 100, excellent to entice both less experienced players and those who love the thrill of risk. For those who wish, it is possible to set between 10 and 100 automatic spins. The volatility is medium, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 94.02%, slightly lower than other slots, always remembering that such a value is purely hypothetical and based only on big numbers.\n\nSymbols and Features\nAs in most slots, even in Fortune Falcon Wild Respins there are symbols related to playing cards from 9 to Ace and of course they have lower value. Following them we find the treasure chest overflowing with gold and precious gems, the oasis, the camel, the horse and the jaguar. Among the special symbols we find two Wilds and one Scatter. The first Wild is the falcon and has a traditional function, namely it replaces all regular symbols but not the special ones. The second Wild is instead the golden falcon egg, which in addition to having a Jolly function, every time it appears on reel 4, is pushed into one of the nests placed above the game frame. When we collect 3, we will be rewarded with 3 free spins during which a large golden egg will occupy 3 out of 5 reels behaving like a Wild. Every time we have a winning combination on the surface of the egg, a crack will form from which gold coins will emerge.\n\nAnother important symbol is the Scatter, represented by the palace. In addition to having a monetary value, it rewards us with 10 free spins during which we may see gold coins appear with x2 or x5 multipliers. If during the Free Spins, another 3 or more Scatters will land on the reels, we will be awarded 5 additional free spins.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\nFortune Falcon Wild Respins has a 5-reel, 3-row grid with 30 fixed pay lines. Winning combinations are formed by aligning at least 3 identical symbols in sequence from left to right. Players can bet a range of €0.01 to €100, which makes it attractive for both novice and experienced players. The game is of medium volatility, and its theoretical RTP is 94.02%, which is slightly lower than other slots.\n\nSymbols\n\nFortune Falcon Wild Respins has both regular symbols and special symbols. The regular symbols include playing cards from 9 to Ace, treasure chest overflowing with gold and precious gems, the oasis, the camel, the horse, and the jaguar. The two Wilds are the falcon and the golden falcon egg. The falcon replaces all regular symbols except special ones, while the golden falcon egg has a Jolly function and is pushed into one of the nests placed above the game frame when it appears on reel 4. The Scatter is represented by the palace and has a monetary value. It rewards  players with 10 free spins, during which they may see gold coins with x2 or x5 multipliers emerge. The golden egg and palace symbols trigger exciting bonus features in the game.\n\nBonuses\n\nThe game has two special symbols - the golden egg falcon and the palace - that initiate the bonus features. The golden egg fills one of the three slots at the top of the screen when it appears on reel 4, and when all the three slots are filled, the free spins bonus feature is triggered. During this feature, a large golden egg will occupy 3 out of 5 reels and will behave as a Wild. Every time a winning combination is formed on the surface of the egg, a crack will create an opening from which gold coins emerge. The palace symbol triggers the free spins feature, and players can win 10 free spins if they land three scatter symbols on the reels. During the free spins, gold coins may emerge with x2 or x5 multipliers, and if players land three or more Scatters on the reels, they will receive an additional 5 free spins.\n\nBetting\n\nA range of €0.01 to €100 is set for players to place their bets. Players can set between 10 and 100 automatic spins, and the game has medium volatility. The RTP is 94.02%, which is slightly lower than other slot games. It is worth noting that the RTP is purely hypothetical and based only on large numbers.\n\nVisuals\n\nFortune Falcon Wild Respins is set against the backdrop of a desert at sunset with camels, horses, palaces, and massive golden egg falcons within. The graphics of this slot game are detailed, and there are some animations that enhance the overall experience of playing this game. The falcon perched on a perch next to the reels creates an enchanting storyline that immerses players in the game. The bottom of the game frame contains all the settings for the players to make the most of the game. It is a visually stunning and high-quality slot game that players will love to play.\n\n        \n            ",

Ainsworth has put particular attention on the graphics to create this slot, which appears highly detailed with some animations to make the game more enjoyable. The background is the desert at sunset, next to the reels you can find a falcon perched on a perch, and at the top of the game grid there are three slots to accommodate the golden eggs that will appear during the spins. At the bottom we find all the settings to best set our bet and other useful information to understand how the game is evolving.\n\nSlot Features\nThe grid has 5 reels and 3 rows with 30 fixed pay lines. You win by aligning at least 3 identical symbols from left to right. The range goes from a minimum of € 0.01 per line to a maximum of € 100, excellent to entice both less experienced players and those who love the thrill of risk. For those who wish, it is possible to set between 10 and 100 automatic spins. The volatility is medium, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 94.02%, slightly lower than other slots, always remembering that such a value is purely hypothetical and based only on big numbers.\n\nSymbols and Features\nAs in most slots, even in Fortune Falcon Wild Respins there are symbols related to playing cards from 9 to Ace and of course they have lower value. Following them we find the treasure chest overflowing with gold and precious gems, the oasis, the camel, the horse and the jaguar. Among the special symbols we find two Wilds and one Scatter. The first Wild is the falcon and has a traditional function, namely it replaces all regular symbols but not the special ones. The second Wild is instead the golden falcon egg, which in addition to having a Jolly function, every time it appears on reel 4, is pushed into one of the nests placed above the game frame. When we collect 3, we will be rewarded with 3 free spins during which a large golden egg will occupy 3 out of 5 reels behaving like a Wild. Every time we have a winning combination on the surface of the egg, a crack will form from which gold coins will emerge.\n\nAnother important symbol is the Scatter, represented by the palace. In addition to having a monetary value, it rewards us with 10 free spins during which we may see gold coins appear with x2 or x5 multipliers. If during the Free Spins, another 3 or more Scatters will land on the reels, we will be awarded 5 additional free spins.\n            ",

Ainsworth has put particular attention on the graphics to create this slot, which appears highly detailed with some animations to make the game more enjoyable. The background is the desert at sunset, next to the reels you can find a falcon perched on a perch, and at the top of the game grid there are three slots to accommodate the golden eggs that will appear during the spins. At the bottom we find all the settings to best set our bet and other useful information to understand how the game is evolving.\n\nSlot Features\nThe grid has 5 reels and 3 rows with 30 fixed pay lines. You win by aligning at least 3 identical symbols from left to right. The range goes from a minimum of € 0.01 per line to a maximum of € 100, excellent to entice both less experienced players and those who love the thrill of risk. For those who wish, it is possible to set between 10 and 100 automatic spins. The volatility is medium, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 94.02%, slightly lower than other slots, always remembering that such a value is purely hypothetical and based only on big numbers.\n\nSymbols and Features\nAs in most slots, even in Fortune Falcon Wild Respins there are symbols related to playing cards from 9 to Ace and of course they have lower value. Following them we find the treasure chest overflowing with gold and precious gems, the oasis, the camel, the horse and the jaguar. Among the special symbols we find two Wilds and one Scatter. The first Wild is the falcon and has a traditional function, namely it replaces all regular symbols but not the special ones. The second Wild is instead the golden falcon egg, which in addition to having a Jolly function, every time it appears on reel 4, is pushed into one of the nests placed above the game frame. When we collect 3, we will be rewarded with 3 free spins during which a large golden egg will occupy 3 out of 5 reels behaving like a Wild. Every time we have a winning combination on the surface of the egg, a crack will form from which gold coins will emerge.\n\nAnother important symbol is the Scatter, represented by the palace. In addition to having a monetary value, it rewards us with 10 free spins during which we may see gold coins appear with x2 or x5 multipliers. If during the Free Spins, another 3 or more Scatters will land on the reels, we will be awarded 5 additional free spins.\n            ",
