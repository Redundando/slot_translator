    "original_text": "\nGenie Jackpots Megaways\nChe differenza c’è tra questa slot e la versione basica di Genie Jackpots? Semplice, il fatto di essere Megaways, e di poter quindi contare su una serie di caratteristiche innovative di cui parleremo tra poco. Genie Jackpots Megaways riesce quindi a essere un prodotto abbastanza classico, per modalità di gioco e stile, ma è anche un prodotto di ultima generazione, con una tecnologia che rende ancora più avanzata l’esperienza di gaming. Ma per capire meglio il concetto che si nasconde dietro a questa slot voglia parlare di funzionalità e delle caratteristiche di questa macchinetta online.\nGrafica della slot\nDiciamo che di base le Megaways sono slot che si affidano a un meccanismo alternativo che aumenta di oltre 150.000 le possibilità di ottenere combinazioni vincenti per ogni giro. La Genie Jackpots Megaways quindi non cambia molto dalla sua versione originale di Genie Jackpots, firmata sempre dall’house di Blueprint Gaming. La differenza sostanziale è data dalla grafica in 2D, alla quale è poi affiancata in questo caso anche il 3D per implementare piccole parti del gioco. I personaggi del gioco, in particolare il genio, acquistano quindi un fascino diverso con questi miglioramenti grafici. A livello estetico però resta molto simile alla sua versione precedente. In questa modalità di gioco innovativa, ogni giocatore avrà più di 15mila modi per vincere ad ogni giro sui 6 rulli del gioco. Ogni rullo può mostrare da 2 a 7 simboli; è presto detto che più simboli si ottengono e maggiore è la possibilità di vincere.\nLe funzioni e i bonus\nBlueprint Gaming ci ha offerto quindi un remake, o meglio un aggiornamento della sua slot base, pensando a questo nuovo gioco che è molto più ricco di possibilità. Presenta 9 bonus che puoi attivare in gioco, e offre giri gratuiti con tantissime vittorie garantite. Il suo RTP arriva a 96.52%, quindi in media con i titoli più importanti del settore. Tra le funzioni che ti aiutano a vincere premi extra da aggiungere al tuo budget citiamo il Wild Megaways, che porta i jolly a essere aggiunti sui rulli. Oppure il Genie Win Spin, con simboli misteriosi e jolly che si uniscono per aumentare le possibilità di vincita.\nI giri gratuiti sono attivabili mentre ci troviamo già in modalità free spin, incontrando, per esempio, i simboli misteriosi. Con i Locking Wild ogni simbolo Wild che si posiziona su tre rulli centrali, si espande e blocca la propria posizione. E infine con il Genie Streak se ottieni una vittoria bonus, i rulli continuano ad assegnarti una vittoria che è sempre più grande.\nConsiderazioni finali\nSiamo arrivati alla fine di questa recensione e con piacere possiamo promuovere la slot con buoni voti. Sì, è un grande classico, ma è emozionante ed è stato implementato dal team di Blueprint Gaming. Il divertimento è aumentato, grazie anche ai nuovi bonus che troviamo al suo interno. Manca un jackpot progressivo, ma non è un dettaglio che si senta particolarmente, anzi si può comodamente ovviare a questa cosa. Questo perché il gioco non solo scorre bene e in modo fluido, ma anche perché è frequente riuscire a sommare premi e vincite generose.\n",

Simply put, it's the Megaways feature which introduces a series of innovative functions we'll discuss shortly. Genie Jackpots Megaways manages to be a fairly classic product in terms of gameplay and style, while also being cutting-edge with technology that heightens the gaming experience. To better understand the concept behind this slot, let's talk about its features.\nSlot graphics\nMegaways slots rely on an alternative mechanism that increases winning combinations by over 150,000 per spin. Genie Jackpots Megaways doesn't change much from the original version developed by Blueprint Gaming. The main difference lies in the 2D graphics, which are complemented by 3D in certain areas of the game. The characters, particularly the genie, are given a certain charm thanks to these improved graphics. Aesthetically, however, it remains quite similar to the previous version. In this innovative gameplay mode, each player has over 15,000 ways to win on the 6 reels of the game. Each reel can display 2 to 7 symbols, and as such, the more symbols, the greater the chance of winning.\nFunctions and bonuses\nBlueprint Gaming offers a remake, or rather an upgrade, of its base slot to create this far richer game. It features 9 bonuses that can be triggered during play and offers free spins with many guaranteed wins. Its RTP is 96.52%, making it on par with the most important titles in the industry. Among the functions that help you win extra prizes to add to your budget, we highlight the Wild Megaways, adding wilds to the reels, and the Genie Win Spin, which combines mystery symbols and wilds to increase your chances of winning.\nFree spins can be activated while in free-spin mode, for instance, when encountering mystery symbols. With Locking Wilds, every wild symbol that appears on the three middle reels expands and locks its position. Finally, with the Genie Streak, if you achieve a bonus win, the reels keep awarding you an increasingly bigger win.\nFinal thoughts\nWe've reached the end of this review and can happily give this slot great marks. Yes, it's a classic, but it's exciting and has been enhanced by Blueprint Gaming. Thanks to the new bonuses, the fun factor has increased. There's no progressive jackpot, but it's not a detail that's particularly missed since it's easy to work around.

Simply put, it's a Megaways slot, which means it boasts a range of innovative features that we'll discuss shortly. Genie Jackpots Megaways manages to be a fairly classic product in terms of game modes and style, but it's also a state-of-the-art offering that delivers a more advanced gaming experience. But to better understand the concept behind this slot, let's talk about its features and functionalities.\n\nThe Slot's Graphics\nThe Megaways slots rely on an alternative mechanism that increases the chances of obtaining over 150,000 winning combinations per spin. Genie Jackpots Megaways, therefore, doesn't differ much from its original version - the Genie Jackpots, that was also produced by the house of Blueprint Gaming - except for the fact that it features 2D graphics, which are then complemented with 3D to enhance certain parts of the game. The game characters, especially the genie, acquire a different charm with these graphical enhancements. However, aesthetically speaking, it remains quite similar to its previous version. In this innovative game mode, each player gets more than 15,000 ways to win on the 6 reels of the game, with each reel displaying between 2 to 7 symbols; it goes without saying that the more symbols one obtains, the higher their chances of winning.\n\nThe Functions and Bonuses\nBlueprint Gaming provides us with a remake or rather an upgrade of its base slot, offering this new game that is full of possibilities. It features 9 bonuses that you can activate during the game and offers free spins with guaranteed victories. Its RTP reaches up to 96.52%, which is equivalent to the industry's top titles. Among the functions that help you win extra prizes to add to your budget, we have the Wild Megaways, which adds wild cards to the reels. Or the Genie Win Spin, which offers mysterious symbols and wild cards that combine to increase your chances of winning.\n\nFree spins can be activated while already in free spin mode when, for example, you encounter the mysterious symbols. With the Locking Wild, every Wild symbol that lands on the three central reels expands and locks in its position. And finally, with the Genie Streak, if you obtain a bonus victory, the reels keep giving you increasingly larger wins.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWe've reached the end of this review, and we're pleased to say that we give this slot good marks. Yes, it's a classic, but it's also exciting, and it has been enhanced by Blueprint Gaming's team. The fun factor has increased - thanks in part to the new bonuses it features. There isn't a progressive jackpot, but it's not a feature that is missed particularly; on the contrary, it's easy to do without it. This is because the game not only runs smoothly but also allows players to score generous prizes and big wins.\n            ",

Simply put, it's a Megaways slot, which means it boasts a range of innovative features that we'll discuss shortly. Genie Jackpots Megaways manages to be a fairly classic product in terms of game modes and style, but it's also a state-of-the-art offering that delivers a more advanced gaming experience. But to better understand the concept behind this slot, let's talk about its features and functionalities.\n\nThe Slot's Graphics\nThe Megaways slots rely on an alternative mechanism that increases the chances of obtaining over 150,000 winning combinations per spin. Genie Jackpots Megaways, therefore, doesn't differ much from its original version - the Genie Jackpots, that was also produced by the house of Blueprint Gaming - except for the fact that it features 2D graphics, which are then complemented with 3D to enhance certain parts of the game. The game characters, especially the genie, acquire a different charm with these graphical enhancements. However, aesthetically speaking, it remains quite similar to its previous version. In this innovative game mode, each player gets more than 15,000 ways to win on the 6 reels of the game, with each reel displaying between 2 to 7 symbols; it goes without saying that the more symbols one obtains, the higher their chances of winning.\n\nThe Functions and Bonuses\nBlueprint Gaming provides us with a remake or rather an upgrade of its base slot, offering this new game that is full of possibilities. It features 9 bonuses that you can activate during the game and offers free spins with guaranteed victories. Its RTP reaches up to 96.52%, which is equivalent to the industry's top titles. Among the functions that help you win extra prizes to add to your budget, we have the Wild Megaways, which adds wild cards to the reels. Or the Genie Win Spin, which offers mysterious symbols and wild cards that combine to increase your chances of winning.\n\nFree spins can be activated while already in free spin mode when, for example, you encounter the mysterious symbols. With the Locking Wild, every Wild symbol that lands on the three central reels expands and locks in its position. And finally, with the Genie Streak, if you obtain a bonus victory, the reels keep giving you increasingly larger wins.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWe've reached the end of this review, and we're pleased to say that we give this slot good marks. Yes, it's a classic, but it's also exciting, and it has been enhanced by Blueprint Gaming's team. The fun factor has increased - thanks in part to the new bonuses it features. There isn't a progressive jackpot, but it's not a feature that is missed particularly; on the contrary, it's easy to do without it. This is because the game not only runs smoothly but also allows players to score generous prizes and big wins.\n            ",

Simply put, it's a Megaways slot, which means it boasts a range of innovative features that we'll discuss shortly. Genie Jackpots Megaways manages to be a fairly classic product in terms of game modes and style, but it's also a state-of-the-art offering that delivers a more advanced gaming experience. But to better understand the concept behind this slot, let's talk about its features and functionalities.\n\nThe Slot's Graphics\nThe Megaways slots rely on an alternative mechanism that increases the chances of obtaining over 150,000 winning combinations per spin. Genie Jackpots Megaways, therefore, doesn't differ much from its original version - the Genie Jackpots, that was also produced by the house of Blueprint Gaming - except for the fact that it features 2D graphics, which are then complemented with 3D to enhance certain parts of the game. The game characters, especially the genie, acquire a different charm with these graphical enhancements. However, aesthetically speaking, it remains quite similar to its previous version. In this innovative game mode, each player gets more than 15,000 ways to win on the 6 reels of the game, with each reel displaying between 2 to 7 symbols; it goes without saying that the more symbols one obtains, the higher their chances of winning.\n\nThe Functions and Bonuses\nBlueprint Gaming provides us with a remake or rather an upgrade of its base slot, offering this new game that is full of possibilities. It features 9 bonuses that you can activate during the game and offers free spins with guaranteed victories. Its RTP reaches up to 96.52%, which is equivalent to the industry's top titles. Among the functions that help you win extra prizes to add to your budget, we have the Wild Megaways, which adds wild cards to the reels. Or the Genie Win Spin, which offers mysterious symbols and wild cards that combine to increase your chances of winning.\n\nFree spins can be activated while already in free spin mode when, for example, you encounter the mysterious symbols. With the Locking Wild, every Wild symbol that lands on the three central reels expands and locks in its position. And finally, with the Genie Streak, if you obtain a bonus victory, the reels keep giving you increasingly larger wins.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWe've reached the end of this review, and we're pleased to say that we give this slot good marks. Yes, it's a classic, but it's also exciting, and it has been enhanced by Blueprint Gaming's team. The fun factor has increased - thanks in part to the new bonuses it features. There isn't a progressive jackpot, but it's not a feature that is missed particularly; on the contrary, it's easy to do without it. This is because the game not only runs smoothly but also allows players to score generous prizes and big wins.\n        ",
