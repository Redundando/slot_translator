The game works on both desktop and mobile devices, with bets starting from 2.50 up to 25 coins per spin. Maximum wins can reach 2,500 times the bet amount.\n\nTheme\n\nElvis Frog in Vegas features a unique theme of a crooning amphibian donning the signature quiff and flashy attire in the City of Lights amidst an array of neon and bold hues for a dazzling visual impact and loads of entertainment. The design is visually impressive yet not overly gimmicky.\n\nSpecial Symbols and Features\n\nThematic symbols in Elvis Frog in Vegas are closely linked to music and Las Vegas, including an 'old-style' microphone, a pink luxury car, and Elvis Frog himself. There are also three special symbols, with Elvis Frog as the game's wild symbol, the star as the scatter symbol, and the gold coin allowing players to compete for one of three fixed jackpots. Landing three stars on reels 1, 3, and 5 triggers the Free Spins mode.\n\nJackpot System\n\nElvis Frog in Vegas offers players the chance to compete for one of three fixed jackpots, which can be won by landing gold coin symbols on the reels during either the base game or the free spins mode. The three jackpots consist of the Mini, Minor, and Major, with the latter offering the highest payout. The jackpot system adds an extra exciting element to the game and provides the potential for significant payouts.\n\nWinning Potential and RTP\n\nElvis Frog in Vegas has medium volatility, which means players can expect to win relatively frequently but will have to work harder to snag larger payouts. The return to player (RTP) rate is average at 94%. The game offers a maximum win of 2,500 times the bet amount, which provides players with significant winning potential. Overall, Elvis Frog in Vegas offers a balanced and enjoyable slot game experience.\n\n        \n            ",

But BGaming has offered a refreshingly unique take with Elvis Frog in Vegas, featuring a crooning amphibian donning the signature quiff and flashy attire in the City of Lights amidst an array of neon and bold hues for a dazzling visual impact and loads of entertainment.\n\nThe intro screen greets the player with a close-up of frog-Elvis against a Las Vegas backdrop, with the same background carried over onto the game screen with the reels boldly yet simplistically designed. BGaming has built a reputation for creating visually impressive games, though not overly gimmicky. If you're seeking slots with enormous special effects or 3D animations, look elsewhere, but rest assured Elvis Frog in Vegas still has plenty of delightful surprises in store!\n\nKey features of Elvis Frog in Vegas\nElvis Frog in Vegas works on both desktop and mobile devices, including tablets and smartphones, and is compatible with iOS, Windows, and Android, while bets start from 2.50 up to 25 coins per spin.\n\nStructurally, Elvis Frog in Vegas is quite standard, offering five reels, three rows, and 25 paylines, while maximum wins can reach 2,500 times the bet amount.\n\nElvis Frog in Vegas has medium volatility, which means players can expect to win relatively frequently but will have to work harder to snag larger payouts. The return to player (RTP) rate is average at 94%.\n\nSymbols and special features in Elvis Frog in Vegas\nAs with most slots, symbols in Elvis Frog in Vegas can be split into thematic and generic categories, with the latter comprising the numbers and alphabets representing poker cards. Thematic symbols are closely linked to music and Las Vegas, including a star, an \"old-style\" microphone, a pink luxury car, a charming frog dancer, and, of course, Elvis Frog himself!\n\nThere are three special symbols in Elvis Frog in Vegas: Elvis Frog is the game's wild symbol, offering the most substantial payouts while also acting as a wild card. The star, on the other hand, is the scatter symbol; landing on reels 1, 3, and 5 triggers the Free Spins mode. The gold coin appears during both base and free spins, allowing players to compete for one of three fixed jackpots!\n        ",
