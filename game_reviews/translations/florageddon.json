The game also features an Autoplay feature, allowing players to spin the reels automatically. Pressing the lightning bolt symbol speeds up the rotation of the reels.\n\nVisuals\n\nYggdrasil has created a visually stunning game with \"Florageddon!\". The game's impeccable graphics and perfect blend of horror and comedy will transport players to an apocalyptic setting where killer plants, malevolent mushrooms, and invasive roots are waiting to destroy any form of life.\n\nPayouts\n\nThe game features a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €100, with an RTP of 96%. The symbols in the game include four low-value playing cards and higher-paying symbols such as a street sign, a clock, a lamppost, and a fire hydrant. The highest payout comes from the four demonic plants, while the roots are the Wild symbol, replacing all regular symbols. The game's high volatility means that players will have a tougher time winning, but experienced gamblers will find the rewards equally thrilling.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nOne unique feature of \"Florageddon!\" is the two sets of multipliers: the multiplier on the right applies to winning combinations that begin from the fifth reel and move towards the first, while the left multipliers apply to combinations that begin from the first reel and move towards the last. Every win increases the multiplier, but after a non-winning spin, the multiplier resets to its initial value. Additionally, each win adds to a special counter placed above the grid. Once the four notches are complete, players will receive a special prize, such as a +10 to the multiplier, two Wilds instead of one, or a column of Wilds. The game's Scatter symbol is the skull, which rewards players with 7, 9, or 11 free spins. Before the free spins start, players can even place a bet to win additional free spins. Players can also purchase free spins or activate the Golden Bet, which offers a special prize after three non-winning spins instead of four.\n\nVolatility\n\nWith its high volatility, players of \"Florageddon!\" will have a tougher time winning, but experienced gamblers will find the rewards equally thrilling.\n\n        \n            ",

As soon as you start the game, you'll be transported to an apocalyptic setting, where killer plants, malevolent mushrooms, and invasive roots are waiting to destroy any form of life. With impeccable graphics and a perfect blend of horror and comedy, Yggdrasil has truly outdone itself in creating a visually stunning game. The game features a classic 5x3 grid with a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €100. \n\nOne unique feature of \"Florageddon!\" is that you can win by matching identical symbols starting from the first reel on either side and going towards the other. The game also comes with an Autoplay feature, allowing players to spin the reels automatically. Pressing the lightning bolt symbol speeds up the rotation of the reels. The game's RTP is also good, at a respectable 96%.\n\n\"Florageddon!\" has two sets of multipliers: the multiplier on the right applies to winning combinations that begin from the fifth reel and move towards the first, while the left multipliers apply to combinations that begin from the first reel and move towards the last. Every win increases the multiplier, but after a non-winning spin, the multiplier resets to its initial value. With each winning combination, paying symbols are removed and replaced by other symbols, including a Wild. Additionally, each win adds to a special counter placed above the grid. Once the four notches are complete, you'll receive a special prize, such as a +10 to the multiplier, two Wilds instead of one, or a column of Wilds. Another special prize is the removal of non-winning symbols and the falling of new ones.\n\nThe game's symbols include four low-value playing cards. Higher-paying symbols include a street sign, a clock, a lamppost, and a fire hydrant. The highest payout is from the four demonic plants, while the roots are the Wild symbol, replacing all regular symbols. The skull is the Scatter symbol and rewards players with 7, 9, or 11 free spins. Before the start of the free spins, players can even place a bet to win additional free spins. Players can also purchase free spins or activate the Golden Bet, which offers a special prize after three non-winning spins instead of four. \n\nFor those wondering about its compatibility, \"Florageddon!\" is available on all devices, including smartphones, PCs, and tablets. Its high volatility means that players will have a tougher time winning, but the rewards will be equally thrilling for experienced gamblers.\n            ",
