La sua struttura è una classica 5 rulli con 5 linee di pagamento e 3 file: essendo molto basica non prevede funzionalità bonus, ma nonostante ciò il gioco ha molto da offrire, grazie anche ai suoi jolly in espansione.

La grafica è pulita e semplice, così come le sue regole: bisogna allineare da 2 a 5 simboli su una qualsiasi delle 5 linee di pagamento, partendo dal primo rullo. I pagamenti migliori in questa slot sono attribuiti ai numeri 7 e alla campana. Il 7 paga il doppio della tua puntata e farà vincere fino a 500 volte la puntata se ne trovi cinque. Nel caso della campana invece offre vincite che vanno da 8 a 150 volte la tua puntata se ne trovi 3, 4 o 5 icone.

Ma non è finita qui: con l’Extra Scatter, sui rulli 1, 3 e 5, avrai una ricompensa di 30 volte per 3 dei simboli uguali.

Synot Games has become known for their retro-style solutions, which is exactly what Fruits n Fire offers. It appears to have been adapted from a land-based slot machine and then launched online. We have the classic fruit-themed machine, filling the reels with numbers 7, bells, cherries, watermelons, and much more. In this case, we have a game version with a touch of exoticism, but never too elaborated. Its structure is a classic 5-reel with 5 pay lines and 3 rows: being very basic, it does not provide bonus features, but despite this, the game has much to offer, thanks to its expanding wilds. We also find 2 types of scatter symbols and a gambling feature. Let's take a closer look at what it offers and how it can be a suitable solution for you.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nFruits n Fire is an intuitive title: all you have to do is set your bet and spin the reels. The graphics are clean and simple, as are the rules: align 2 to 5 symbols on any of the 5 pay lines, starting from the first reel. The best payouts in this slot are attributed to numbers 7 and the bell. The 7 pays double your bet and can win up to 500 times your bet if you find five of them. In the case of the bell, it offers winnings ranging from 8 to 150 times your bet if you find 3, 4, or 5 icons. Similarly interesting are the symbols of watermelon, grapes, plum, orange, lemon, and cherry, whose value is expressed in the order we have indicated, ranging from 2x to 100x.\n\nThe three special symbols are the scatter, which as mentioned does not serve to activate a bonus round but only for payments. It offers a prize equal to 3 times your bet if you position 3; with 5 of this type, you will arrive at 100 times your bet. But it doesn't end there: with the Extra Scatter, on reels 1, 3, and 5, you will receive a reward of 30 times for 3 of the same symbols. And finally, we end with the Wilds: they can appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 during gameplay and replace all symbols except the two mentioned above. It can expand and fill a reel.\n\nSpecial functions\n\nThe only function presented is that of your \"gamble\" bet: it is a special game that allows you to double the prize by making a 50/50 choice on the color of the card to be drawn. When you guess correctly, you win double, but if you're wrong, you lose what you've accumulated. You can choose to split the money to save yourself and not compromise your winnings.\n\nFinal considerations on the slot Fruits n Fire\n\nFruits n Fire is synonymous with simplicity that shows with its layout, as well as its game and betting choices.

Synot Games has become known for their retro-style solutions, which is exactly what Fruits n Fire offers. It appears to have been adapted from a land-based slot machine and then launched online. We have the classic fruit-themed machine, filling the reels with numbers 7, bells, cherries, watermelons, and much more. In this case, we have a game version with a touch of exoticism, but never too elaborated. Its structure is a classic 5-reel with 5 pay lines and 3 rows: being very basic, it does not provide bonus features, but despite this, the game has much to offer, thanks to its expanding wilds. We also find 2 types of scatter symbols and a gambling feature. Let's take a closer look at what it offers and how it can be a suitable solution for you.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nFruits n Fire is an intuitive title: all you have to do is set your bet and spin the reels. The graphics are clean and simple, as are the rules: align 2 to 5 symbols on any of the 5 pay lines, starting from the first reel. The best payouts in this slot are attributed to numbers 7 and the bell. The 7 pays double your bet and can win up to 500 times your bet if you find five of them. In the case of the bell, it offers winnings ranging from 8 to 150 times your bet if you find 3, 4, or 5 icons. Similarly interesting are the symbols of watermelon, grapes, plum, orange, lemon, and cherry, whose value is expressed in the order we have indicated, ranging from 2x to 100x.\n\nThe three special symbols are the scatter, which as mentioned does not serve to activate a bonus round but only for payments. It offers a prize equal to 3 times your bet if you position 3; with 5 of this type, you will arrive at 100 times your bet. But it doesn't end there: with the Extra Scatter, on reels 1, 3, and 5, you will receive a reward of 30 times for 3 of the same symbols. And finally, we end with the Wilds: they can appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 during gameplay and replace all symbols except the two mentioned above. It can expand and fill a reel.\n\nSpecial functions\n\nThe only function presented is that of your \"gamble\" bet: it is a special game that allows you to double the prize by making a 50/50 choice on the color of the card to be drawn. When you guess correctly, you win double, but if you're wrong, you lose what you've accumulated. You can choose to split the money to save yourself and not compromise your winnings.\n\nFinal considerations on the slot Fruits n Fire\n\nFruits n Fire is synonymous with simplicity that shows with its layout, as well as its game and betting choices. It is a solid idea that adapts well to any type of player. Its maximum jackpot is 2,500 times your bet, and its RTP is fixed at a percentage of 96.19%, in line with the average of machines.

Synot Games has become known for their retro-style solutions, which is exactly what Fruits n Fire offers. It appears to have been adapted from a land-based slot machine and then launched online. We have the classic fruit-themed machine, filling the reels with numbers 7, bells, cherries, watermelons, and much more. In this case, we have a game version with a touch of exoticism, but never too elaborated. Its structure is a classic 5-reel with 5 pay lines and 3 rows: being very basic, it does not provide bonus features, but despite this, the game has much to offer, thanks to its expanding wilds. We also find 2 types of scatter symbols and a gambling feature. Let's take a closer look at what it offers and how it can be a suitable solution for you.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nFruits n Fire is an intuitive title: all you have to do is set your bet and spin the reels. The graphics are clean and simple, as are the rules: align 2 to 5 symbols on any of the 5 pay lines, starting from the first reel. The best payouts in this slot are attributed to numbers 7 and the bell. The 7 pays double your bet and can win up to 500 times your bet if you find five of them. In the case of the bell, it offers winnings ranging from 8 to 150 times your bet if you find 3, 4, or 5 icons. Similarly interesting are the symbols of watermelon, grapes, plum, orange, lemon, and cherry, whose value is expressed in the order we have indicated, ranging from 2x to 100x.\n\nThe three special symbols are the scatter, which as mentioned does not serve to activate a bonus round but only for payments. It offers a prize equal to 3 times your bet if you position 3; with 5 of this type, you will arrive at 100 times your bet. But it doesn't end there: with the Extra Scatter, on reels 1, 3, and 5, you will receive a reward of 30 times for 3 of the same symbols. And finally, we end with the Wilds: they can appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 during gameplay and replace all symbols except the two mentioned above. It can expand and fill a reel.\n\nSpecial functions\n\nThe only function presented is that of your \"gamble\" bet: it is a special game that allows you to double the prize by making a 50/50 choice on the color of the card to be drawn. When you guess correctly, you win double, but if you're wrong, you lose what you've accumulated. You can choose to split the money to save yourself and not compromise your winnings.\n\nFinal considerations on the slot Fruits n Fire\n\nFruits n Fire is synonymous with simplicity that shows with its layout, as well as its game and betting choices. It is a solid idea that adapts well to any type of player. Its maximum jackpot is 2,500 times your bet, and its RTP is fixed at a percentage of 96.19%, in line with the average of machines. As an experienced gambler, you will find that Fruits n Fire provides an enjoyable and straightforward gaming experience.\n            ",

Synot Games has become known for their retro-style solutions, which is exactly what Fruits n Fire offers. It appears to have been adapted from a land-based slot machine and then launched online. We have the classic fruit-themed machine, filling the reels with numbers 7, bells, cherries, watermelons, and much more. In this case, we have a game version with a touch of exoticism, but never too elaborated. Its structure is a classic 5-reel with 5 pay lines and 3 rows: being very basic, it does not provide bonus features, but despite this, the game has much to offer, thanks to its expanding wilds. We also find 2 types of scatter symbols and a gambling feature. Let's take a closer look at what it offers and how it can be a suitable solution for you.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nFruits n Fire is an intuitive title: all you have to do is set your bet and spin the reels. The graphics are clean and simple, as are the rules: align 2 to 5 symbols on any of the 5 pay lines, starting from the first reel. The best payouts in this slot are attributed to numbers 7 and the bell. The 7 pays double your bet and can win up to 500 times your bet if you find five of them. In the case of the bell, it offers winnings ranging from 8 to 150 times your bet if you find 3, 4, or 5 icons. Similarly interesting are the symbols of watermelon, grapes, plum, orange, lemon, and cherry, whose value is expressed in the order we have indicated, ranging from 2x to 100x.\n\nThe three special symbols are the scatter, which as mentioned does not serve to activate a bonus round but only for payments. It offers a prize equal to 3 times your bet if you position 3; with 5 of this type, you will arrive at 100 times your bet. But it doesn't end there: with the Extra Scatter, on reels 1, 3, and 5, you will receive a reward of 30 times for 3 of the same symbols. And finally, we end with the Wilds: they can appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 during gameplay and replace all symbols except the two mentioned above. It can expand and fill a reel.\n\nSpecial functions\n\nThe only function presented is that of your \"gamble\" bet: it is a special game that allows you to double the prize by making a 50/50 choice on the color of the card to be drawn. When you guess correctly, you win double, but if you're wrong, you lose what you've accumulated. You can choose to split the money to save yourself and not compromise your winnings.\n\nFinal considerations on the slot Fruits n Fire\n\nFruits n Fire is synonymous with simplicity that shows with its layout, as well as its game and betting choices. It is a solid idea that adapts well to any type of player. Its maximum jackpot is 2,500 times your bet, and its RTP is fixed at a percentage of 96.19%, in line with the average of machines. As an experienced gambler, you will find that Fruits n Fire provides an enjoyable and straightforward gaming experience.\n            ",
