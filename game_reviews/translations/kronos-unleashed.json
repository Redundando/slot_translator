Keep reading to gain insight into everything you need to know about this Slot!\n\nMythical Graphics\nAlthough we stated that the gods are the protagonists of the Slot Machine, that is not necessarily true.

Should he appear three times simultaneously, you can spin the reels thrice for free, representing a chance to earn money without using your gaming credit.\n\nAlternatives to This Slot\nIf Greek mythology is your passion, then you simply must know about another Slot Machine produced by WMS, Zeus. It is one of the most popular slots in Las Vegas. It is a classic, and this time, instead of playing on behalf of Cronus, you will play to enrich Zeus, his son and eternal foe.\n            ",

These electrifying scenes, such as Mount Olympus, always provide fascinating stories that connect various deities, and now, you can enjoy them in a Slot Machine.\n\nAs seasoned gamblers, we know that not only do we need to choose a trustworthy Slot Machine for our wagers, but the visual appeal also plays a significant role.\n\nShould you have a passion for Greek mythology, including their respective temples and divinities, then Kronos Unleashed should be right up your alley. Keep reading to gain insight into everything you need to know about this Slot!\n\nMythical Graphics\nAlthough we stated that the gods are the protagonists of the Slot Machine, that is not necessarily true. The main character of Kronos Unleashed, produced by WMS, is Cronus, the Titan king. Given the name, you may have guessed that this Slot operates within the geographical setting of Mount Othrys, where, according to mythology, the Titans went to war against the Olympian gods.\n\nWhile achieving all your bonuses, you will undoubtedly notice Cronus, muscular arms crossed, looking at you from above the reels. You must do your best to make a good impression on the king of the Titans.\n\nIf you want to bet while observing a burning Greek city in the background, then choosing Kronos Unleashed could be an excellent idea. However, before proceeding, it would be best to know the technical structure and special functions of this Slot Machine.\n\nFunctions and Lightning Respins\nThis particular Slot has a relatively average structure with 60 pay lines on 5 reels. However, if you manage to collect six Cronus symbols of the same color, you can enjoy the Lightning Respins feature, which expands the matrix to a maximum of 100 pay lines. With increased odds of winning, you will undoubtedly begin to notice your growing wealth.\n\nSpecial symbols in this game include the lion, throne, temples, winged Pegasus, and Cronus of different colors. If you are wondering which symbol represents the Wild, it is the temple. Like any respectable Wild, it can replace the value of any symbol, except for the lion and Cronus.\n\nRegarding the Titan king, in addition to triggering the Lightning function in case of a sequence of six identical images, he also represents the Scatter symbol. Should he appear three times simultaneously, you can spin the reels thrice for free, representing a chance to earn money without using your gaming credit.\n\nAlternatives to This Slot\nIf Greek mythology is your passion, then you simply must know about another Slot Machine produced by WMS, Zeus. It is one of the most popular slots in Las Vegas. It is a classic, and this time, instead of playing on behalf of Cronus, you will play to enrich Zeus, his son and eternal foe.\n            ",
