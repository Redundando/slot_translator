The majestic lion, traditionally a guardian in Oriental tradition and a symbol of good fortune in modern casinos, is also featured. With predominant colors of red, blue, and, of course, gold, against a luxurious blue velvet background, the graphics create a pleasing effect, and the soft Asian sound track adds to the immersive experience.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, with 5 reels and 243 pay lines. Wins are awarded for aligning similar symbols on adjacent reels from left to right. With medium to high volatility, don't expect frequent wins, but the payouts can be significant. The return to player (RTP) of 5 Lions is approximately 96%, in line with other Pragmatic Play games.\n\nSymbols on 5 Lions consist of card numbers and letters from nine to Ace. They pay out the least, up to €1,000. Higher payouts apply to the animal symbols inspired by Chinese culture and considered lucky. Sculpted in precious stones and gold, they include a toad, phoenix, fish, turtle, and the iconic dragon, which can pay out up to €5,000. The lion symbol acts as the Wild, can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. Along with being a substitute for other symbols, it also offers a random multiplier up to x40 when it forms a winning combination. The Ying-Yang symbol acts as the Scatter and can award up to 25 free spins, with seven special features enhancing both entertainment and payout possibilities. \n\nIn conclusion, 5 Lions is another excellent game by Pragmatic Play offering a fair RTP and exciting gameplay, making it an ideal option for experienced gamblers.",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay of 5 Lions is fairly straightforward, being a classic five-reel slot with 243 paylines, where wins are awarded for alignments of identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right. This slot is characterized by medium-high volatility (4/5), so while you cannot expect particularly frequent wins, they can be of considerable value.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nThe non-thematic symbols of 5 Lions refer to the numbers and letters of playing cards from 9 to Ace, which among all the symbols pay the least. The thematic symbols have a higher value, including some of the animals considered lucky in Chinese culture, such as the toad, the phoenix, the fish, the turtle, and the dragon. The dragon symbol can bring winnings of up to €5,000. There are 243 paylines in this slot game.\n\nReturn to Player\n\nThe Return to Player of 5 Lions is around 96%, which is typical for most slot games. This developer has chosen a certain homogeneity in the area of player return for its games.

The game has medium-high volatility (4/5), which means that while wins are not particularly frequent, they can be of considerable value.\n\nSymbols and Payouts\n\nThe non-thematic symbols of 5 Lions refer to the numbers and letters of playing cards from 9 to Ace, which pay the least, although they can give up to €1,000. The thematic symbols, on the other hand, have a higher value. Some of the animals considered lucky in Chinese culture, such as the toad, phoenix, fish, turtle, and dragon, are reproduced as if they were sculptures made of precious stones and gold. The dragon, for example, can bring winnings of up to €5,000. The Wild symbol is the lion and can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. In addition to serving as a wild card, when it appears in a winning combination, it offers a random multiplier, up to x40. The Scatter is the Yin Yang and offers up to 25 free spins, during which you can experiment with seven special features, which increase the chances of winning.\n\nReturn to Player\n\nThe Return to Player of 5 Lions is around 96%. This is not surprising as Pragmatic Play has chosen a certain homogeneity in the area of player return for its games. Therefore, all slots developed by this developer are characterized by the same RTP, with very little significant variation.\n\nThematic and Visual Design\n\n5 Lions is centered around Chinese fortune and the dominant figures are the most well-known symbols and amulets of the Chinese culture. The game features predominately red, blue, and gold colors, which are blended to give a pleasant final result. The reels are framed by a gold pattern, representative of the theme, that looms over a background of blue velvet. Additionally, there is an Asian-inspired, soft music that fully immerses you in an atmosphere of oriental-style gaming!\n\nSpecial Features\n\n5 Lions offers a range of special features that increase the fun and winning possibilities. The Wild symbol, which is the lion, offers a random multiplier of up to x40 when it appears in a winning combination. The Scatter is the Yin Yang and offers up to 25 free spins. During the free spins, players can experiment with seven special features that increase the chances of winning.

Additionally, we have the majestic lion, which plays a guardian role in Eastern tradition, while in modern casinos it is considered a lucky figure.\n\nIn terms of graphics, the predominant colors are red, blue, and of course gold, well blended to give a final result that is decidedly pleasant! The reels are framed by a gold pattern that looms over a background of blue velvet, representative of the theme. If the iconographic references and the choice of colors and background are not enough, there is an Asian-inspired, soft music that fully immerses you in an atmosphere of oriental-style gaming!\n\nGameplay and Possibility of Winning\n\nAs for the gameplay, it is fairly straightforward, being a classic five-reel slot with 243 paylines, where wins are awarded for alignments of identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right. This slot is characterized by medium-high volatility (4/5), so while you cannot expect particularly frequent wins, they can be of considerable value.\n\nThe Return to Player of 5 Lions is around 96%, which is not surprising. Pragmatic Play has chosen a certain homogeneity in the area of player return for its games. Therefore, all slots developed by this developer are characterized by the same RTP, with very little significant variation.\n\nSymbols and Their Value\n\nThe non-thematic symbols of 5 Lions refer to the numbers and letters of playing cards from 9 to Ace, which among all the symbols pay the least, although they can give up to €1,000. The thematic symbols have a higher value. Among them, we can find some of the animals considered lucky in Chinese culture, reproduced as if they were sculptures made of precious stones and gold: the toad, the phoenix, the fish, the turtle, and the unmistakable dragon, which can bring winnings of up to €5,000.\n\nThe Wild symbol is the lion protagonist of the slot game, and can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. In addition to serving as a wild card, when it appears in a winning combination, it offers a random multiplier, up to x40! The Scatter is the Yin Yang, offering up to 25 free spins, during which you can experiment with seven special features, which increase the fun and above all the possibilities of winning!\n        ",
