This thrilling game is produced by a provider that is currently making waves.\n\nThe graphics of Harlequin Carnival are stunningly beautiful, and Nolimit City has let its imagination run wild in its latest slot game. The background is a magnificent white stone palace with two inaugural statues on each side. Bright and colorful flowers hang from the outside, making players feel like they're at a Baroque masquerade ball in quintessential Italy. The symbols are immaculate gold playing cards and enticing revelers hidden behind masks. The carnival-themed game boasts many great features, including Nolimit City's popular xNudge element, and many players will enjoy participating in the festivities of this game.\n\nHarlequin Carnival is played with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 paylines. A winning combination is formed when you land 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols on any of the 20 paylines, starting from the first reel.\n\nThe Harlequin Wild symbol, which can award up to 3 Free Spins, is worth keeping an eye on. Appearing on all 5 reels, it will always nudge to be fully visible and grant a wild reel. Each time you spin the reels, the wild multiplier increases by 1. If you land multiple wild multipliers, they will be added together for a total wild multiplier on the payline win.\n\nAn xNudge Harlequin Wild symbol landing will also trigger the Harlequin Respins feature. All xNudge Harlequin wilds move to the left with one free respin awarded on the other reels. The respins continue until reaching the leftmost reel, the first one. The more xNudge Wilds you find during betting, the more respins you will win.\n\nWatch out for the Harlequin Bonus scatter symbols on the central 3 reels, which can be collected during Harlequin Respins. If you collect 3, you will trigger the Harlequin Bonus feature with 8 free spins awarded.\n\nA guaranteed xNudge Harlequin Wild symbol appears on Reel 5 with a 3x multiplier. The multiplier increases by 1 for each leftward move the symbol makes on the reels. The multiplier can increase up to 7x.\n\nOverall, Harlequin Carnival is a fantastic slot game from Nolimit City, with excellent graphics and features that are sure to appeal to experienced gamblers.

Appearing on all 5 reels, it will always nudge to be fully visible and grant a wild reel. Each time you spin the reels, the wild multiplier increases by 1. If you land multiple wild multipliers, they will be added together for a total wild multiplier on the payline win.\n\nAn xNudge Harlequin Wild symbol landing will also trigger the Harlequin Respins feature. All xNudge Harlequin wilds move to the left with one free respin awarded on the other reels. The respins continue until reaching the leftmost reel, the first one. The more xNudge Wilds you find during betting, the more respins you will win.\n\nWatch out for the Harlequin Bonus scatter symbols on the central 3 reels, which can be collected during Harlequin Respins. If you collect 3, you will trigger the Harlequin Bonus feature with 8 free spins awarded.\n\nA guaranteed xNudge Harlequin Wild symbol appears on Reel 5 with a 3x multiplier. The multiplier increases by 1 for each leftward move the symbol makes on the reels. The multiplier can increase up to 7x.\n\nOverall, Harlequin Carnival is a fantastic slot game from Nolimit City, with excellent graphics and features that are sure to appeal to experienced gamblers. Other similar slot games from Nolimit City include Dragon Tribe and Pixies vs Pirates.\n            ",

Players will be transported to a Baroque masquerade ball in Italy with the background of a white stone palace with bright and colorful flowers. The symbols are immaculate gold playing cards and enticing revelers hidden behind masks.\n\nWinning Combinations and Paylines\n\nHarlequin Carnival is a 5-reel, 3-row slot game with 20 paylines. A winning combination is formed when you land 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols on any of the 20 paylines, starting from the first reel.\n\nHarlequin Wild Symbol and Its Functions\n\nThe Harlequin Wild symbol appears on all 5 reels and can award up to 3 Free Spins. It will always nudge to be fully visible and grant a wild reel. Each time you spin the reels, the wild multiplier increases by 1. If you land multiple wild multipliers, they will be added together for a total wild multiplier on the payline win. An xNudge Harlequin Wild symbol landing will also trigger the Harlequin Respins feature, where all xNudge Harlequin wilds move to the left with one free respin awarded on the other reels. The more xNudge Wilds you find during betting, the more respins you will win.\n\nHarlequin Bonus Feature and How to Trigger It\n\nThe Harlequin Bonus feature is triggered when you collect 3 Harlequin Bonus scatter symbols on the central 3 reels during Harlequin Respins. You will be awarded 8 free spins. A guaranteed xNudge Harlequin Wild symbol appears on Reel 5 with a 3x multiplier. The multiplier increases by 1 for each leftward move the symbol makes on the reels. The multiplier can increase up to 7x.\n\n        \n            ",

The graphics of Harlequin Carnival are stunningly beautiful, and players will enjoy participating in the festivities of this game.\n\nxNudge feature\n\nHarlequin Carnival boasts many great features, including Nolimit City's popular xNudge element. An xNudge Harlequin Wild symbol landing will trigger the Harlequin Respins feature, where all xNudge Harlequin wilds move to the left with one free respin awarded on the other reels. The more xNudge Wilds you find during betting, the more respins you will win.\n\nWild multipliers and respins\n\nThe Harlequin Wild symbol, which can award up to 3 Free Spins, is worth keeping an eye on. Appearing on all 5 reels, it will always nudge to be fully visible and grant a wild reel. Each time you spin the reels, the wild multiplier increases by 1. If you land multiple wild multipliers, they will be added together for a total wild multiplier on the payline win. An xNudge Harlequin Wild symbol landing will also trigger the Harlequin Respins feature. All xNudge Harlequin wilds move to the left with one free respin awarded on the other reels. The respins continue until reaching the leftmost reel, the first one. The multiplier increases by 1 for each leftward move the symbol makes on the reels. The multiplier can increase up to 7x.\n\nBonus round and max payout\n\nWatch out for the Harlequin Bonus scatter symbols on the central 3 reels, which can be collected during Harlequin Respins. If you collect 3, you will trigger the Harlequin Bonus feature with 8 free spins awarded. A guaranteed xNudge Harlequin Wild symbol appears on Reel 5 with a 3x multiplier. The maximum payout reaches up to 5,861x.\n\nGameplay and winning combinations\n\nHarlequin Carnival is played with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 paylines. A winning combination is formed when you land 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols on any of the 20 paylines, starting from the first reel.\n\n        \n            ",

This thrilling game is produced by a provider that is currently making waves.\n\nThe graphics of Harlequin Carnival are stunningly beautiful, and Nolimit City has let its imagination run wild in its latest slot game. The background is a magnificent white stone palace with two inaugural statues on each side. Bright and colorful flowers hang from the outside, making players feel like they're at a Baroque masquerade ball in quintessential Italy. The symbols are immaculate gold playing cards and enticing revelers hidden behind masks. The carnival-themed game boasts many great features, including Nolimit City's popular xNudge element, and many players will enjoy participating in the festivities of this game.\n\nHarlequin Carnival is played with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 paylines. A winning combination is formed when you land 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols on any of the 20 paylines, starting from the first reel.\n\nThe Harlequin Wild symbol, which can award up to 3 Free Spins, is worth keeping an eye on. Appearing on all 5 reels, it will always nudge to be fully visible and grant a wild reel. Each time you spin the reels, the wild multiplier increases by 1. If you land multiple wild multipliers, they will be added together for a total wild multiplier on the payline win.\n\nAn xNudge Harlequin Wild symbol landing will also trigger the Harlequin Respins feature. All xNudge Harlequin wilds move to the left with one free respin awarded on the other reels. The respins continue until reaching the leftmost reel, the first one. The more xNudge Wilds you find during betting, the more respins you will win.\n\nWatch out for the Harlequin Bonus scatter symbols on the central 3 reels, which can be collected during Harlequin Respins. If you collect 3, you will trigger the Harlequin Bonus feature with 8 free spins awarded.\n\nA guaranteed xNudge Harlequin Wild symbol appears on Reel 5 with a 3x multiplier. The multiplier increases by 1 for each leftward move the symbol makes on the reels. The multiplier can increase up to 7x.\n\nOverall, Harlequin Carnival is a fantastic slot game from Nolimit City, with excellent graphics and features that are sure to appeal to experienced gamblers. Other similar slot games from Nolimit City include Dragon Tribe and Pixies vs Pirates.\n        ",
