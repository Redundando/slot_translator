    "original_text": "\nMonopoly Electric Wins\nCi sono milioni di giovani che prima della diffusione dei videogiochi passavano ore e ore con gli amici a giocare con i giochi di società. Monopoli è considerato ancora oggi una vera e propria istituzione. Per chi non lo sapesse, lo scopo del gioco è quello di comprare il maggior numero di terreni su cui costruire case e alberghi. Non mancano gli imprevisti, le soste in prigione e le vendite delle proprietà. Monopoly Electric Wins è molto fedele al gioco reale, grazie a un gameplay ingegnoso. Infatti, il tabellone circonda la slot e ci sono due dadi che vengono lanciati in concomitanza con lo Spin. Griglia di gioco, tabellone e simboli sono riprodotti con una grafica al neon, e a fare da sottofondo musicale c’è una drum machine corredata di suoni elettronici.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia ha 6 rulli e 3 righe e ben 729 combinazioni per vincere, ottenute con una serie di simboli adiacenti. La puntata minima è di 0,20 €, la massima di 15 €. È possibile impostare tra i 10 e i 200 giri automatici, con a disposizione alcuni limiti di perdite e di vincita. La volatilità è medio/bassa, ciò vuol dire che si vince spesso ma mai cifre troppo alte. Monopoly Electric Wins ha un buon RTP pari al 96,51%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nNavi, cilindri, dinosauri, automobili, poliziotto, anello, scrigno, cane, il ricco uomo d’affari e il logo della slot sono i simboli che potrete trovare in Monopoly Electric Wins. Il Jolly, rappresentato dalla scritta Wild, sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto quelli speciali. Il vero gioco però si svolge in sinergia con il tabellone. Cliccando il tasto Start, insieme ai rulli verranno lanciati i dati e un cursore si muoverà lungo le caselle, ricompensandoci con bonus, moltiplicatori o altri premi.\nVediamoli nel dettaglio:\n• Imprevisti: alcuni punti interrogativi si posizioneranno sui rulli e prenderanno la forma di un simbolo dopo il giro.\n• Probabilità: il simbolo è il forziere. Atterra su 4 o 9 slot e rivela un simbolo casuale.\n• Stazione: il cursore si sposta su un’altra posizione del tabellone.\n• Anello: in caso di combinazione vincente, rimuove i simboli di basso valore e li sostituisce con altri di alto valore.\n• Acqua potabile: i simboli Jolly vengono posizionati sui rulli in modo casuale.\n• Lampadina elettrica: i Jolly presenti sui rulli vengono trasformati in x2.\n• Parcheggio gratuito: permette di costruire anche senza essere in possesso del set completo di terreni.\n• Vai in prigione: il cursore si posiziona sulla casella prigione sino allo spin successivo.\nIl gioco sul tabellone però non finisce qua. Infatti, quando il cursore si ferma più volte sui terreni liberi dello stesso colore, essi diventeranno di nostra proprietà e potremo costruirci sopra case e hotel. Una volta completate le costruzioni, si avrà diritto a dei giri gratuiti.\n",

Monopoly is still considered a true institution today. For those who don't know, the goal of the game is to buy as many properties as possible to build houses and hotels on. There are unexpected events, stops in jail and property sales. Monopoly Electric Wins is very faithful to the real game, thanks to clever gameplay. In fact, the board surrounds the slot machine and there are two dice that are rolled at the same time as the spin. The game grid, board and symbols are reproduced with neon graphics, and there is a drum machine with electronic sounds playing in the background.\n\nSlot features\nThe grid has 6 reels and 3 rows and 729 combinations to win, obtained with a series of adjacent symbols. The minimum bet is €0.20, the maximum is €15. It is possible to set between 10 and 200 automatic turns, with some loss and win limits available. The volatility is medium/low, which means that you win often but never too high amounts. Monopoly Electric Wins has a good RTP of 96.51%.\n\nSymbols and features\nShips, cylinders, dinosaurs, cars, policeman, ring, chest, dog, rich businessman and the slot logo are the symbols you can find in Monopoly Electric Wins. The Wild, represented by the word Wild, replaces all symbols except for the special ones. However, the real game takes place in synergy with the board. By clicking the Start button, the dice will be rolled along with the reels and a cursor will move along the squares, rewarding us with bonuses, multipliers or other prizes.\n\nLet's see them in detail:\n• Unexpected events: some question marks will be placed on the reels and will become a symbol after the spin.\n• Probability: the symbol is the chest. It lands on 4 or 9 slots and reveals a random symbol.\n• Station: the cursor moves to another position on the board.\n• Ring: in case of a winning combination, it removes low-value symbols and replaces them with high-value ones.\n• Drinking water: Wild symbols are randomly placed on the reels.\n• Light bulb: the Wilds on the reels are transformed into x2.\n• Free parking: allows you to build even without owning the complete set of properties.\n• Go to jail: the cursor lands on the jail square until the next spin.\n\nThe game on the board, however, does not end there. In fact, when the cursor stops multiple times on the free properties of the same color, they become our property and we can build houses and hotels on them. Once the constructions are complete, we will be entitled to free spins.\n            ",

Monopoly is still considered a true institution today. For those who don't know, the goal of the game is to buy as many properties as possible to build houses and hotels on. There are unexpected events, stops in jail and property sales. Monopoly Electric Wins is very faithful to the real game, thanks to clever gameplay. In fact, the board surrounds the slot machine and there are two dice that are rolled at the same time as the spin. The game grid, board and symbols are reproduced with neon graphics, and there is a drum machine with electronic sounds playing in the background.\n\nSlot features\nThe grid has 6 reels and 3 rows and 729 combinations to win, obtained with a series of adjacent symbols. The minimum bet is €0.20, the maximum is €15. It is possible to set between 10 and 200 automatic turns, with some loss and win limits available. The volatility is medium/low, which means that you win often but never too high amounts. Monopoly Electric Wins has a good RTP of 96.51%.\n\nSymbols and features\nShips, cylinders, dinosaurs, cars, policeman, ring, chest, dog, rich businessman and the slot logo are the symbols you can find in Monopoly Electric Wins. The Wild, represented by the word Wild, replaces all symbols except for the special ones. However, the real game takes place in synergy with the board. By clicking the Start button, the dice will be rolled along with the reels and a cursor will move along the squares, rewarding us with bonuses, multipliers or other prizes.\n\nLet's see them in detail:\n• Unexpected events: some question marks will be placed on the reels and will become a symbol after the spin.\n• Probability: the symbol is the chest. It lands on 4 or 9 slots and reveals a random symbol.\n• Station: the cursor moves to another position on the board.\n• Ring: in case of a winning combination, it removes low-value symbols and replaces them with high-value ones.\n• Drinking water: Wild symbols are randomly placed on the reels.\n• Light bulb: the Wilds on the reels are transformed into x2.\n• Free parking: allows you to build even without owning the complete set of properties.\n• Go to jail: the cursor lands on the jail square until the next spin.\n\nThe game on the board, however, does not end there. In fact, when the cursor stops multiple times on the free properties of the same color, they become our property and we can build houses and hotels on them. Once the constructions are complete, we will be entitled to free spins.\n        ",

The image should be in a cartoon style to match the fun and playful nature of the game. The Maya warrior should be wearing glasses to represent intelligence and strategy, which are important elements in Monopoly Electric Wins.
