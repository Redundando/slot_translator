Artemis vs Medusa transforms this ancient setting into action-packed reels in this upcoming Quickspin online slot. \n\nAside from the promising monsters and minotaurs, this real money online slot should have decent value as previous Quickspin online slots. \n\nWill this new Quickspin game offer multipliers, scatters, wilds, and 3D graphics, like another one of the company's releases, the online slot Big Bad Wolf?

Clicking the up and down buttons on the BET field sets your bet per line amount. The number can be anywhere from 1 cent to 5 euros. Multiply it by the number of paylines (25 in total), and you'll get your maximum bet, which is 125 euros. Clicking or touching the SPIN button sets the reels spinning, and you can also set a number of automatic spins if you want to relax while the reels spin and make a lot of money.\n\nThe symbols in Artemis vs Medusa Slot are a broken arrow, grapes, a jug, a pair of winged sandals, a pair of gold earrings, a snake, and a shield. The high paying symbols are a disc depicting a warrior and an ancient Greek temple - five of which pay 5000 coins. The special symbols in the Artemis vs Medusa Slot are few and one of them is Pegasus, the Artemis vs Medusa Slot logo which is the Scatter, a warrior wielding a sword, and the Wild symbol which is the face of Medusa.\n\nThe winnings earned during the base game can be gambled to be doubled. It's the classic Gamble feature. You are taken to a casino table where you can choose the correct card color or suit. In any case, guessing correctly means that the amount you won will be doubled or quadrupled if you guess the right suit. You can play until you lose or until you reach the maximum number of correct choices. \n\nThere are a few extra details that benefit the player during bonuses and extra features. In the case of Free Spins where all winnings are doubled, the player can recover Super Spins by landing the warrior symbol, and if Free Spins are recovered, the player gets ten additional free games.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nThe legendary Medusa is beautiful and fearsome at the same time.

What happens when the Greek goddess Artemis faces off against the legendary monsters, the harpy, the minotaur, and the griffins, and tries to defeat Medusa? The suspense is real. Artemis vs Medusa is scheduled for release on August 11, 2020.\nA battle involving two women from Greek mythology is the inspiration for Artemis vs Medusa, an online slot from Quickspin. Quickspin's previous games have featured refined graphics and strong payouts, so fans of the developer will likely expect nothing less from this mythic battle. When the game is released, check out our review to discover the compatibility, features and gameplay of the online slot Artemis vs Medusa.\nA graphics display worthy of a great battle\nIn Greek mythology, Artemis was the daughter of god Zeus and twin sister to god Apollo. She was the goddess of the moon, nature and protector of the youth, especially young women. So it's only natural that she would oppose Medusa in Quickspin's online slot Artemis vs Medusa.\nMedusa was a Gorgon in mythology, a hideous creature resembling a dragon with snakes for hair. Artemis vs Medusa takes this ancient setting and turns it into action-packed reels in this forthcoming Quickspin online slot game.\nOther than promising monsters and minotaurs, this real money online slot should have decent value, if previous Quickspin online slots are anything to judge by.\nWill this latest Quickspin game offer Multipliers, Scatters, Wilds and 3D graphics just like another of the company's releases, the online slot Big Bad Wolf? Will users be able to obtain bonus spins for big real money wins with the available free spins at Leprechaun Hills? We shall find out soon.\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nFor players who are always on the go, the online slot Artemis vs Medusa will be available on Android or iOS devices. These mobile online slots – as well as versions for tablet and desktop – offer the opportunity to win cash prizes. Plus, you can play them on your phone anywhere!\nPlayers who use the best online slot sites will be on the lookout for a high RTP, such as the solid 97.34% offered with Quickspin's Big Bad Wolf.\nQuickspin games offer different degrees of variance and the maximum payout to cater to both veterans and beginners.\nSetting up the slot machine is easy and fast. You can click up and down buttons on the BET field to set your bet amount per line. The number can be anywhere from 1 cent to 5 euros. Multiply it by the number of paylines (25 in total) and you get your maximum bet which is 125 euros. Clicking or tapping on the SPIN button sets the reels spinning, and you can also set an automatic spins number if you want to relax while the reels spin and bring in loads of cash.\nThe symbols in the Artemis vs Medusa Slot are a broken arrow, grapes, a pitcher, a pair of winged sandals, a pair of gold earrings, a serpent and a shield. The high-paying symbols are a disc depicting a warrior and an ancient Greek temple – five of which pay 5000 coins. The special symbols in the Artemis vs Medusa Slot are a few, including Pegasus, the logo of the Artemis vs Medusa Slot which is the Scatter, a warrior wielding a sword, and the Wild symbol which is Medusa's face.\nWins made during the base game can be played to double them up. It's the classic Gamble feature. You are taken to a casino table where you can guess the right card color or suit. In either case, guessing right means your won amount is doubled or quadrupled if you guessed the right suit. You can play as long as you don't lose or until you reach the maximum number of correct choices.\nThere are a few extra details that benefit the player during bonus rounds and extra features. In the case of Free Spins where all wins are doubled, the player can retrieve Super Spins by landing the warrior symbol, and if Free Games are retrieved the player gets ten additional free games.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nThe legendary Medusa is beautiful and fearsome at the same time.

Not only is the gameplay exciting, but the graphics add an immersive experience like no other.</p><p>When you start the game it's like you’ve been transported to ancient Greece, you can almost feel the cool breeze, admire the wildflowers, and hear the clashing of swords as Artemis fights to defeat Medusa. And talking about Medusa, wait until you get a look at her. With a snake for her hair and eyes that can turn anyone to stone, she's not someone you want to mess with!</p><p>Naturally, Artemis is the hero of this story and she's equally impressive. With her trusty bow and arrow, and a steely determination, she fights to save the day. The symbols of the game perfectly capture the essence of both characters and will keep you engaged as you play.</p><p>So, while you spin the reels, sit back and let your eyes feast on the exquisite graphics. We have no doubt that the beauty and attention to detail in the visuals will continue to enthrall players long after they’ve left the game.</p>\"\n}\n\nOh boy, hold on to your seats because the graphics on this game are of epic proportions! We're not talking about the 8-bit type graphics from the golden age of gaming, but stunning, high-quality, jaw-dropping graphics that will have you gasping.\n\nWhen Quickspin says \"graphics\" they mean it! If it wasn't for the fact that this is a slot game, you might forget that you're not watching a movie on the big screen; that's how impressive the visuals are. The storyline of this battle between Artemis and Medusa is instantly captivating, and the graphics add another thrilling dimension that makes the game even more engaging.\n\nOkay, we have to talk about Medusa because she might just be the most intimidating character in any slot game. She's definitely not someone you want to face on the battlefield or even in a dark alley. Her snake hair may be creepy, but her eyes are the real deal-breaker. We dare you to hold her gaze without blinking!\n\nWhile we're on the topic of characters, let's give Artemis some credit. She's got her hands full with Medusa, but she's not one to back down from a challenge. With her bow and arrow in hand, she's ready to take on anything that comes her way. The symbols in the game do an excellent job of representing both characters and their strengths.\n\nIn short, the graphics in Artemis vs Medusa are a feast for your eyes. The attention to detail and the impressive visuals add a new level of excitement to the gameplay. This game really raises the bar for what slot games should look like. Seriously, if games could win beauty pageants, this one would take the crown."

Artemis vs Medusa is scheduled for release on August 11, 2020.\nA battle involving two women from Greek mythology is the inspiration for Artemis vs Medusa, an online slot from Quickspin.

When the game is released, check out our review to discover the compatibility, features and gameplay of the online slot Artemis vs Medusa.\nA graphics display worthy of a great battle\nIn Greek mythology, Artemis was the daughter of god Zeus and twin sister to god Apollo. She was the goddess of the moon, nature and protector of the youth, especially young women. So it's only natural that she would oppose Medusa in Quickspin's online slot Artemis vs Medusa.\nMedusa was a Gorgon in mythology, a hideous creature resembling a dragon with snakes for hair. Artemis vs Medusa takes this ancient setting and turns it into action-packed reels in this forthcoming Quickspin online slot game.\nOther than promising monsters and minotaurs, this real money online slot should have decent value, if previous Quickspin online slots are anything to judge by.\nWill this latest Quickspin game offer Multipliers, Scatters, Wilds and 3D graphics just like another of the company's releases, the online slot Big Bad Wolf? Will users be able to obtain bonus spins for big real money wins with the available free spins at Leprechaun Hills? We shall find out soon.\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nFor players who are always on the go, the online slot Artemis vs Medusa will be available on Android or iOS devices. These mobile online slots – as well as versions for tablet and desktop – offer the opportunity to win cash prizes.

You can click up and down buttons on the BET field to set your bet amount per line. The number can be anywhere from 1 cent to 5 euros. Multiply it by the number of paylines (25 in total) and you get your maximum bet which is 125 euros. Clicking or tapping on the SPIN button sets the reels spinning, and you can also set an automatic spins number if you want to relax while the reels spin and bring in loads of cash.\nThe symbols in the Artemis vs Medusa Slot are a broken arrow, grapes, a pitcher, a pair of winged sandals, a pair of gold earrings, a serpent and a shield. The high-paying symbols are a disc depicting a warrior and an ancient Greek temple – five of which pay 5000 coins. The special symbols in the Artemis vs Medusa Slot are a few, including Pegasus, the logo of the Artemis vs Medusa Slot which is the Scatter, a warrior wielding a sword, and the Wild symbol which is Medusa's face.\nWins made during the base game can be played to double them up. It's the classic Gamble feature. You are taken to a casino table where you can guess the right card color or suit. In either case, guessing right means your won amount is doubled or quadrupled if you guessed the right suit. You can play as long as you don't lose or until you reach the maximum number of correct choices.\nThere are a few extra details that benefit the player during bonus rounds and extra features. In the case of Free Spins where all wins are doubled, the player can retrieve Super Spins by landing the warrior symbol, and if Free Games are retrieved the player gets ten additional free games.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nThe legendary Medusa is beautiful and fearsome at the same time.

The special symbols in the Artemis vs Medusa Slot are a few, including Pegasus, the logo of the Artemis vs Medusa Slot which is the Scatter, a warrior wielding a sword, and the Wild symbol which is Medusa's face.\nWins made during the base game can be played to double them up. It's the classic Gamble feature. You are taken to a casino table where you can guess the right card color or suit. In either case, guessing right means your won amount is doubled or quadrupled if you guessed the right suit. You can play as long as you don't lose or until you reach the maximum number of correct choices.\nThere are a few extra details that benefit the player during bonus rounds and extra features. In the case of Free Spins where all wins are doubled, the player can retrieve Super Spins by landing the warrior symbol, and if Free Games are retrieved the player gets ten additional free games.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nThe legendary Medusa is beautiful and fearsome at the same time.
