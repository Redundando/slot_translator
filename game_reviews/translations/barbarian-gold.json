    "original_text": "\nBarbarian Gold\nIn questa nuova slot prodotta dalla Iron Dog Studios, il protagonista è un guerriero barbaro che ricorda Conan il distruttore, icona cinematografica degli anni 80 resa celebre dal mitico Arnold Schwarzenegger. Armato di ascia, spada e sfera chiodata, il nostro eroe dovrà sconfiggere il nemico rettiliano e accedere alla grotta di lava e a quella dorata per rubare il tesoro e fare ritorno al suo castello.\nCon Barbarian Gold gli sviluppatori della Iron Dog Studios hanno deciso di puntare su una grafica meno cinematografica e più simile a quella dei cartoon, condita da animazioni legate alle vincite e a una musica avventurosa dal ritmo incalzante. La griglia di gioco ha una cornice di legno con sfondo nero e si trova davanti a un castello medievale. Nella parte sottostante si trova il valore della scommessa e il pulsante per accedere alle impostazioni di gioco, sulla sinistra c’è invece il pulsante per avviare il gioco e quello che dà il via ai giri automatici. L’impostazione di base dei giri automatici è dieci, ma il numero può essere variato accedendo al menù.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nLa griglia ha cinque rulli e tre righe mentre le linee di pagamento sono 20 e sono fisse. Il ritorno teorico al giocatore o RTP si attesta su un buon 96,3%. La volatilità è medio alta,  la puntata minima è di 0,20 € e la massima invece è pari a 20 €. È possibile impostare da 5 sino a 999 giri automatici e decidere dei limiti preventivi per farli interrompere, come ad esempio nel caso si verifichi una vincita o se il denaro diminuisce di un tot deciso da noi.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Barbarian Gold\nLo scopo di questo bel gioco di casa Iron Dog Studios è quello di abbinare da un minimo di tre a un massimo di cinque simboli su una linea vincente. A pagare meno sono i semi delle carte da gioco, seguiti dalla palla chiodata, l’ascia e la spada. I simboli più redditizi sono il nemico rettiliano in forma umana e trasformato da lucertola, oltre naturalmente al guerriero barbaro. Il simbolo Wild è rappresentato dallo scudo con le spade incrociato e la W al centro. Quando appare si espande sino a coprire l’intero rullo, aumentando le possibilità di avere ulteriori combinazioni vincenti in quanto sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter. Lo Scatter è lo scudo con l’osso di toro e in base al numero di simboli sui rulli si avrà un numero diverso di Free Spins: 3 Scatter danno diritto a 8 giri gratuiti, con 4 se ne avranno 10 e con 5 si arriva a 12. A questo punto la schermata cambia e si accede alla grotta di Lava. Anche qui gli Scatter garantiscono ulteriori giri gratuiti, inoltre la comparsa del simbolo Wild a espansione regala un moltiplicatore che già si trova all’interno della Grotta di Lava.\nSe compaiono almeno 3 Scatter nella Grotta di Lava, allora si passerà alla Grotta d’Oro, dove sono previsti ulteriori giri gratuiti e moltiplicatori sempre legati ai simboli Bonus.\n",

Equipped with an axe, sword, and spiked ball, our hero must defeat the lizard enemy and access the lava and golden caves to steal the treasure and return to his castle.\nWith Barbarian Gold, the developers at Iron Dog Studios opted for a less cinematic and more cartoon-like graphics, coupled with animations tied to the winnings and an adventurous music with a fast-paced rhythm. The game grid has a wooden frame with a black background and is placed in front of a medieval castle. The bet value and the button for accessing the game settings are located in the lower section, while on the left-hand side, there is a button for starting the game and one for initiating automatic spins. The default setting for automatic spins is ten, but the number can be changed by accessing the menu.\nMain features of the slot machine\nThe grid has five reels and three rows, while the paylines are fixed at 20. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is a good 96.3%. The volatility is medium-high, the minimum bet is 0.20 €, and the maximum is 20 €. You can set anywhere between 5 and 999 automatic spins and decide on preventive limits to stop them, such as if a win occurs or if the money decreases by a certain amount that is decided by you.\nSymbols and features of Barbarian Gold\nThe goal of this delightful game from Iron Dog Studios is to match a minimum of three to a maximum of five symbols on a winning line. The lowest-paying symbols are the playing card suits, followed by the spiked ball, axe, and sword. The most lucrative symbols are the lizard enemy in human form and lizard form, in addition to the barbarian warrior, of course. The wild symbol is represented by the shield with the crossed swords and the letter \"W\" in the center. When it appears, it expands to cover the entire reel, increasing the chances of getting additional winning combinations since it replaces all symbols except the scatter. The scatter is represented by the shield with the bull's bone, and the number of free spins depends on the number of scatter symbols on the reels: 3 scatters earn 8 free spins, 4 scatters earn 10 free spins, and 5 scatters earn 12 free spins.

The highest-paying symbols are the lizard enemy, lizard form, and the barbarian warrior. The wild symbol is represented by the shield with the crosses swords, and the scatter is a shield with a bull's bone.

The player must guide the barbarian to defeat the lizard enemy and access the lava and golden caves to steal the treasure and return to his castle. The game has less cinematic and more cartoon-like graphics, coupled with animations tied to the winnings and an adventurous music with a fast-paced rhythm.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\n\nBarbarian Gold has a wooden-framed grid with a black background and is placed in front of a medieval castle. The game grid has five reels and three rows, while the paylines are fixed at 20. The volatility is medium-high, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.3%. The minimum bet is 0.20 €, and the maximum is 20 €. The game has an auto-spin feature that can be set anywhere between 5 and 999 automatic spins and decide on preventive limits to stop them.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nThe goal of Barbarian Gold is to match a minimum of three to a maximum of five symbols on a winning line. The lowest-paying symbols are the playing card suits, followed by the spiked ball, axe, and sword. The most lucrative symbols are the lizard enemy in human form and lizard form, in addition to the barbarian warrior. The game has fixed paylines of 20.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nThe wild symbol is represented by the shield with the crossed swords and the letter 'W' in the center. When it appears, it expands to cover the entire reel, increasing the chances of getting additional winning combinations since it replaces all symbols except the scatter. The scatter is represented by the shield with the bull's bone, and the number of free spins depends on the number of scatter symbols on the reels: 3 scatters earn 8 free spins, 4 scatters earn 10 free spins, and 5 scatters earn 12 free spins. If at least 3 scatters appear in the Lava Cave, players will move on to the Gold Cave, where even more free spins and multipliers tied to bonus symbols are waiting.\n\nBonus Features\n\nBarbarian Gold has two bonus features. The first is the Free Spins feature, which is triggered by landing three or more scatter symbols anywhere on the reels, earning players up to 12 free spins. The second bonus feature occurs when players enter the Lava Cave. Here, they can earn more free spins, multipliers, and bonus symbols by landing more scatters or expanding wild symbols. The Gold Cave is the final bonus feature, where players can earn even more free spins and multipliers tied to bonus symbols.\n\n        \n            ",

Equipped with an axe, sword, and spiked ball, our hero must defeat the lizard enemy and access the lava and golden caves to steal the treasure and return to his castle.\nWith Barbarian Gold, the developers at Iron Dog Studios opted for a less cinematic and more cartoon-like graphics, coupled with animations tied to the winnings and an adventurous music with a fast-paced rhythm. The game grid has a wooden frame with a black background and is placed in front of a medieval castle. The bet value and the button for accessing the game settings are located in the lower section, while on the left-hand side, there is a button for starting the game and one for initiating automatic spins. The default setting for automatic spins is ten, but the number can be changed by accessing the menu.\nMain features of the slot machine\nThe grid has five reels and three rows, while the paylines are fixed at 20. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is a good 96.3%. The volatility is medium-high, the minimum bet is 0.20 €, and the maximum is 20 €. You can set anywhere between 5 and 999 automatic spins and decide on preventive limits to stop them, such as if a win occurs or if the money decreases by a certain amount that is decided by you.\nSymbols and features of Barbarian Gold\nThe goal of this delightful game from Iron Dog Studios is to match a minimum of three to a maximum of five symbols on a winning line. The lowest-paying symbols are the playing card suits, followed by the spiked ball, axe, and sword. The most lucrative symbols are the lizard enemy in human form and lizard form, in addition to the barbarian warrior, of course. The wild symbol is represented by the shield with the crossed swords and the letter \"W\" in the center. When it appears, it expands to cover the entire reel, increasing the chances of getting additional winning combinations since it replaces all symbols except the scatter. The scatter is represented by the shield with the bull's bone, and the number of free spins depends on the number of scatter symbols on the reels: 3 scatters earn 8 free spins, 4 scatters earn 10 free spins, and 5 scatters earn 12 free spins. At this point, the screen changes, and you access the lava cave. Here too, scatters guarantee additional free spins, and the appearance of the expanding wild symbol earns a multiplier that is already in the Lava Cave.\nIf at least 3 scatters appear in the Lava Cave, you will move on to the Gold Cave, where even more free spins and multipliers tied to bonus symbols are waiting.\n            ",

Equipped with an axe, sword, and spiked ball, our hero must defeat the lizard enemy and access the lava and golden caves to steal the treasure and return to his castle.\nWith Barbarian Gold, the developers at Iron Dog Studios opted for a less cinematic and more cartoon-like graphics, coupled with animations tied to the winnings and an adventurous music with a fast-paced rhythm. The game grid has a wooden frame with a black background and is placed in front of a medieval castle. The bet value and the button for accessing the game settings are located in the lower section, while on the left-hand side, there is a button for starting the game and one for initiating automatic spins. The default setting for automatic spins is ten, but the number can be changed by accessing the menu.\nMain features of the slot machine\nThe grid has five reels and three rows, while the paylines are fixed at 20. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is a good 96.3%. The volatility is medium-high, the minimum bet is 0.20 €, and the maximum is 20 €. You can set anywhere between 5 and 999 automatic spins and decide on preventive limits to stop them, such as if a win occurs or if the money decreases by a certain amount that is decided by you.\nSymbols and features of Barbarian Gold\nThe goal of this delightful game from Iron Dog Studios is to match a minimum of three to a maximum of five symbols on a winning line. The lowest-paying symbols are the playing card suits, followed by the spiked ball, axe, and sword. The most lucrative symbols are the lizard enemy in human form and lizard form, in addition to the barbarian warrior, of course. The wild symbol is represented by the shield with the crossed swords and the letter \"W\" in the center. When it appears, it expands to cover the entire reel, increasing the chances of getting additional winning combinations since it replaces all symbols except the scatter. The scatter is represented by the shield with the bull's bone, and the number of free spins depends on the number of scatter symbols on the reels: 3 scatters earn 8 free spins, 4 scatters earn 10 free spins, and 5 scatters earn 12 free spins. At this point, the screen changes, and you access the lava cave. Here too, scatters guarantee additional free spins, and the appearance of the expanding wild symbol earns a multiplier that is already in the Lava Cave.\nIf at least 3 scatters appear in the Lava Cave, you will move on to the Gold Cave, where even more free spins and multipliers tied to bonus symbols are waiting.\n            ",
