Don Corlimone, come la maggior parte dei titoli di questa compagnia, sfrutta un meccanismo 5*3 mostrando quindici simboli a ogni giocata.\nLungo le venticinque linee di vincita, un valore abbastanza alto secondo gli standard di questa compagnia, si vanno a disporre le varie combinazioni. Tra i simboli da tenere d’occhio troviamo sicuramente il classico simbolo Wild che sostituisce tutti gli altri e il simbolo Scatter che dà accesso ai giri gratuiti.\nQuest’ultimo è rappresentato da un frutto dietro le sbarre di una gabbia e permette di ottenere un numero variabile di giri gratuiti in base a quanti simboli Scatter troveremo in una singola giocata. Tre simboli conferiscono 5 giri gratuiti, per salire a 10 con quattro simboli e arrivare a 20 con cinque gabbie contemporaneamente.\nTroviamo anche un simbolo Bonus, il pomodoro deceduto, che permette di accedere alla modalità speciale corrispondente.\nSlot simili a Don Corlimone\nDato che Don Corlimone unisce due tematiche molto lontane tra di loro, non è facile suggerire delle slot che possano essere considerate simili dai giocatori.

The title alone answers this question: Capecod has combined the theme of fruit, omnipresent in the world of slots, with that of mafia families and the legendary figure of Don Corleone. The result? A unique slot that we will analyze in detail in this review.\n\nDon Corlimone: visual analysis\n\nAs is to be expected from a slot that boasts such a particular theme, we find a strong attention to detail and visual quality of the symbols within the game grid. Most of these symbols enjoy a revisiting in a fruit-based key of the mafia characters or elements that are part of this world.\n\nIt will therefore take some time to familiarize oneself with all the different symbols, as unfortunately happens when a lot of attention is devoted to their customization: paradoxically, it is much more intuitive to have a slot with 4 special symbols and the other 4 represented by the classic playing cards (A, K...).\n\nOf course, this is only a temporary problem: with a little patience, the graphic style will reward the player's efforts, allowing for a slot that is very enjoyable from a visual point of view.\n\nRegarding music, the sound department of Don Corlimone offers catchy and rhythmic music that is never interrupted even during the game itself, for this reason, some players may choose to turn it off to avoid tiring themselves too much.\n\nDon Corlimone: gameplay mechanics\n\nCapecod never strays too far from its standard RTP of 95%, a guarantee on which we can now count. Don Corlimone, like most of this company's titles, uses a 5*3 mechanism, displaying fifteen symbols each round.\n\nOn the twenty-five pay lines, a value that is quite high according to this company's standards, the various combinations are arranged. Among the symbols to keep an eye on are certainly the classic Wild symbol that substitutes for all the others, and the Scatter symbol that gives access to free spins.\n\nThe latter is represented by a fruit behind the bars of a cage and allows for a variable number of free spins depending on how many Scatter symbols we find during a single round. Three symbols confer 5 free spins, rising to 10 with four symbols and reaching 20 with five cages at the same time.\n\nWe also find a Bonus symbol, the deceased tomato, which allows access to the corresponding special mode.\n\nSimilar slots to Don Corlimone\n\nGiven that Don Corlimone combines two very distant themes, it is not easy to suggest slots that players might consider similar. On the one hand, we have fruit-themed slots, such as Gamomat's Super Duper Cherry, and on the other hand, we have those with mafia themes, such as Pragmatic Play's Catfather, which is closest to Don Corlimone.\n            ",

The game has a Wild symbol that substitutes for all others, a Scatter symbol that triggers free spins with a multiplier, and a Bonus symbol that unlocks special mode. The game mechanics are similar to other slots from Capecod which is a guarantee the player can rely on. \n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nThe graphics in Don Corlimone are of high quality and full of detail, with fruit-based symbols representing various characters and elements in the mafia world. The attention paid to the customization of the symbols might initially cause some confusion to players. The sound department of the game features catchy background music that creates the atmosphere of a slot set in the mafia world. However, music is never interrupted, and players may choose to turn it off if it starts to become overwhelming.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nThe winning potential of Don Corlimone is moderately high due to the 25 pay lines on a 5x3 grid. The highest win in the game is 3,000x the line bet, which is possible when five symbols of one type land on a payline. The game also offers a chance to trigger free spins and bonus rounds, making the game more exciting, and potentially increasing the chances of winning.\n\nBonus Features\n\nDon Corlimone includes a Scatter symbol that triggers free spins feature when three or more of them land on the reels, giving players the chance to win a variable number of free spins. There is also a Bonus symbol, the deceased tomato, which can unlock a special mode with higher winning potential. The game's Wild symbol can increase players' chances of landing winning combinations by substituting for other symbols.\n\nTheme\n\nDon Corlimone combines two themes that seem distant, fruit and mafia, into a unique game. The attention to detail in the symbols gives players an immersive experience into the mafia world. There are not many online slots that are similar to Don Corlimone, but slots such as Gamomat's Super Duper Cherry, and Pragmatic Play's The Catfather are similar in terms of theme.\n\n        \n            ",

For this reason, when a development company, like Capecod in this case, proposes something alternative, it is a pleasure to talk about it and dedicate a thorough review.\n\nWhere is the originality in the Don Corlimone slot? The title alone answers this question: Capecod has combined the theme of fruit, omnipresent in the world of slots, with that of mafia families and the legendary figure of Don Corleone. The result? A unique slot that we will analyze in detail in this review.\n\nDon Corlimone: visual analysis\n\nAs is to be expected from a slot that boasts such a particular theme, we find a strong attention to detail and visual quality of the symbols within the game grid. Most of these symbols enjoy a revisiting in a fruit-based key of the mafia characters or elements that are part of this world.\n\nIt will therefore take some time to familiarize oneself with all the different symbols, as unfortunately happens when a lot of attention is devoted to their customization: paradoxically, it is much more intuitive to have a slot with 4 special symbols and the other 4 represented by the classic playing cards (A, K...).\n\nOf course, this is only a temporary problem: with a little patience, the graphic style will reward the player's efforts, allowing for a slot that is very enjoyable from a visual point of view.\n\nRegarding music, the sound department of Don Corlimone offers catchy and rhythmic music that is never interrupted even during the game itself, for this reason, some players may choose to turn it off to avoid tiring themselves too much.\n\nDon Corlimone: gameplay mechanics\n\nCapecod never strays too far from its standard RTP of 95%, a guarantee on which we can now count. Don Corlimone, like most of this company's titles, uses a 5*3 mechanism, displaying fifteen symbols each round.\n\nOn the twenty-five pay lines, a value that is quite high according to this company's standards, the various combinations are arranged. Among the symbols to keep an eye on are certainly the classic Wild symbol that substitutes for all the others, and the Scatter symbol that gives access to free spins.\n\nThe latter is represented by a fruit behind the bars of a cage and allows for a variable number of free spins depending on how many Scatter symbols we find during a single round. Three symbols confer 5 free spins, rising to 10 with four symbols and reaching 20 with five cages at the same time.\n\nWe also find a Bonus symbol, the deceased tomato, which allows access to the corresponding special mode.\n\nSimilar slots to Don Corlimone\n\nGiven that Don Corlimone combines two very distant themes, it is not easy to suggest slots that players might consider similar. On the one hand, we have fruit-themed slots, such as Gamomat's Super Duper Cherry, and on the other hand, we have those with mafia themes, such as Pragmatic Play's Catfather, which is closest to Don Corlimone.\n            ",

For this reason, when a development company, like Capecod in this case, proposes something alternative, it is a pleasure to talk about it and dedicate a thorough review.\n\nWhere is the originality in the Don Corlimone slot? The title alone answers this question: Capecod has combined the theme of fruit, omnipresent in the world of slots, with that of mafia families and the legendary figure of Don Corleone. The result? A unique slot that we will analyze in detail in this review.\n\nDon Corlimone: visual analysis\n\nAs is to be expected from a slot that boasts such a particular theme, we find a strong attention to detail and visual quality of the symbols within the game grid. Most of these symbols enjoy a revisiting in a fruit-based key of the mafia characters or elements that are part of this world.\n\nIt will therefore take some time to familiarize oneself with all the different symbols, as unfortunately happens when a lot of attention is devoted to their customization: paradoxically, it is much more intuitive to have a slot with 4 special symbols and the other 4 represented by the classic playing cards (A, K...).\n\nOf course, this is only a temporary problem: with a little patience, the graphic style will reward the player's efforts, allowing for a slot that is very enjoyable from a visual point of view.\n\nRegarding music, the sound department of Don Corlimone offers catchy and rhythmic music that is never interrupted even during the game itself, for this reason, some players may choose to turn it off to avoid tiring themselves too much.\n\nDon Corlimone: gameplay mechanics\n\nCapecod never strays too far from its standard RTP of 95%, a guarantee on which we can now count. Don Corlimone, like most of this company's titles, uses a 5*3 mechanism, displaying fifteen symbols each round.\n\nOn the twenty-five pay lines, a value that is quite high according to this company's standards, the various combinations are arranged. Among the symbols to keep an eye on are certainly the classic Wild symbol that substitutes for all the others, and the Scatter symbol that gives access to free spins.\n\nThe latter is represented by a fruit behind the bars of a cage and allows for a variable number of free spins depending on how many Scatter symbols we find during a single round. Three symbols confer 5 free spins, rising to 10 with four symbols and reaching 20 with five cages at the same time.\n\nWe also find a Bonus symbol, the deceased tomato, which allows access to the corresponding special mode.\n\nSimilar slots to Don Corlimone\n\nGiven that Don Corlimone combines two very distant themes, it is not easy to suggest slots that players might consider similar. On the one hand, we have fruit-themed slots, such as Gamomat's Super Duper Cherry, and on the other hand, we have those with mafia themes, such as Pragmatic Play's Catfather, which is closest to Don Corlimone.\n            ",
