Vittorie successive a valanga aumentano un moltiplicatore. Guarda fuori anche per i wilds in espansione con moltiplicatori tra 2x e 6x, respins e un bonus round che assegna giri gratuiti con moltiplicatori in espansione. Gioca su tutti i dispositivi a partire da 10 centesimi e 80€ per giro.\nUna grafica semplice ma d’effetto\nUn aspetto in cui Medallion Megaways si distingue indiscutibilmente è il reparto visivo. Ambientato in una tenda di lusso nel deserto sahariano, Fantasma è riuscito a forgiare un’ambientazione piuttosto atmosferica con un sacco di intimità e calore. E se sei impressionato dall’atmosfera ariosa, aspetta solo di attivare il bonus. È lì che avviene la magia, dopo tutto. In Medallion Megaways, i simbolli sono costituiti essenzialmente da un assortimento di pietre preziose simile a quello scelto negli altri giochi prodotti da Fantasma Games, ma quelle di alto valore sono ora contrassegnate da triangoli, mezzelune e stelle. Il simbolo più remunerativo, tuttavia, è quello che porta il serpente d’oro – ti darà 30 volte la tua puntata per sei su una linea di pagamento. Il cristallo è il simbolo Wild e appare sui rulli 2-5. Oltre a sostituire tutti i simboli regolari, ha anche altre proprietà, di cui parleremo più avanti.\nCome la maggior parte delle slot Megaways, Medallion Megaways si gioca utilizzando le bobine a cascata, il che significa che i simboli vincenti vengono rimossi e sostituiti con quelli nuovi, permettendoti di vincere ripetutamente da un singolo giro. C’è anche un moltiplicatore di vincita nel gioco base che aumenta di 1x con ogni cascata successiva e si azzera quando non si vince.\nPer prima cosa, diamo un’occhiata ai dettagli tecnici. Medallion Megaways è una video slot a griglia 6×6 con rulli a cascata che possono produrre un numero casuale di modi di vincere da 64 a 46.656. Varianza media e giocabile da 10 centesimi a 80 euro per giro, incorpora wilds in espansione, respins e un gioco di giri gratuiti con un moltiplicatore crescente.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nCi sono anche un paio di medaglioni misteriosi da tenere d’occhio. Questi possono apparire dopo ogni giro del gioco base per attivare (medaglione d’oro) o disattivare (medaglione d’argento) gli amuleti delle caratteristiche, che sono posizionati sotto la serie di rulli, e le loro caratteristiche corrispondenti. Queste caratteristiche sono:\nExpanding Wilds – quando l’amuleto wild viene attivato, tutti i crystal wilds che atterrano sui rulli 2-5 si espandono fino a coprire completamente i rulli. Inoltre, ogni expansion wild porta anche un moltiplicatore di 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, o 6x.\nVoid Respin – quando l’amuleto respin è in gioco, il simbolo void respin può apparire in vista. Ognuno di questi atterraggi sui rulli rimuoverà 2-10 simboli che non fanno parte di alcuna combinazione vincente.\nLa funzione Free Spins viene attivata nello stesso modo – il medaglione d’oro appare e attiva l’amuleto dei giri gratuiti. Con 10 giri gratuiti assegnati (che non possono essere riattivati), il moltiplicatore di vincita non si azzera durante il round ed entrambe le funzioni expanding wild e void respin sono attive per tutto il tempo.\nLa verità è che Medallion Megaways è una slot significativamente addomesticata, o almeno così sembra a noi. Alla fine della nostra prova di 3 ore, l’equilibrio sembrava quasi essere rimasto statico, il che significa che può servire come un’eccellente alternativa per coloro che cercano un certo valore sotto forma di tempo di gioco. I colpi da 15-30x del gioco base sono consegnati in modo abbastanza consistente, e raramente si deve aspettare troppo a lungo per il rilascio di un bonus.

            "response": "Medallion Megaways Review:\n\nStep into a luxurious tent in the heart of the desert, an unusual setting for a video slot game. Medallion Megaways, developed by Fantasma Games, features 6 reels and a variable number of paylines, ranging from 64 to 46,656. Trigger successive wins to increase your winnings with a multiplier feature. Keep an eye out for expanding wilds with multipliers ranging from 2x to 6x, respins, and a bonus round that awards free spins with expanding multipliers. Play on any device and bet from 10 cents to 80€ per spin.\n\nVisually, Medallion Megaways is a standout with its atmospheric environment of a luxurious tent in the Saharan desert. The assortment of symbols is mainly precious stones, with high-value symbols marked with triangles, crescents and stars. The most lucrative symbol is the golden serpent, which pays out 30 times your bet for six on a payline. The crystal is the wild symbol and appears on reels 2 to 5, substituting for all regular symbols and offering further features.\n\nAs with most Megaways slots, Medallion Megaways has cascading reels, meaning winning symbols are removed and replaced with new ones. The win multiplier increases by 1x with each successive cascade and resets when there are no wins.\n\nKeep an eye out for a couple of elusive medallions, appearing after each base game spin to activate (the gold medallion) or deactivate (the silver medallion) amulet features and their corresponding characteristics. These features include expanding wilds, where the crystal wilds on reels 2 to 5 expand to cover the reels, each with a multiplier of 2x to 6x. The void respin removes 2 to 10 symbols that do not form a winning combination. The free spins feature is activated the same way - with 10 free spins awarded (which cannot be reactivated), the win multiplier does not reset during the round, with expanding wild and void respin features active throughout.\n\nOverall, Medallion Megaways is a relatively low-volatility slot game, which can serve as a great alternative for those seeking value in terms of playtime. The hits of 15-30x in the base game come quite consistently, and the bonus is rarely too far away. Despite the low volatility, there is still a lot of potential with a maximum payout of around 12,000 times your bet.\n\nIn conclusion, the visual design is superb, along with the sound effects. However, it is a little strange to see the Megaways counter displaying six-digit numbers when, mathematically, the game can generate \"only\" 46,656 ways to win. Nevertheless, Medallion Megaways is a decent slot game, though the novelty of the concept may have worn off, making it feel a bit passé.\n\nIf you enjoyed playing Medallion Megaways, then we highly recommend Bonanza Megaways by Big Time Gaming, played on the developer's Megaways engine, featuring up to 117,649 winning combinations. It comes with a free spins feature with expanding multipliers and a chance to win up to 26,000x your bet on each free spin.",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Medallion Megaways\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nMedallion Megaways Review:\n\nStep into a luxurious tent in the heart of the desert, an unusual setting for a video slot game. Medallion Megaways, developed by Fantasma Games, features 6 reels and a variable number of paylines, ranging from 64 to 46,656. Trigger successive wins to increase your winnings with a multiplier feature. Keep an eye out for expanding wilds with multipliers ranging from 2x to 6x, respins, and a bonus round that awards free spins with expanding multipliers. Play on any device and bet from 10 cents to 80€ per spin.\n\nVisually, Medallion Megaways is a standout with its atmospheric environment of a luxurious tent in the Saharan desert. The assortment of symbols is mainly precious stones, with high-value symbols marked with triangles, crescents and stars. The most lucrative symbol is the golden serpent, which pays out 30 times your bet for six on a payline. The crystal is the wild symbol and appears on reels 2 to 5, substituting for all regular symbols and offering further features.\n\nAs with most Megaways slots, Medallion Megaways has cascading reels, meaning winning symbols are removed and replaced with new ones. The win multiplier increases by 1x with each successive cascade and resets when there are no wins.\n\nKeep an eye out for a couple of elusive medallions, appearing after each base game spin to activate (the gold medallion) or deactivate (the silver medallion) amulet features and their corresponding characteristics. These features include expanding wilds, where the crystal wilds on reels 2 to 5 expand to cover the reels, each with a multiplier of 2x to 6x. The void respin removes 2 to 10 symbols that do not form a winning combination. The free spins feature is activated the same way - with 10 free spins awarded (which cannot be reactivated), the win multiplier does not reset during the round, with expanding wild and void respin features active throughout.\n\nOverall, Medallion Megaways is a relatively low-volatility slot game, which can serve as a great alternative for those seeking value in terms of playtime. The hits of 15-30x in the base game come quite consistently, and the bonus is rarely too far away. Despite the low volatility, there is still a lot of potential with a maximum payout of around 12,000 times your bet.\n\nIn conclusion, the visual design is superb, along with the sound effects. However, it is a little strange to see the Megaways counter displaying six-digit numbers when, mathematically, the game can generate \"only\" 46,656 ways to win. Nevertheless, Medallion Megaways is a decent slot game, though the novelty of the concept may have worn off, making it feel a bit passé.\n\nIf you enjoyed playing Medallion Megaways, then we highly recommend Bonanza Megaways by Big Time Gaming, played on the developer's Megaways engine, featuring up to 117,649 winning combinations. It comes with a free spins feature with expanding multipliers and a chance to win up to 26,000x your bet on each free spin.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame Description\nFeatures\nPayout Potential\nDevice Compatibility\nSimilar Games\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Medallion Megaways Review:\n\nStep into a luxurious tent in the heart of the desert, an unusual setting for a video slot game. Medallion Megaways, developed by Fantasma Games, features 6 reels and a variable number of paylines, ranging from 64 to 46,656. Trigger successive wins to increase your winnings with a multiplier feature. Keep an eye out for expanding wilds with multipliers ranging from 2x to 6x, respins, and a bonus round that awards free spins with expanding multipliers. Play on any device and bet from 10 cents to 80€ per spin.\n\nVisually, Medallion Megaways is a standout with its atmospheric environment of a luxurious tent in the Saharan desert. The assortment of symbols is mainly precious stones, with high-value symbols marked with triangles, crescents and stars. The most lucrative symbol is the golden serpent, which pays out 30 times your bet for six on a payline. The crystal is the wild symbol and appears on reels 2 to 5, substituting for all regular symbols and offering further features.\n\nAs with most Megaways slots, Medallion Megaways has cascading reels, meaning winning symbols are removed and replaced with new ones. The win multiplier increases by 1x with each successive cascade and resets when there are no wins.\n\nKeep an eye out for a couple of elusive medallions, appearing after each base game spin to activate (the gold medallion) or deactivate (the silver medallion) amulet features and their corresponding characteristics. These features include expanding wilds, where the crystal wilds on reels 2 to 5 expand to cover the reels, each with a multiplier of 2x to 6x. The void respin removes 2 to 10 symbols that do not form a winning combination. The free spins feature is activated the same way - with 10 free spins awarded (which cannot be reactivated), the win multiplier does not reset during the round, with expanding wild and void respin features active throughout.\n\nOverall, Medallion Megaways is a relatively low-volatility slot game, which can serve as a great alternative for those seeking value in terms of playtime. The hits of 15-30x in the base game come quite consistently, and the bonus is rarely too far away. Despite the low volatility, there is still a lot of potential with a maximum payout of around 12,000 times your bet.\n\nIn conclusion, the visual design is superb, along with the sound effects. However, it is a little strange to see the Megaways counter displaying six-digit numbers when, mathematically, the game can generate \"only\" 46,656 ways to win. Nevertheless, Medallion Megaways is a decent slot game, though the novelty of the concept may have worn off, making it feel a bit passé.\n\nIf you enjoyed playing Medallion Megaways, then we highly recommend Bonanza Megaways by Big Time Gaming, played on the developer's Megaways engine, featuring up to 117,649 winning combinations. It comes with a free spins feature with expanding multipliers and a chance to win up to 26,000x your bet on each free spin.\n            ",

Medallion Megaways, developed by Fantasma Games, features 6 reels and a variable number of paylines, ranging from 64 to 46,656. Trigger successive wins to increase your winnings with a multiplier feature. Keep an eye out for expanding wilds with multipliers ranging from 2x to 6x, respins, and a bonus round that awards free spins with expanding multipliers. Play on any device and bet from 10 cents to 80€ per spin.\n\nVisually, Medallion Megaways is a standout with its atmospheric environment of a luxurious tent in the Saharan desert. The assortment of symbols is mainly precious stones, with high-value symbols marked with triangles, crescents and stars. The most lucrative symbol is the golden serpent, which pays out 30 times your bet for six on a payline. The crystal is the wild symbol and appears on reels 2 to 5, substituting for all regular symbols and offering further features.\n\nAs with most Megaways slots, Medallion Megaways has cascading reels, meaning winning symbols are removed and replaced with new ones. The win multiplier increases by 1x with each successive cascade and resets when there are no wins.\n\nKeep an eye out for a couple of elusive medallions, appearing after each base game spin to activate (the gold medallion) or deactivate (the silver medallion) amulet features and their corresponding characteristics. These features include expanding wilds, where the crystal wilds on reels 2 to 5 expand to cover the reels, each with a multiplier of 2x to 6x. The void respin removes 2 to 10 symbols that do not form a winning combination. The free spins feature is activated the same way - with 10 free spins awarded (which cannot be reactivated), the win multiplier does not reset during the round, with expanding wild and void respin features active throughout.\n\nOverall, Medallion Megaways is a relatively low-volatility slot game, which can serve as a great alternative for those seeking value in terms of playtime. The hits of 15-30x in the base game come quite consistently, and the bonus is rarely too far away. Despite the low volatility, there is still a lot of potential with a maximum payout of around 12,000 times your bet.\n\nIn conclusion, the visual design is superb, along with the sound effects. However, it is a little strange to see the Megaways counter displaying six-digit numbers when, mathematically, the game can generate \"only\" 46,656 ways to win. Nevertheless, Medallion Megaways is a decent slot game, though the novelty of the concept may have worn off, making it feel a bit passé.\n\nIf you enjoyed playing Medallion Megaways, then we highly recommend Bonanza Megaways by Big Time Gaming, played on the developer's Megaways engine, featuring up to 117,649 winning combinations. It comes with a free spins feature with expanding multipliers and a chance to win up to 26,000x your bet on each free spin.\n            ",

Medallion Megaways, developed by Fantasma Games, features 6 reels and a variable number of paylines, ranging from 64 to 46,656. Trigger successive wins to increase your winnings with a multiplier feature. Keep an eye out for expanding wilds with multipliers ranging from 2x to 6x, respins, and a bonus round that awards free spins with expanding multipliers. Play on any device and bet from 10 cents to 80€ per spin.\n\nVisually, Medallion Megaways is a standout with its atmospheric environment of a luxurious tent in the Saharan desert. The assortment of symbols is mainly precious stones, with high-value symbols marked with triangles, crescents and stars. The most lucrative symbol is the golden serpent, which pays out 30 times your bet for six on a payline. The crystal is the wild symbol and appears on reels 2 to 5, substituting for all regular symbols and offering further features.\n\nAs with most Megaways slots, Medallion Megaways has cascading reels, meaning winning symbols are removed and replaced with new ones. The win multiplier increases by 1x with each successive cascade and resets when there are no wins.\n\nKeep an eye out for a couple of elusive medallions, appearing after each base game spin to activate (the gold medallion) or deactivate (the silver medallion) amulet features and their corresponding characteristics. These features include expanding wilds, where the crystal wilds on reels 2 to 5 expand to cover the reels, each with a multiplier of 2x to 6x. The void respin removes 2 to 10 symbols that do not form a winning combination. The free spins feature is activated the same way - with 10 free spins awarded (which cannot be reactivated), the win multiplier does not reset during the round, with expanding wild and void respin features active throughout.\n\nOverall, Medallion Megaways is a relatively low-volatility slot game, which can serve as a great alternative for those seeking value in terms of playtime. The hits of 15-30x in the base game come quite consistently, and the bonus is rarely too far away. Despite the low volatility, there is still a lot of potential with a maximum payout of around 12,000 times your bet.\n\nIn conclusion, the visual design is superb, along with the sound effects. However, it is a little strange to see the Megaways counter displaying six-digit numbers when, mathematically, the game can generate \"only\" 46,656 ways to win. Nevertheless, Medallion Megaways is a decent slot game, though the novelty of the concept may have worn off, making it feel a bit passé.\n\nIf you enjoyed playing Medallion Megaways, then we highly recommend Bonanza Megaways by Big Time Gaming, played on the developer's Megaways engine, featuring up to 117,649 winning combinations. It comes with a free spins feature with expanding multipliers and a chance to win up to 26,000x your bet on each free spin.\n            ",
