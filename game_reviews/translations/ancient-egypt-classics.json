Players can potentially earn large payouts, but wins are not frequently obtained.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nThe graphics in Ancient Egypt Classic are simple but well done. Players find themselves in front of a temple dedicated to Egyptian deities. Symbols on the reels also reference these gods, resulting in an immersive experience.\n\nSymbols and Theme\n\nThe symbols in Ancient Egypt Classic are a mix of thematic and non-thematic references. Non-thematic symbols include playing cards from 10 to Ace. Thematic symbols include hieroglyphs, the cross of life, the Eye of Horus, Anubis, and Queen Cleopatra. The Golden Scarab acts as the Wild symbol, which is an essential part of Egyptian culture and can bring players wins up to x200.\n\nSpecial Feature: Golden Scarab and Free Spins\n\nThe Golden Scarab represents the Wild symbol and can bring players wins up to x200. In addition, the Golden Scarab can grant players access to free spins. Unfortunately, the slot does not offer many special features besides this.\n\nComparison to Other Ancient Egypt-Themed Slots\n\nThere are many slots with an Ancient Egypt theme in online casinos. Some notable examples include Ramses Treasures, Sphinx, Ramses Riches, Golden Ark, Queen of Riches, A While on the Nile, Hidden, Horus Gold, Blaze of Ra, Rise of Ra, and Platinum Pyramid. While Ancient Egypt Classic may lack many special features compared to other Egypt-themed slots, the game still provides a rewarding and immersive experience.\n\n        \n            ",

One of the most famous is the Book of Ra series, which is one of the most beloved slot machines by players all over the world.\n\nAncient Egypt Classic is the slot machine by Pragmatic Play dedicated to the Pharaohs, in a journey back in time to the era of pyramids, characterized by a very simple but well-structured game.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it is a rather classic slot machine, with five reels, ten paylines, and an RTP of 96.47%, which is within the average of Pragmatic games. The volatility of Ancient Egypt Classic is high, which means that potentially you can get quite consistent wins, but they are not very frequent.\n\nThe graphics of Ancient Egypt Classic are essential, but very well curated: we find ourselves at the entrance of a temple dedicated to the Egyptian deities and even the symbols found on the reels reproduce the gods.\n\nOverall, this slot does not have many special features, but is limited to those determined by the special Wild symbol, which makes it very easy and intuitive, for a gaming experience that is rewarding and immersive.\n\nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters\n\nThe symbols of Ancient Egypt Classic are divided into thematic and non-thematic, and there is only one special Wild symbol present.\n\nAmong the non-thematic icons, we find, as often happens, the numbers and letters that indicate the playing cards, in this case from 10 to Ace, while among the thematic symbols we have very classic references to the culture of Ancient Egypt. There are hieroglyphs, the so-called cross of life, the Eye of Horus, and the god Anubis, then there is Queen Cleopatra, who, if she appears on four reels from 2 to 5, allows you to obtain a win equal to 500 times the bet.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by the Golden Scarab, so important in Egyptian culture, which will bring a win up to x200 the bet depending on how many times it appears on the reels. In addition, the Golden Scarab will also allow access to free spins.\n\nSlots similar to Ancient Egypt Classic\n\nAs already mentioned, the theme of Ancient Egypt is one of the most exploited in slot machines, and there are really many games that take place in the shadow of the pyramids. We leave you a short list of such slots that you can find in major online casinos, also available in Play For Fun mode, without registration and without having to bet real money:\n\n- Ramses Treasures\n- Sphinx\n- Ramses Riches\n- Golden Ark\n- Queen of Riches\n- A While on the Nile\n- Hidden\n- Horus Gold\n- Blaze of Ra\n- Rise of Ra\n- Platinum Pyramid\n\n…and many more!\n        ",
