Get ready to be blown away by this slot game full of colors and excitement.\n\nWith its beautiful graphics, this game will transport you to the endless green fields of Ireland, with the rainbow in clear sight. While the graphics might not be the absolute best, the large symbols make it easy to understand when you've won a combo and the buttons are placed outside the screen, so they won't get in the way of your gameplay. Accompanied by a mix of relaxing flutes and natural sounds such as flowing rivers and chirping birds, the music sets the perfect atmosphere for the game.\n\nDouble Lucky Mushrooms DoubleMax features a 5x3 grid and 20 fixed paylines, with each spin costing €0,20, but the bet can be raised at will. Like many slot games, this one also offers the possibility of setting automatic spins, but with the requirement to set limits on losses, after which the Autoplay will stop.\n\nThe game's volatility is high, with the theoretical return to player (RTP) being 95.5%.\n\nThe regular symbols in the game include seven different ones, with the playing cards occupying the lowest position in the value scale, followed by the green cylinder, mushrooms, and the game's logo.\n\nAs for the special symbols, Double Lucky Mushrooms DoubleMax features two Wilds: the first is the pot of gold coins, which substitutes all symbols except for the other special ones, and the second is the expanding Wild clover, which expands to cover the entire reel when it lands.\n\nThe fairy is the Scatter symbol and, depending on how many times it appears, will reward you with 8 to 16 Free Spins, which can be increased before starting the spins by spinning a wheel. However, be careful, because there is also a chance of losing the free spins.\n\nDuring the Free Spins feature, mushroom symbols take on a random monetary value, while fairy symbols turn into multipliers.\n\nThe well is another Scatter symbol that, when three appear on the reels, gives you the chance to win a relatively high sum.\n\nExperience the magic of Double Lucky Mushrooms DoubleMax today, with a demo version available on our website for you to try out the game before betting with real money. Play this HTML5 game on any device, whether it be Android or iOS. With 20 fixed paylines, there are plenty of chances to win big in this exciting slot game.\n        ",
