    "original_text": "\nHorror Hotel\nSolo i cuori impavidi potranno alloggiare all’Horror Hotel, la slot Relax Gaming abitata da mummie, licantropi, il conte Dracula e Frankenstein!\nUna grafica d’impatto\nLa nuova slot di Relax Gaming è un vero e proprio viaggio nella cultura horror della letteratura e cinematografia di genere. Ad essere celebrati sono i personaggi che più di tutti hanno terrorizzato il cuore delle persone, come il conte Dracula, Frankenstein, la mummia e l’uomo lupo.\nPer creare una slot all’altezza delle aspettative, la software house fondata nel 2010 ha lavorato molto e bene sulla grafica. Sullo sfondo non notiamo un hotel isolato tipo il Bates Motel di Psycho, ma il castello di Dracula e in primo piano un bel cimitero decadente con tanto di alberi scheletrici e teschi sparsi vicino alle tombe.\nI simboli sono ben disegnati in stile cartoon, con qualche animazione a rendere più vivace il gioco. Ad esempio, quando otteniamo una combo con Dracula, vedremo il principe della notte trasformarsi per un attimo in pipistrello, a Frankenstein invece si solleverà la calotta cranica.\nLa musica è un motivetto ricco di mistero che ricrea la giusta tensione durante le giocate.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nIn Horror Hotel troviamo una griglia di forma quadrata, con 6 bobine e 6 righe. Si vince creando cluster di almeno 5 simboli identici a salire sino a più di 30. La puntata base è di 0,10 € a giro e si può vincere sino a un massimo di 20.000x la puntata.\nFunzioni speciali sono il classico Autoplay e il Turbo, che accelera la caduta dei simboli.\nLa volatilità è alta, mentre il ritorno teorico al giocatore è del 96,17%.\nCome giocare a Horror Hotel\nIl sistema di gioco di Horror Hotel è a cascata, ma una versione rivisitata. Infatti, quando creiamo gruppi di simboli identici, tutti quelli non paganti scompaiono, mentre quelli vincenti cadono in basso e vengono sostituiti da un simbolo misterioso. Durante il successivo Respin, il Mistery Symbol prenderà le sembianze di un simbolo di pagamento. Se otteniamo un’altra vincita, si continua con questa funzione.\nPassiamo ora ai simboli. Le tre pozioni di colori differenti sono i simboli che pagano meno. A seguire troviamo la mummia, l’uomo lupo, Frankenstein e Dracula.\nIl Wild sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter, qui rappresentato da teschio dorato. Quando otteniamo 3 simboli speciali in un unico giro, otterremo 5 giri gratuiti, che si svolgeranno all’interno dell’Hotel. La funzione Mistery Symbol è attiva anche durante il gioco Bonus. A ogni Free Spins, vedremo atterrare un Wild, inoltre ogni volta che si verificherà un cluster vincente, vedremo il moltiplicatore sono alla sinistra delle griglia aumentare di +1. Ogni Scatter che compare durante la funzione speciale regala un ulteriore Free Spins.\nQuesto Bonus può essere anche acquistato.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nA quanto corrisponde il ritorno teorico al giocatore?\n\nIl valore RTP si attesta su un buon 96,17%.\n \n\n\n\nHo letto che Horror Hotel sfrutta un sistema a cluster. Che significa?\n\nVuol dire che per vincere non è necessario creare combo vincenti da sinistra a destra, ma gruppi di simboli vincenti in ogni posizione, orizzontale a verticale, basta che siano adiacenti.\n\n\n\nPosso giocare anche su Tablet e Smartphone?\n\nSì. Oltre che per pc, Horror Hotel è disponibile per tutti i dispositivi mobili.\n\n\n\n",

The grid is composed of 6 reels and 6 rows, and the slot features a cascading gameplay system. The theoretical return to the player is 96.17%, and the volatility is high. To win more than 30 clusters, a maximum win of 20,000x the bet is available. Players can use the Autoplay feature and the Turbo mode.\n\nDetailed Review of Horror Hotel Symbol Design and Graphics\n\nHorror Hotel slot features graphics based on characters frequently portrayed in horror literature and adaptations. This includes Count Dracula, the mummy, Frankenstein, and the werewolf. The background is set in Dracula's castle, and the foreground reveals a decadent cemetery, with skeletons and scattered skulls near the tombs. The music is a mysterious tune created to add tension to the gameplay. The symbols in the game are well-designed with animations that bring the game to life. For example, Dracula turns into a bat when a combo is achieved.\n\nDetailed Review of Horror Hotel Special Features\n\nHorror Hotel slot features a bonus game that is triggered when three golden skulls appear on the grid. This will give players five free spins to play, and the game takes place inside the hotel. With each free spin, a Wild symbol will land, and the multiplier will increase by +1. The Mystery Symbol is also active during the Bonus game, and each Scatter symbol that appears during the special feature will give players an additional Free Spin. Additionally, players can purchase the Bonus Round. Horror Hotel also features Wild symbols that replace normal symbols to form winning clusters, with the exception of the Scatter symbols.\n\nDetailed Review of Horror Hotel Mobile Compatibility\n\nHorror Hotel by Relax Gaming is available for all mobile devices, including tablets and smartphones, in addition to PC. The game features responsive design that adjusts to any screen size to ensure players can play from anywhere.\n\nDetailed Review of Horror Hotel Return to Player Percentage\n\nThe theoretical return to player percentage for Horror Hotel slot is 96.17%, which is considered above average. This means that on average, players can expect to win back $0.96 for every $1 they wager on the game, although this is a long-term average, and individual sessions will vary.

The characters that have frightened people's hearts the most are celebrated, such as Count Dracula, Frankenstein, the mummy, and the werewolf.\n\nTo create a slot that was up to expectations, the software house founded in 2010 worked hard on the graphics. In the background, we don't see an isolated hotel like the Bates Motel from Psycho, but Dracula's castle, and in the foreground, a beautiful decadent cemetery with skeleton trees and skulls scattered near the tombs.\n\nThe symbols are well-designed in a cartoon style, with some animation to make the game more lively. For example, when we get a combo with Dracula, we will see the prince of the night transform into a bat for a moment, while Frankenstein's skullcap lifts up.\n\nThe music is a mysterious tune that recreates the right tension during the gameplay.\n\nSlot features\nIn Horror Hotel, we find a square grid with 6 reels and 6 rows. We win by creating clusters of at least 5 identical symbols, up to more than 30. The basic bet is €0.10 per spin, and you can win up to a maximum of 20,000x the bet.\n\nSpecial features include the classic Autoplay and Turbo, which accelerates the fall of the symbols. The volatility is high, while the theoretical return to the player is 96.17%.\n\nHow to play Horror Hotel\nThe gameplay system of Horror Hotel is cascading, but a revised version. In fact, when we create groups of identical symbols, all the non-paying ones disappear, while the winning ones fall down and are replaced by a mysterious symbol. During the next Respin, the Mistery Symbol will take on the appearance of a paying symbol. If we obtain another win, we continue with this feature.\n\nLet's now move on to the symbols. The three potions of different colors are the symbols that pay the least. Then we find the mummy, the werewolf, Frankenstein, and Dracula.\n\nThe Wild symbol replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by a golden skull. When we get 3 special symbols in a single spin, we will get 5 free spins, which will take place inside the Hotel. The Mistery Symbol feature is also active during the Bonus game. With each Free Spin, we will see a Wild land, and each time a winning cluster occurs, we will see the multiplier increase by +1 to the left of the grid. Each Scatter that appears during the special feature gives an additional Free Spin.\n\nThis Bonus can also be purchased.\n\nFAQs\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nThe RTP value is a good 96.17%.\n\nI read that Horror Hotel uses a cluster system. What does that mean?\n\nIt means that to win, it is not necessary to create winning combos from left to right, but winning groups of symbols in any position, horizontally or vertically, as long as they are adjacent.\n\nCan I play on tablets and smartphones?\n\nYes, in addition to the PC, Horror Hotel is available for all mobile devices.\n            ",

The characters that have frightened people's hearts the most are celebrated, such as Count Dracula, Frankenstein, the mummy, and the werewolf.\n\nTo create a slot that was up to expectations, the software house founded in 2010 worked hard on the graphics. In the background, we don't see an isolated hotel like the Bates Motel from Psycho, but Dracula's castle, and in the foreground, a beautiful decadent cemetery with skeleton trees and skulls scattered near the tombs.\n\nThe symbols are well-designed in a cartoon style, with some animation to make the game more lively. For example, when we get a combo with Dracula, we will see the prince of the night transform into a bat for a moment, while Frankenstein's skullcap lifts up.\n\nThe music is a mysterious tune that recreates the right tension during the gameplay.\n\nSlot features\nIn Horror Hotel, we find a square grid with 6 reels and 6 rows. We win by creating clusters of at least 5 identical symbols, up to more than 30. The basic bet is €0.10 per spin, and you can win up to a maximum of 20,000x the bet.\n\nSpecial features include the classic Autoplay and Turbo, which accelerates the fall of the symbols. The volatility is high, while the theoretical return to the player is 96.17%.\n\nHow to play Horror Hotel\nThe gameplay system of Horror Hotel is cascading, but a revised version. In fact, when we create groups of identical symbols, all the non-paying ones disappear, while the winning ones fall down and are replaced by a mysterious symbol. During the next Respin, the Mistery Symbol will take on the appearance of a paying symbol. If we obtain another win, we continue with this feature.\n\nLet's now move on to the symbols. The three potions of different colors are the symbols that pay the least. Then we find the mummy, the werewolf, Frankenstein, and Dracula.\n\nThe Wild symbol replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by a golden skull. When we get 3 special symbols in a single spin, we will get 5 free spins, which will take place inside the Hotel. The Mistery Symbol feature is also active during the Bonus game. With each Free Spin, we will see a Wild land, and each time a winning cluster occurs, we will see the multiplier increase by +1 to the left of the grid. Each Scatter that appears during the special feature gives an additional Free Spin.\n\nThis Bonus can also be purchased.\n\nFAQs\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nThe RTP value is a good 96.17%.\n\nI read that Horror Hotel uses a cluster system. What does that mean?\n\nIt means that to win, it is not necessary to create winning combos from left to right, but winning groups of symbols in any position, horizontally or vertically, as long as they are adjacent.\n\nCan I play on tablets and smartphones?\n\nYes, in addition to the PC, Horror Hotel is available for all mobile devices.\n        ",
