The style is that of comics, as evidenced by the font used to display information such as our winnings or the type of Bonus activated. \n\nThe background is a forest, with the grid framed in wood and the buttons, well positioned at the bottom, not taking up much space. The intentionally muted colors give the game a retro feel, accentuated by the music that accompanies our spins, reminiscent of an old 1950s film.\n\nExcellent RTP for high-level winnings\nThe game grid has five reels and four rows, with fixed paylines totaling 20. Book of Time bets start at a minimum of €0.10 but can be raised at will. The maximum win is 10,000 times the bet. \n\nIn addition to automatic spins, we also find two types of reel accelerators: Turbo and Super Turbo. The volatility is high, while the RTP is 96.13%.\n\nDifferent bonuses for fabulous winnings\nBefore diving into the various bonuses within this slot, let's take a look at the base game symbols. As in almost all games, we find playing cards good for a Royal Flush, from ten to ace, and symbols with a relatively low value. Following these are magic wands, witch hats, daggers, hands, and mice.\n\nThe book is a Wild/Scatter symbol, replacing all paying symbols. If it appears at least three times during the same spin, it awards 10 to 20 free spins.

The game grid has five reels and four rows, with 20 fixed paylines. Book of Time bets start at a minimum of €0.10 but can be increased at will. In addition to automatic spins, we also find two types of reel accelerators: Turbo and Super Turbo.

The maximum win is 10,000 times the bet amount.\nIn addition to automatic spins, we also find two types of reel accelerators: Turbo and Super Turbo.\nThe volatility is high, but the RTP is 96.13%.\n\nDifferent Bonuses for Fabulous Wins\nBefore we get into the various bonuses of this slot, let's take a look at the symbols of the base game. As in almost all games, here too we find playing cards good for a royal flush, from ten to ace, symbols that have a fairly low value. Following these, we find magic wands, witch hats, daggers, hands, and mice, each with its own symbol.\nThe book is a Wild/Scatter symbol, replacing all paying symbols, and if it appears at least three times during the same game, it awards from 10 to 20 free spins. Before the bonus game starts, a special symbol is selected that, if it lands on at least three reels, expands.\nThe clock is another Scatter symbol and awards ten free spins. On reels 2, 3, and 4, we will see clocks, whose hands change with each spin. Depending on the time shown, they will give us a multiplier. Moreover, each clock symbol that lands on the reels will cover the function of a Wild, expanding over the entire reel.\n            ",

Then there are those that leave a lasting impression on the memory due to their memorable characters, as is the case with Book of Time, the new slot game from Hawksaw Gaming featuring Canny the Can, the cheerful yellow can previously seen in two other online games.\nIn this case, the graphics immediately capture the player's attention, with our friendly companion located on the right-hand side of the grid controlling our plays. The style is that of comic books, as can be seen from the font used to write the words that inform us of the amount of our winnings or the type of bonus activated.\nThe background is a forest, with the grid framed in wood and the buttons, well arranged at the bottom, not taking up too much space. The colors are intentionally faded, giving the game a retro taste, a feature accentuated by the music that accompanies our plays, which seems to come from an old film from the fifties.\n\nA Great RTP for High-Level Winnings\nThe game grid has five reels and four rows, with 20 fixed paylines. Book of Time bets start at a minimum of €0.10 but can be increased at will. The maximum win is 10,000 times the bet amount.\nIn addition to automatic spins, we also find two types of reel accelerators: Turbo and Super Turbo.\nThe volatility is high, but the RTP is 96.13%.\n\nDifferent Bonuses for Fabulous Wins\nBefore we get into the various bonuses of this slot, let's take a look at the symbols of the base game.
