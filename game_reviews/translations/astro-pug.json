Il fascino delle sue strutture, dei suoi colori tipici e della sua cultura è immenso e sono molte le slot machines che provano a catturarlo, soprattutto concentrandosi su un’estetica che ricordi il celebre capodanno cinese. Lightning Box Games con il suo Astro Pug propone l’inaspettata combinazione tra Cina tradizionale e carlini.\nTradizione e carlini si incontrano in Astro Pug\nPartiamo analizzando l’aspetto grafico di Astro Pug. Lightning Box Games, come già accennato, propone una strana fusione tra tradizione cinese e carlini, razza che ha praticamente raggiunto un successo immenso grazie ad Internet. Il primo elemento, ovvero la tradizione, ci appare subito agli occhi grazie a due elementi: lo sfondo e la griglia. Sullo sfondo di Astro Pug troviamo un laghetto cinese con strutture tipiche dell’architettura cinese, le cui tettoie rosse sono presenti anche nella parte superiore della griglia. Quest’ultima è composta 4 rulli principali più due mini-rulli esterni. Come simboli normali troviamo quelli delle carte da gioco, mentre i simboli speciali continuano a rappresentare la tradizione cinese, e infatti sono composti da una scimmietta di giada, una carpa koi viola, un bambino, una sacca d’oro e un leoncino dorato, che potrebbe ricordare anche una tigre o l’effige di un carlino in tradizionale stile cinese. Il simbolo Wild è proprio l’anticipatissimo carlino, con indosso un abito tradizionale di colore blu, mentre il simbolo per il Bonus (di cui parleremo tra poco) sono due lanterne davanti ad una luna piena. Per quanto riguarda la musica della slot machine, Astro Plug ha delle sonorità che ricordano la tradizione cinese, che vengono però sostituite o coperte dagli allegri suoni di vittoria o dai normali effetti sonori.\nSpin gratuite su Astro Pug\nIl gameplay di Astro Pug è classico, ma con alcuni accorgimenti particolari. Con un RTP del 95.73%, quindi nella media, le grosse vincite della slot machine possono essere trovate più nelle spin gratuite e grazie ai moltiplicatori, ovvero le due caratteristiche peculiari del gameplay. Quando si ottengono 5 simboli Scatter nelle caselle più esterne dei rulli avrà inizio una serie illimitata di giri gratuiti, e nei rulli più esterni, a cominciare da sinistra, appariranno o un carlino o una bomba, il primo permetterà di continuare le spin gratuite, mentre la bomba metterà fine al tutto. Un’altra particolarità è che tutti i carlini rimarranno Wild durante tutto il bonus e se si ha fortuna si potrebbe sbloccare una Mega Spin in cui tutte le caselle della griglia Reelfecta diventeranno Wild. È presente anche un moltiplicatore della vincita, il cui simbolo è un ossicino dorato, il cui valore è segnato da un indicatore sotto il secondo rullo.\nAltre slot machines simili ad Astro Pug\nCome già accennato a inizio recensione, le slot machines a tema Cina sono innumerevoli, come Feng Fu, 88 Fortune Megaways e, se volete spostarvi sulle estetiche dei villaggi tradizionali cinesi, 100 Fortunes.

Lightning Box Games, with its Astro Pug, offers the unexpected combination of traditional China and pugs.\nTradition and pugs come together in Astro Pug\nLet's start by analyzing the graphic aspect of Astro Pug. Lightning Box Games, as already mentioned, offers a strange fusion of Chinese tradition and pugs, a breed that has practically achieved immense success thanks to the internet. The first element, namely tradition, immediately appears to our eyes thanks to two elements: the background and the grid. On the background of Astro Pug, we find a Chinese pond with typical Chinese architecture structures, the red roofs of which are also present in the upper part of the grid. The latter is composed of 4 main reels plus two mini-external ones. As normal symbols, we find those of playing cards, while the special symbols continue to represent Chinese tradition, and in fact, they are composed of a jade monkey, a purple koi carp, a child, a gold bag, and a golden pug, which could also remind of a tiger or the effigy of a pug in traditional Chinese style. The Wild symbol is the much-awaited pug himself, wearing a traditional blue outfit, while the symbol for the Bonus (which we will talk about in a moment) is two lanterns in front of a full moon. As for the music of the slot machine, Astro Plug has sounds that recall Chinese tradition, which are however replaced or covered by the cheerful sounds of victory or normal sound effects.\nFree spins on Astro Pug\nThe gameplay of Astro Pug is classic but with some particular tricks. With an RTP of 95.73%, therefore, average, the big wins of the slot machine can be found more in free spins and thanks to multipliers, which are the two peculiar features of gameplay. When you obtain 5 Scatter symbols in the outermost boxes of the reels a series of unlimited free spins will begin, and on the outermost reels, starting from the left, a pug or a bomb will appear, the first will allow spinning to continue for free, while the bomb will end it all. Another feature is that all pugs will remain Wild throughout the bonus and if you are lucky, you could unlock a Mega Spin where all the squares on the Reelfecta grid become Wild. There is also a win multiplier, whose symbol is a golden bone, whose value is marked by an indicator under the second reel.\nSimilar slot machines to Astro Pug\nAs already mentioned at the beginning of the review, Chinese themed slot machines are countless, such as Feng Fu, 88 Fortune Megaways and, if you want to move to the aesthetics of traditional Chinese villages, 100 Fortunes.

The charm of its structures, typical colors, and culture is immense, and there are many slot machines that try to capture it, especially by focusing on an aesthetic that recalls the famous Chinese New Year. Lightning Box Games, with its Astro Pug, offers the unexpected combination of traditional China and pugs.\nTradition and pugs come together in Astro Pug\nLet's start by analyzing the graphic aspect of Astro Pug. Lightning Box Games, as already mentioned, offers a strange fusion of Chinese tradition and pugs, a breed that has practically achieved immense success thanks to the internet. The first element, namely tradition, immediately appears to our eyes thanks to two elements: the background and the grid. On the background of Astro Pug, we find a Chinese pond with typical Chinese architecture structures, the red roofs of which are also present in the upper part of the grid. The latter is composed of 4 main reels plus two mini-external ones. As normal symbols, we find those of playing cards, while the special symbols continue to represent Chinese tradition, and in fact, they are composed of a jade monkey, a purple koi carp, a child, a gold bag, and a golden pug, which could also remind of a tiger or the effigy of a pug in traditional Chinese style. The Wild symbol is the much-awaited pug himself, wearing a traditional blue outfit, while the symbol for the Bonus (which we will talk about in a moment) is two lanterns in front of a full moon. As for the music of the slot machine, Astro Plug has sounds that recall Chinese tradition, which are however replaced or covered by the cheerful sounds of victory or normal sound effects.\nFree spins on Astro Pug\nThe gameplay of Astro Pug is classic but with some particular tricks. With an RTP of 95.73%, therefore, average, the big wins of the slot machine can be found more in free spins and thanks to multipliers, which are the two peculiar features of gameplay. When you obtain 5 Scatter symbols in the outermost boxes of the reels a series of unlimited free spins will begin, and on the outermost reels, starting from the left, a pug or a bomb will appear, the first will allow spinning to continue for free, while the bomb will end it all. Another feature is that all pugs will remain Wild throughout the bonus and if you are lucky, you could unlock a Mega Spin where all the squares on the Reelfecta grid become Wild. There is also a win multiplier, whose symbol is a golden bone, whose value is marked by an indicator under the second reel.\nSimilar slot machines to Astro Pug\nAs already mentioned at the beginning of the review, Chinese themed slot machines are countless, such as Feng Fu, 88 Fortune Megaways and, if you want to move to the aesthetics of traditional Chinese villages, 100 Fortunes. If, on the other hand, you are a cat lover, there could be Astro Cat, always from Lightning Box Games.\n            ",

The charm of its structures, typical colors, and culture is immense, and there are many slot machines that try to capture it, especially by focusing on an aesthetic that recalls the famous Chinese New Year. Lightning Box Games, with its Astro Pug, offers the unexpected combination of traditional China and pugs.\nTradition and pugs come together in Astro Pug\nLet's start by analyzing the graphic aspect of Astro Pug. Lightning Box Games, as already mentioned, offers a strange fusion of Chinese tradition and pugs, a breed that has practically achieved immense success thanks to the internet. The first element, namely tradition, immediately appears to our eyes thanks to two elements: the background and the grid. On the background of Astro Pug, we find a Chinese pond with typical Chinese architecture structures, the red roofs of which are also present in the upper part of the grid. The latter is composed of 4 main reels plus two mini-external ones. As normal symbols, we find those of playing cards, while the special symbols continue to represent Chinese tradition, and in fact, they are composed of a jade monkey, a purple koi carp, a child, a gold bag, and a golden pug, which could also remind of a tiger or the effigy of a pug in traditional Chinese style. The Wild symbol is the much-awaited pug himself, wearing a traditional blue outfit, while the symbol for the Bonus (which we will talk about in a moment) is two lanterns in front of a full moon. As for the music of the slot machine, Astro Plug has sounds that recall Chinese tradition, which are however replaced or covered by the cheerful sounds of victory or normal sound effects.\nFree spins on Astro Pug\nThe gameplay of Astro Pug is classic but with some particular tricks. With an RTP of 95.73%, therefore, average, the big wins of the slot machine can be found more in free spins and thanks to multipliers, which are the two peculiar features of gameplay. When you obtain 5 Scatter symbols in the outermost boxes of the reels a series of unlimited free spins will begin, and on the outermost reels, starting from the left, a pug or a bomb will appear, the first will allow spinning to continue for free, while the bomb will end it all. Another feature is that all pugs will remain Wild throughout the bonus and if you are lucky, you could unlock a Mega Spin where all the squares on the Reelfecta grid become Wild. There is also a win multiplier, whose symbol is a golden bone, whose value is marked by an indicator under the second reel.\nSimilar slot machines to Astro Pug\nAs already mentioned at the beginning of the review, Chinese themed slot machines are countless, such as Feng Fu, 88 Fortune Megaways and, if you want to move to the aesthetics of traditional Chinese villages, 100 Fortunes. If, on the other hand, you are a cat lover, there could be Astro Cat, always from Lightning Box Games.\n            ",

The charm of its structures, typical colors, and culture is immense, and there are many slot machines that try to capture it, especially by focusing on an aesthetic that recalls the famous Chinese New Year. Lightning Box Games, with its Astro Pug, offers the unexpected combination of traditional China and pugs.\nTradition and pugs come together in Astro Pug\nLet's start by analyzing the graphic aspect of Astro Pug. Lightning Box Games, as already mentioned, offers a strange fusion of Chinese tradition and pugs, a breed that has practically achieved immense success thanks to the internet. The first element, namely tradition, immediately appears to our eyes thanks to two elements: the background and the grid. On the background of Astro Pug, we find a Chinese pond with typical Chinese architecture structures, the red roofs of which are also present in the upper part of the grid. The latter is composed of 4 main reels plus two mini-external ones. As normal symbols, we find those of playing cards, while the special symbols continue to represent Chinese tradition, and in fact, they are composed of a jade monkey, a purple koi carp, a child, a gold bag, and a golden pug, which could also remind of a tiger or the effigy of a pug in traditional Chinese style. The Wild symbol is the much-awaited pug himself, wearing a traditional blue outfit, while the symbol for the Bonus (which we will talk about in a moment) is two lanterns in front of a full moon. As for the music of the slot machine, Astro Plug has sounds that recall Chinese tradition, which are however replaced or covered by the cheerful sounds of victory or normal sound effects.\nFree spins on Astro Pug\nThe gameplay of Astro Pug is classic but with some particular tricks. With an RTP of 95.73%, therefore, average, the big wins of the slot machine can be found more in free spins and thanks to multipliers, which are the two peculiar features of gameplay. When you obtain 5 Scatter symbols in the outermost boxes of the reels a series of unlimited free spins will begin, and on the outermost reels, starting from the left, a pug or a bomb will appear, the first will allow spinning to continue for free, while the bomb will end it all. Another feature is that all pugs will remain Wild throughout the bonus and if you are lucky, you could unlock a Mega Spin where all the squares on the Reelfecta grid become Wild. There is also a win multiplier, whose symbol is a golden bone, whose value is marked by an indicator under the second reel.\nSimilar slot machines to Astro Pug\nAs already mentioned at the beginning of the review, Chinese themed slot machines are countless, such as Feng Fu, 88 Fortune Megaways and, if you want to move to the aesthetics of traditional Chinese villages, 100 Fortunes. If, on the other hand, you are a cat lover, there could be Astro Cat, always from Lightning Box Games.\n            ",
