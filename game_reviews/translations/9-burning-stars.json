La griglia di piccole dimensioni e il numero esiguo di simboli ci ricorda le prime slot terrestri, quelle a manovella che si potevano trovare nei bar o nelle sale-giochi, mentre il gioco Bonus, ricco di moltiplicatori e simboli speciali, e il comparto grafico, ci riportano alla modernità.\nLa grafica è molto elaborata, con i rulli immersi nello spazio e una stella ardente sullo sfondo durante il gioco base, con costellazioni e nebulose quando invece ci spostiamo nel gioco bonus. Una musica coinvolgente ci accompagna durante il gioco, per un’esperienza immensa a ogni partita.\nGriglia piccola e volatilità variabile\nIn questo gioco la griglia è una 3×3, con una vincita massima pari a 1.500 volte la scommessa. Si parte con una scommessa di 0,10 €, che può essere aumentata a piacimento, e si vince quando sui rulli atterrano 5 simboli identici!\nTra le funzioni abbiamo la possibilità di selezionare i giri automatici e ben 3 livelli di velocità per velocizzare a piacimento la rotazione dei rulli.\nUn aspetto importante di questo gioco è la possibilità di decidere la volatilità attraverso il simbolo del peperoncino. Volatilità bassa, le vincite sono frequenti ma le somme non troppo alte; volatilità media, si ha un buon bilanciamento tra numero di giocate e importi guadagnati; volatilità alta, le vincite sono meno frequenti ma sempre di livello.\nOttimo anche il ritorno teorico al giocatore, che si attesta sul 96,12%.\nUn gioco Bonus galattico\nCome accennato sopra, in 9 Burning Stars ci sono pochi simboli: carte da gioco dal nove all’asso, la stella e il numero 7.\nCi sono poi dei gettoni con all’interno un moltiplicatore che si applica alle vincite di quello Spin. Quando sulla griglia compare il sole con all’interno un importo, questo viene trasferito nella replica in miniatura della griglia che si trova sulla destra. Quando sarà piena, verrà attivato il gioco Bonus Matrix.\nLa somma di tutti gli importi confluirà al centro della griglia regolare e partiranno 3 Respins. Abbiamo diverse tipologie di simboli:\n\nCash, con un importo variabile\nMistery, che può trasformarsi in qualsiasi simbolo\nMistery Jackpot che può trasformarsi in uno dei tre Jackpot a disposizione\n\nIn 9 Burning Stars c’è anche la funzione Gamble.\n\nFAQ: Le risposte alle domande più frequenti \nCosa è la funzione Gamble?\n\nCon la funzione Gamble si può tentare di raddoppiare la somma vinta.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGraphics and Sound Quality\n\nThe graphics of 9 Burning Stars are highly elaborate, with the reels immersed in space and a burning star background during the base game, and constellations and nebulas when we move into the bonus game. The engaging music accompanies us throughout the game, providing an immense experience with every spin.\n\nLevel of Volatility\n\nIn 9 Burning Stars, the grid is a 3x3, with a maximum win of 1,500 times the bet. The game offers three levels of volatility, low, medium, and high. Low volatility results in frequent wins but not too high amounts; medium volatility provides a good balance between the number of plays and the amounts earned, while high volatility means less frequent wins but always high-level ones. The theoretical return to player is also excellent, at 96.12%.\n\nBonus Game and Symbols\n\nIn 9 Burning Stars, there are only a few symbols, including playing cards from nine to ace, the star, and the number 7. Tokens with a multiplier inside can apply to the wins of that spin. When the sun with an amount inside appears on the grid, this is transferred to the miniature replica of the grid on the right, and the Bonus Matrix game is activated. The sum of all the amounts will converge to the center of the regular grid, and 3 Respins will start. Cash symbols with a variable amount, Mystery symbols which can turn into any symbol, and Mystery Jackpot symbols which can turn into one of the three available Jackpots are all available during the Bonus game.\n\nGamble Function\n\n9 Burning Stars also offers a Gamble function, where players can try to double the amount they won. By selecting the appropriate button, they will be asked to guess whether the color of the coin drawn will be green or blue. If the answer is correct, they double their winnings, but if they're wrong, they lose everything.\n\nAvailability and Certification\n\nWazan's slots, including 9 Burning Stars, are available in all the most famous online casinos. Players should check that the casino they want to play at has AAMS certification before playing.\n\n        \n            ",

The small grid and limited number of symbols remind us of the first mechanical slot machines that could be found in bars or gaming halls, but the Bonus game with its rich multipliers and special symbols and the graphics bring us back to the present day. \n\nThe graphics are highly elaborate, with the reels immersed in space and a burning star background during the base game, and constellations and nebulas when we move into the bonus game. The engaging music accompanies us throughout the game, providing an immense experience with every spin.\n\nSmall grid and variable volatility \n\nIn this game, the grid is a 3x3, with a maximum win of 1,500 times the bet. You start with a bet of €0.10, which can be increased as desired, and you win when 5 of the identical symbols land on the reels! \n\nAmong the features, we have the ability to select automatic spins and three levels of speed to speed up the rotation of the reels as desired. \n\nAn important aspect of this game is the ability to choose the volatility through the chili symbol. Low volatility results in frequent wins but not too high amounts; medium volatility provides a good balance between the number of plays and the amounts earned, while high volatility means less frequent wins but always high-level ones. \n\nThe theoretical return to player is also excellent, at 96.12%.\n\nA galactic Bonus game \n\nAs mentioned above, there are only a few symbols in 9 Burning Stars: playing cards from nine to ace, the star, and the number 7. \n\nThere are also tokens with a multiplier inside that applies to the wins of that spin. When the sun with an amount inside appears on the grid, this is transferred to the miniature replica of the grid on the right. When it is full, the Bonus Matrix game is activated. \n\nThe sum of all the amounts will converge to the center of the regular grid, and 3 Respins will start. We have different types of symbols:\n\nCash, with a variable amount\nMystery, which can turn into any symbol \nMystery Jackpot, which can turn into one of the three available Jackpots \n\n9 Burning Stars also offers the Gamble function. \n\nFAQ: Answers to frequently asked questions \n\nWhat is the Gamble function?\n\nWith the Gamble function, you can try to double the amount you won. By clicking on the appropriate button, you will be asked to guess whether the color of the coin drawn will be green or blue. If the answer is right, you double your winnings, but if you're wrong, you lose everything.\n\nWhere can I play 9 Burning Stars?\n\nWe can find Wazan's slots in all the most famous online casinos, remembering to check that they have AAMS certification!\n\nI read that there is the possibility to choose the type of variability. What changes?\n\nChoosing one type of variability rather than another allows you to decide whether to risk winning little but significant amounts or win often but never dizzying sums. Basically, it depends on what type of gambler you are!\n        ",
