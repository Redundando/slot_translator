The game grid is located on the deck of the ship as it sails the Caribbean Sea, while during the Bonus game we move to the deserted island where the treasure is hidden. The buttons that allow us to start the game are positioned on the right, with the bottom part instead dedicated to the bet selector, balance and win count.\nEach Spin is accompanied by music typical of pirate movies, essential for raising adrenaline and giving us a dream gaming experience!\nAn infinity of ways to win!\nISoftBet decided to focus on a traditional grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows on which the 10 fixed paylines are placed. To win, it is necessary to create combos of identical symbols starting from the right reel and proceeding to the left. The cost of each game is quite low, with the minimum bet starting at € 0.10. With the Autoplay function, however, we can set from 5 to 100 automatic spins that can be interrupted at any time.\nThe volatility is high, while the RTP value is estimated at 96%.\nA versatile Wild\nBefore seeing the special feature of this slot, let's take a look at the symbols we will need to form our paying combinations.\nThe doubloons with the poker card suits are the symbols of lower value, followed by the telescope, the parrot, the helm and finally the treasure.\nThe captain symbol covers the function of Wild and Scatter. This is an expanding symbol, which means that when it lands it extends across the entire reel. In addition to replacing all symbols, when at least three appear, we are rewarded with Free Spins. The free spins start with a x2 multiplier on the reels where the Wilds landed. Additional captain symbols during the bonus increase the value of the multipliers. This function can also be purchased through the appropriate button.\n\nFAQs\nWhat is the theoretical return to player value?\nIn Captain’s Quest Treasure Island, the RTP value is 96%.\n\nAre there Wilds and Scatters?\nYes, even if there are not two different symbols, as both are connected to the captain symbol.\n\nCan I vary the paylines?\nNo, in Captain’s Quest Treasure Island the lines are ten and fixed.\n            ",
