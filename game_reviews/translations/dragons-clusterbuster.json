Dragons Clusterbuster is no exception. As the title suggests, the slot game revolves around majestic mythological creatures, the Dragons, with wings and the ability to breathe fire.\nThe game's main colors are gold, silver, and copper, with blue and green in a minor tone. At the sides of the reel, there's the Dragon's scaly skin, which is the game's only reference to the theme.\nAt the top, there are three rounds with a lock in the center of the reel, and in the middle, there's an egg that will play one of the primary functions in the game.\nCluster Mechanism\nThe game mechanic in this slot is a cluster mechanism; every time a cluster of at least five adjacent identical symbols lands, it results in a winning combination. The system is cascading, so the winning symbols disappear and are replaced by new symbols that can generate new payouts. Therefore, every spin has 72 symbols landing. The game grid is square, with nine reels and nine rows. The minimum bet is 0.20€, but it may be increased at will. The primary functions are Autoplay and Turbo, which accelerate the fall of the symbols.\nThe game has a high volatility, so you don't win often, but the payouts are substantial.\nThe Dragon's Eye\nOther than the playing cards, the symbols that pay out the least, there are scrolls, swords, cross spheres, and crowns. The Wild symbol can replace all other symbols and can land in any position on the reel.\nIn the middle of the reel, there is a 3x3 square with an egg inside. Every time the symbols around the egg are removed with a single spin, the edges light up. By removing all eight symbols around the egg, an eye will appear in the egg, and you'll unlock the corresponding function. The first is the blue eye. In this case, low-value symbols are removed, generating a cascading effect that can produce larger payouts.\nRemoving the next eight tiles in the middle unlocks the second function. The Dragon's Eye is now green, randomly displaying numerous Wilds that replace different base symbols.\nThe third function is related to the purple eye. In this case, lightning bolts will strike a random number of symbols, transforming them into multipliers.\nThe final function is the Free Spins. By unlocking eight tiles around the egg, you'll receive ten free spins as a gift.\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat does cascade system mean?\n\nIt means that every time you obtain a winning combination, the payout symbols will be removed and replaced by new ones, generating further combos.\n\n\nWhat's the theoretical return to player (RTP) of Dragons Clusterbuster?\n\nThe RTP is 96%, which is the average for most slot games!\n\n\nCan I play Dragons Clusterbuster on my smartphone?\n\nCertainly, Dragons Clusterbuster is available on any device!",

It is safe to say that Dragons Clusterbuster does not disappoint. As the title suggests, the theme of the slot game is dragons - mythical creatures with wings and the ability to breathe fire.\nThe main colors of the game are gold, silver, and copper, along with green and blue. The dragon's scaly skin is visible on the sides of the grid, which is the only reference to the game's theme.\nThree round shapes with a lock on the top, and an egg is located in the center, which plays a significant function in the game.\nCluster Mechanism\nIn this slot game, the cluster mechanism is used: whenever a cluster of at least five identical adjacent symbols lands, a winning combination is obtained. The system works by cascading; thus, winning symbols disappear, and they are replaced by completely new ones that can generate new winning combinations. Subsequently, 72 symbols land on each turn. The game grid is square in shape, with nine reels and nine rows. The minimum bet is €0.20, but it can be increased at any time. The Autoplay and Turbo are among the essential functions, allowing the players to speed up the falling of symbols.\nThe volatility is high, so you may not win often, but the rewards are substantial.\nThe Dragon's Eye\nApart from the playing cards, which are the symbols that pay the least, we also find the scroll, swords, the sphere with the cross, and the crown. The Wild symbol replaces all symbols and can appear anywhere on the grid.\nIn the center of the grid, there is a 3×3 square with an egg inside. Whenever the symbols around the egg are removed in a single spin, the outlines light up. By removing all eight symbols, an eye appears in the egg, and the corresponding function is unlocked. The first one is the blue eye. In this case, the low-value symbols are removed, generating a cascading effect that can produce higher winnings.\nRemoving the next eight tiles in the center unlocks the second function. The Dragon's Eye is now green, and we will randomly see numerous Wilds replacing various base symbols.\nThe third function is linked to the purple eye. In this case, lightning will strike a random number of symbols, transforming them into multipliers.\nThe last function is Free Spins. By unlocking eight tiles around the egg, ten free spins will be awarded.\n\nFAQs\nWhat does the cascading system mean?\nIt means that whenever we get a winning combination, the paying symbols are removed, and they are replaced by other new ones that can generate further combos.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player of Dragons Clusterbuster?\nThe RTP value is 96%, which is the average for most slot games!\n\nCan I play Dragons Clusterbuster on my smartphone?\nOf course! Dragons Clusterbuster is available for every device!\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics\n\nDragons Clusterbuster uses a cluster mechanism to generate winning combinations. The game grid is 9x9, and at least five identical adjacent symbols generate a cluster. The system works by cascading; thus, winning combinations disappear, and the cascading effect can lead to new wins. The game features Autoplay and Turbo functions to speed up gameplay. The game has high volatility, so wins may not be frequent, but when they occur, they are substantial.\n\nVisual Design\n\nThe game's theme is centered around dragons, with the main colors being gold, silver, and copper, green, and blue. Aside from the dragon's scaly skin visible on the game grid's sides, there is no direct reference to the game's theme. The game's graphics are highly detailed, as we would expect from a Red Tiger slot game.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nDragons Clusterbuster has a central 3x3 square on the game grid, where eggs with corresponding eyes are located. Each eye has a unique function that can be unlocked by removing the surrounding symbols around the egg. The blue eye removes low-value symbols, creating a cascading effect that can generate higher wins. The green eye randomly replaces different base symbols with Wilds. The purple eye randomly strikes a number of symbols with lightning, turning them into multipliers. The last function is Free Spins, where eight tiles around the egg are removed, and ten free spins are awarded.\n\nVolatility\n\nDragons Clusterbuster has high volatility, meaning wins may not happen often, but when they do, they are substantial.

The system uses cascading, meaning that winning symbols disappear, and new ones come in to generate new winning combinations. The game grid is square in shape, with nine reels and nine rows, and there are 72 symbols available on each turn. The minimum bet possible is €0.20, but this can be increased at any time. The Autoplay and Turbo features are also available, allowing for faster gameplay.\n\nVisuals and Aesthetics\n\nDragons Clusterbuster has impressive graphics with colors like gold, silver, and copper mixed with blue and green. Although the game is about dragons, their appearance is only visible on the sides of the grid. The playing card symbols are the ones that pay the least, while others like the scroll, swords, and sphere with the crown pay more. The grid also includes a 3x3 square with an egg in the center, which lights up when adjacent symbols are removed to unlock one of four functions.\n\nBonus Features\n\nApart from the Wild symbol that replaces all other symbols, the game's central 3x3 square has an egg that unlocks four bonus functions when surrounded by removed tiles. The first, called the blue eye, removes low-value symbols, producing higher winnings. The second function, the green eye, sees numerous Wilds appearing to replace various base symbols at random. The third function, the purple eye, sees random symbols being hit by lightning to transform into multipliers. The fourth unlocks ten free spins when the eight tiles around the egg are all removed.\n\nVolatility\n\nThe game's volatility is high, so players may not win every time, but the rewards are significant.\n\nCompatibility\n\nDragons Clusterbuster is accessible on all devices, including smartphones.\n\n        \n            ",

It is safe to say that Dragons Clusterbuster does not disappoint. As the title suggests, the theme of the slot game is dragons - mythical creatures with wings and the ability to breathe fire.\nThe main colors of the game are gold, silver, and copper, along with green and blue. The dragon's scaly skin is visible on the sides of the grid, which is the only reference to the game's theme.\nThree round shapes with a lock on the top, and an egg is located in the center, which plays a significant function in the game.\nCluster Mechanism\nIn this slot game, the cluster mechanism is used: whenever a cluster of at least five identical adjacent symbols lands, a winning combination is obtained. The system works by cascading; thus, winning symbols disappear, and they are replaced by completely new ones that can generate new winning combinations. Subsequently, 72 symbols land on each turn. The game grid is square in shape, with nine reels and nine rows. The minimum bet is €0.20, but it can be increased at any time. The Autoplay and Turbo are among the essential functions, allowing the players to speed up the falling of symbols.\nThe volatility is high, so you may not win often, but the rewards are substantial.\nThe Dragon's Eye\nApart from the playing cards, which are the symbols that pay the least, we also find the scroll, swords, the sphere with the cross, and the crown. The Wild symbol replaces all symbols and can appear anywhere on the grid.\nIn the center of the grid, there is a 3×3 square with an egg inside. Whenever the symbols around the egg are removed in a single spin, the outlines light up. By removing all eight symbols, an eye appears in the egg, and the corresponding function is unlocked. The first one is the blue eye. In this case, the low-value symbols are removed, generating a cascading effect that can produce higher winnings.\nRemoving the next eight tiles in the center unlocks the second function. The Dragon's Eye is now green, and we will randomly see numerous Wilds replacing various base symbols.\nThe third function is linked to the purple eye. In this case, lightning will strike a random number of symbols, transforming them into multipliers.\nThe last function is Free Spins. By unlocking eight tiles around the egg, ten free spins will be awarded.\n\nFAQs\nWhat does the cascading system mean?\nIt means that whenever we get a winning combination, the paying symbols are removed, and they are replaced by other new ones that can generate further combos.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player of Dragons Clusterbuster?\nThe RTP value is 96%, which is the average for most slot games!\n\nCan I play Dragons Clusterbuster on my smartphone?\nOf course! Dragons Clusterbuster is available for every device!\n        ",
