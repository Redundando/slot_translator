I 5 rulli attraverso i quali gocheremo si trovano in uno dei classici vicoli bui e stretti di Londra, dal quale il giocatore può riconoscere i più importanti edifici caratteristici della città.

Il primo ha la funzione di “Wild”, che consente quindi di sostituire ogni simbolo necessario alla vincita, come un jolly, ma anche di raddoppiare la vincita stessa. Questo simbolo però non può sostituire il Big Ben, che rappresenta infatti il simbolo “Scatter”. Quest’ultimo è fondamentale per la giocabilità, poiché, quando compare nei rulli 2, 3, 4, o 5 permette di moltiplicare la puntata da 2 fino a 1000 volte! Per non parlare del fatto che può portare ad ottenere fino a 20 giri gratuiti, prolungando la vincita durante il corso del gioco.\nCome se non bastasse, altre funzioni importanti sono l’Autoplay e il Gamble, che completano l’esperienza di gioco, rendendola più immersiva e accattivante.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nSe il tema londinese è quello che vi appassiona di più, vi consigliamo anche Fowl Play London, una slot machine sviluppata da WMG e basata sul misterioso personaggio di Sherlock Holmes.\n",

However, Aristocrat's strength lies in its ability to create suggestive atmospheres that allow players to fully immerse themselves in the game. In this article, we will discuss Big Ben, a slot machine produced by Aristocrat that will transport you to the famous clock tower, a symbol of London and England.\n\nIn the next paragraph, we will examine in detail how the game's creator developed the atmosphere and how it relates to the slot's features, creating a pleasant and interactive gaming experience.\n\nA Suggestive Graphic\nThe game immediately plunges you into a London atmosphere through colorful and highly detailed graphics. The game begins with some of the characteristic symbols of the British theme: a royal guard, Big Ben, and some characteristic buildings of Piccadilly Circus, not to mention the presence of various scenes from the character of Sherlock Holmes in the game. The 5 reels we'll play through can be found in one of London's classic dark and narrow alleys, from which the player can recognize the city's most important characteristic buildings. The auditory experience of the game is also very interesting, used to best complete the atmosphere and give a better idea of the landscape in which one finds oneself. Each click of the button will sound like the bell of the clock tower, not to mention the fantastic soundtrack of the game that will make every game on the Big Ben slot a pleasant one.\n\nBut let's analyze the fundamental part of the game, namely the features and symbols.

However, Aristocrat's strength lies in its ability to create suggestive atmospheres that allow players to fully immerse themselves in the game. In this article, we will discuss Big Ben, a slot machine produced by Aristocrat that will transport you to the famous clock tower, a symbol of London and England.\n\nIn the next paragraph, we will examine in detail how the game's creator developed the atmosphere and how it relates to the slot's features, creating a pleasant and interactive gaming experience.\n\nA Suggestive Graphic\nThe game immediately plunges you into a London atmosphere through colorful and highly detailed graphics. The game begins with some of the characteristic symbols of the British theme: a royal guard, Big Ben, and some characteristic buildings of Piccadilly Circus, not to mention the presence of various scenes from the character of Sherlock Holmes in the game. The 5 reels we'll play through can be found in one of London's classic dark and narrow alleys, from which the player can recognize the city's most important characteristic buildings. The auditory experience of the game is also very interesting, used to best complete the atmosphere and give a better idea of the landscape in which one finds oneself. Each click of the button will sound like the bell of the clock tower, not to mention the fantastic soundtrack of the game that will make every game on the Big Ben slot a pleasant one.\n\nBut let's analyze the fundamental part of the game, namely the features and symbols. Besides having a magnificent graphic design, Big Ben slot boasts exceptional gameplay.\n\nFunctions and Symbols\nA characteristic place like London is rich in symbolism and typical elements. Aristocrat has managed to exploit this feature of the city, making the most of its most important elements. The symbols inside the slot are in fact made up of the queen's crown, the metal street lamp, the red telephone booth, the Double Decker, a characteristic red double-decker bus, and many others, including the typical playing card symbols of J, Q, K and A.\n\nAmong these, the most important symbols are certainly the royal guard and Big Ben. The first serves as a \"Wild,\" allowing it to replace any necessary symbol for winning, like a wild card, but also doubling the winnings. However, this symbol cannot replace Big Ben, which is the \"Scatter\" symbol. The latter is crucial for gameplay because when it appears on reels 2, 3, 4, or 5, it can multiply the bet from 2 up to 1000 times! Not to mention that it can lead to up to 20 free spins that prolong the winnings during the course of the game.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, other important features are Autoplay and Gamble, which complete the gaming experience, making it more immersive and captivating.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf the London theme is your favorite, we also recommend Fowl Play London, a slot machine developed by WMG based on the mysterious character of Sherlock Holmes, for a truly atmospheric experience.\n            ",

However, Aristocrat's strength lies in its ability to create suggestive atmospheres that allow players to fully immerse themselves in the game. In this article, we will discuss Big Ben, a slot machine produced by Aristocrat that will transport you to the famous clock tower, a symbol of London and England.\n\nIn the next paragraph, we will examine in detail how the game's creator developed the atmosphere and how it relates to the slot's features, creating a pleasant and interactive gaming experience.\n\nA Suggestive Graphic\nThe game immediately plunges you into a London atmosphere through colorful and highly detailed graphics. The game begins with some of the characteristic symbols of the British theme: a royal guard, Big Ben, and some characteristic buildings of Piccadilly Circus, not to mention the presence of various scenes from the character of Sherlock Holmes in the game. The 5 reels we'll play through can be found in one of London's classic dark and narrow alleys, from which the player can recognize the city's most important characteristic buildings. The auditory experience of the game is also very interesting, used to best complete the atmosphere and give a better idea of the landscape in which one finds oneself. Each click of the button will sound like the bell of the clock tower, not to mention the fantastic soundtrack of the game that will make every game on the Big Ben slot a pleasant one.\n\nBut let's analyze the fundamental part of the game, namely the features and symbols. Besides having a magnificent graphic design, Big Ben slot boasts exceptional gameplay.\n\nFunctions and Symbols\nA characteristic place like London is rich in symbolism and typical elements. Aristocrat has managed to exploit this feature of the city, making the most of its most important elements. The symbols inside the slot are in fact made up of the queen's crown, the metal street lamp, the red telephone booth, the Double Decker, a characteristic red double-decker bus, and many others, including the typical playing card symbols of J, Q, K and A.\n\nAmong these, the most important symbols are certainly the royal guard and Big Ben. The first serves as a \"Wild,\" allowing it to replace any necessary symbol for winning, like a wild card, but also doubling the winnings. However, this symbol cannot replace Big Ben, which is the \"Scatter\" symbol. The latter is crucial for gameplay because when it appears on reels 2, 3, 4, or 5, it can multiply the bet from 2 up to 1000 times! Not to mention that it can lead to up to 20 free spins that prolong the winnings during the course of the game.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, other important features are Autoplay and Gamble, which complete the gaming experience, making it more immersive and captivating.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf the London theme is your favorite, we also recommend Fowl Play London, a slot machine developed by WMG based on the mysterious character of Sherlock Holmes, for a truly atmospheric experience.\n            ",
