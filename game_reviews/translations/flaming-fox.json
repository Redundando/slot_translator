    "original_text": "\nFlaming Fox\nCerto che la Red Tiger con questa slot ha davvero superato le nostre più rosee aspettative, creando una slot impeccabile dal punto di vista grafico e con tanti accorgimenti che faranno felici i giocatori più esigenti. tema di Flaming Fox è un tempio cinese in cui vive una saggia volpe – guerriero alle prese con le tecniche di meditazione. Per ricreare la giusta ambientazione, si è puntato molto sul comparto grafico, che appare studiato nei minimi dettagli. Una musica orientaleggiante accompagna la rotazione dei rulli, con la griglia di gioco sistemata all’interno del tempio. Sullo sfondo si trova la volpe di fuoco ninja, anche se non possiamo vederla in modo dettagliato perché nascosta nell’ombra. Nella parte bassa della griglia troviamo pochi tasti, quello automatico e quello turbo, oltre naturalmente allo Start. Oltre ad essi, c’è la casellina da cui impostare la nostra scommessa.\nCaratteristiche di Flaming Fox\nPer questa slot si è scelto di puntare su una griglia tradizionale, con 5 rulli e 3 righe. Le linee di pagamento sono 10, fisse, e la puntata minima per linea è di appena 0,02 € per un totale di 0,20 €. La scommessa massima totale è invece di 20 €, una cifra non troppo esagerata. Particolarità che ci ha davvero colpito è il fatto che le combinazioni vincenti possono verificarsi anche da destra a sinistra e non solo da sinistra a destra come avviene di solito. Flaming Fox ha una volatilità alta e un RTP del 96,11%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nSi vince abbinando almeno 3 simboli in successione su una linea di pagamento. Tra i simboli che pagano meno troviamo naturalmente le carte da gioco dal dieci all’asso, seguiti dagli stivali a forma di zampe di volpe e la maschera. Con la fascia con la placca argentata i pagamenti cominciano a farsi consistenti, anche se a pagare di più sono la pergamena infuocata e le spade del ninja circondate dalle fiamme. Anche il simbolo Wild, ossia la scritta Jolly davanti a due code di volpe incrociate, è pagante, oltre a sostituire tutti i simboli regolari. Il bello di questa slot però sta tutto nel sistema di Bonus che la Red Tiger ha escogitato. In modo del tutto casuale, la volpe ninja lascia la sua postazione nell’ombra e salta sui rulli. Nella prima funzione speciale la volpe di Fuoco si esibirà in alcune tecniche di combattimento infuocate che spazzeranno via i rulli regolari scoprendo un secondo set di rulli con Jolly e simboli di alto valore. Nella seconda funzione la volpe può colpire i simboli e trasformarli in Jolly che rimarranno fissi durante lo spin. Quando invece compariranno sui rulli 3 simboli giri gratis in qualsiasi posizione, allora verremo ricompensati con un numero casuale di Free Spins, durante i quali potremmo ottenere ulteriori giri extra!\n",

            "response": "Flaming Fox Slot Review\nRed Tiger has truly surpassed our highest expectations with this slot, creating impeccable graphics and numerous features that will satisfy even the most demanding players. The theme of Flaming Fox is a Chinese temple where a wise fox warrior engages in meditation techniques. To recreate the perfect atmosphere, great attention has been paid to the graphics, which are detailed in every aspect. The rotating reels are accompanied by oriental music, with the game board placed inside the temple. In the background, we find the ninja fox, although we cannot see it in detail because it is hidden in the shadows. At the bottom of the board, we find a few buttons, including the automatic and turbo buttons, as well as the Start button. In addition, there is the box where we can set our bet.\n\nFeatures of Flaming Fox\nFor this slot, a traditional board with 5 reels and 3 rows has been chosen. There are 10 paylines that are fixed, and the minimum bet per line is just €0.02, for a total of €0.20. The maximum total bet is €20, which is not too excessive. One particularity that really struck us is that winning combinations can occur from right to left as well as from left to right, which is not common. Flaming Fox has high volatility and an RTP of 96.11%.\n\nSymbols and Features\nTo win, you must match at least 3 symbols in a row on a payline. Among the lower-paying symbols, we find the playing cards from ten to ace, followed by fox paw-shaped boots and a mask. With the silver-plated band, the payouts start to become substantial, although the highest paying symbols are the fiery parchment and the ninja swords surrounded by flames. The Wild symbol, which is the word \"Jolly\" in front of two crossed fox tails, is also paying, in addition to replacing all regular symbols. However, the beauty of this slot lies in the Bonus system that Red Tiger has devised. The ninja fox randomly leaves its hiding place in the shadows and jumps onto the reels. In the first special feature, the flaming fox will perform some fiery combat techniques that will sweep away the regular reels, revealing a second set of reels with Wilds and high-value symbols. In the second feature, the fox can hit symbols and turn them into fixed Wilds during the spin. When 3 free spins symbols appear on the reels in any position, we will be rewarded with a random number of Free Spins, during which we may get additional extra spins!",

The theme of Flaming Fox is a Chinese temple where a wise fox warrior engages in meditation techniques. To recreate the perfect atmosphere, great attention has been paid to the graphics, which are detailed in every aspect. The rotating reels are accompanied by oriental music, with the game board placed inside the temple. In the background, we find the ninja fox, although we cannot see it in detail because it is hidden in the shadows. At the bottom of the board, we find a few buttons, including the automatic and turbo buttons, as well as the Start button. In addition, there is the box where we can set our bet.\n\nFeatures of Flaming Fox\nFor this slot, a traditional board with 5 reels and 3 rows has been chosen. There are 10 paylines that are fixed, and the minimum bet per line is just €0.02, for a total of €0.20. The maximum total bet is €20, which is not too excessive. One particularity that really struck us is that winning combinations can occur from right to left as well as from left to right, which is not common. Flaming Fox has high volatility and an RTP of 96.11%.\n\nSymbols and Features\nTo win, you must match at least 3 symbols in a row on a payline. Among the lower-paying symbols, we find the playing cards from ten to ace, followed by fox paw-shaped boots and a mask. With the silver-plated band, the payouts start to become substantial, although the highest paying symbols are the fiery parchment and the ninja swords surrounded by flames. The Wild symbol, which is the word \"Jolly\" in front of two crossed fox tails, is also paying, in addition to replacing all regular symbols. However, the beauty of this slot lies in the Bonus system that Red Tiger has devised. The ninja fox randomly leaves its hiding place in the shadows and jumps onto the reels. In the first special feature, the flaming fox will perform some fiery combat techniques that will sweep away the regular reels, revealing a second set of reels with Wilds and high-value symbols. In the second feature, the fox can hit symbols and turn them into fixed Wilds during the spin. When 3 free spins symbols appear on the reels in any position, we will be rewarded with a random number of Free Spins, during which we may get additional extra spins!\n            ",

The graphics are incredibly detailed and create the perfect atmosphere. The game board is located inside the temple and the rotating reels are accompanied by authentic oriental music. In the background, the ninja fox can be seen hidden in the shadows. The attention to detail is impeccable, making the game visually stunning.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nFlaming Fox has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 10 fixed paylines. The minimum bet per line is €0.02, and the maximum total bet is €20. Winning combinations can occur from left to right and right to left. The game has high volatility and an RTP of 96.11%. What sets Flaming Fox apart from other slots is the Bonus system, where the ninja fox randomly appears and triggers special features. During the first feature, fiery combat techniques are used to reveal a second set of reels with Wilds and high-value symbols. During the second feature, symbols are turned into fixed Wilds. Getting three free spins symbols in any position will trigger a random number of Free Spins, during which extra spins can be won.\n\nBet Limits and Paylines\n\nThe minimum bet per line in Flaming Fox is €0.02, with 10 fixed paylines. The maximum total bet is €20, making it a great option for both low and high rollers. Winning combinations can occur from left to right and right to left, which is an uncommon feature in slot games.\n\nSymbols and Wilds\n\nThe symbols in Flaming Fox range from playing cards to fox paw-shaped boots and a mask. There are also silver-plated bands, fiery parchments, and ninja swords surrounded by flames. The highest paying symbol is the ninja sword, followed by the fiery parchment. The Wild symbol is the word 'Jolly' in front of two crossed fox tails, which replaces all regular symbols. The ninja fox also appears randomly and triggers special features that can reveal a second set of reels with Wilds and high-value symbols, turn symbols into fixed Wilds, or award Free Spins.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nFlaming Fox has high volatility, which means that wins may be less frequent but higher in value. The game has an RTP of 96.11%, which is slightly above average for online slot games. While there is no guarantee of winning, the high volatility and RTP make Flaming Fox worth a try for players looking for a thrilling slot experience.\n\n        \n            ",

The theme of Flaming Fox is a Chinese temple where a wise fox warrior engages in meditation techniques. To recreate the perfect atmosphere, great attention has been paid to the graphics, which are detailed in every aspect. The rotating reels are accompanied by oriental music, with the game board placed inside the temple. In the background, we find the ninja fox, although we cannot see it in detail because it is hidden in the shadows. At the bottom of the board, we find a few buttons, including the automatic and turbo buttons, as well as the Start button. In addition, there is the box where we can set our bet.\n\nFeatures of Flaming Fox\nFor this slot, a traditional board with 5 reels and 3 rows has been chosen. There are 10 paylines that are fixed, and the minimum bet per line is just €0.02, for a total of €0.20. The maximum total bet is €20, which is not too excessive. One particularity that really struck us is that winning combinations can occur from right to left as well as from left to right, which is not common. Flaming Fox has high volatility and an RTP of 96.11%.\n\nSymbols and Features\nTo win, you must match at least 3 symbols in a row on a payline. Among the lower-paying symbols, we find the playing cards from ten to ace, followed by fox paw-shaped boots and a mask. With the silver-plated band, the payouts start to become substantial, although the highest paying symbols are the fiery parchment and the ninja swords surrounded by flames. The Wild symbol, which is the word \"Jolly\" in front of two crossed fox tails, is also paying, in addition to replacing all regular symbols. However, the beauty of this slot lies in the Bonus system that Red Tiger has devised. The ninja fox randomly leaves its hiding place in the shadows and jumps onto the reels. In the first special feature, the flaming fox will perform some fiery combat techniques that will sweep away the regular reels, revealing a second set of reels with Wilds and high-value symbols. In the second feature, the fox can hit symbols and turn them into fixed Wilds during the spin. When 3 free spins symbols appear on the reels in any position, we will be rewarded with a random number of Free Spins, during which we may get additional extra spins!\n            ",

In addition, there is the box where we can set our bet.\n\nFeatures of Flaming Fox\nFor this slot, a traditional board with 5 reels and 3 rows has been chosen. There are 10 paylines that are fixed, and the minimum bet per line is just €0.02, for a total of €0.20. The maximum total bet is €20, which is not too excessive. One particularity that really struck us is that winning combinations can occur from right to left as well as from left to right, which is not common. Flaming Fox has high volatility and an RTP of 96.11%.\n\nSymbols and Features\nTo win, you must match at least 3 symbols in a row on a payline. Among the lower-paying symbols, we find the playing cards from ten to ace, followed by fox paw-shaped boots and a mask. With the silver-plated band, the payouts start to become substantial, although the highest paying symbols are the fiery parchment and the ninja swords surrounded by flames. The Wild symbol, which is the word \"Jolly\" in front of two crossed fox tails, is also paying, in addition to replacing all regular symbols. However, the beauty of this slot lies in the Bonus system that Red Tiger has devised. The ninja fox randomly leaves its hiding place in the shadows and jumps onto the reels. In the first special feature, the flaming fox will perform some fiery combat techniques that will sweep away the regular reels, revealing a second set of reels with Wilds and high-value symbols. In the second feature, the fox can hit symbols and turn them into fixed Wilds during the spin. When 3 free spins symbols appear on the reels in any position, we will be rewarded with a random number of Free Spins, during which we may get additional extra spins!\n            ",

The theme of Flaming Fox is a Chinese temple where a wise fox warrior engages in meditation techniques. To recreate the perfect atmosphere, great attention has been paid to the graphics, which are detailed in every aspect. The rotating reels are accompanied by oriental music, with the game board placed inside the temple.
