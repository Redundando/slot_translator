A voler essere precisi potremmo essere in Germania o in Belgio, a giudicare dai lineamenti del minatore che sorveglia la griglia: capelli e barba rossi, occhi azzurri e un boccale di birra bavarese tra le mani.\nLa grafica è molto ben fatta, la griglia è incastrata in un’impalcatura di legno e ferro e sullo sfondo si notano pietre preziose colorate. In generale ogni elemento è scolpito nella pietra, i tasti Start, Autoplay etc., ma anche le lettere delle carte da gioco.\nLa musica che accompagna le giocate ha un buon ritmo incalzante che piacerà a chi gradisce un sottofondo sonoro dinamico, ma in caso contrario è possibile silenziare il gioco dal menù.\nCaratteristiche di Dynamite Frenzy\nla Light & Wonder ha optato per una griglia semplice con 5 rulli e 3 righe. Su ognuna delle 10 linee di pagamento fisse è possibile scommettere un minimo di 0,01 €, con il singolo Spin che verrà a costare appena 0,10 €.\nCon L’Autoplay si possono impostare da 5 a 100 giri automatici, ma è necessario inserire anche un limite di perdita che una volta superato bloccherà la funzione. Il cursore con il fulmine è invece il Turbo e serve per accelerare la rotazione dei simboli.\nLa volatilità è media, mentre il ritorno teorico al giocatore (RTP) corrisponde al 95,95%.\nCome si vince a Dynamite Frenzy\nPer poter vincere a Dynamite Frenzy è necessario creare una serie di almeno tre simboli identici partendo dal primo rullo di sinistra e procedendo verso destra. Per quel che riguarda sul valore dei simboli, diciamo che le carte da gioco hanno un basso valore, mentre il piccone, la lanterna, il boccale di birra, la mappa e il casco ripagano con somme più interessanti. Per avere chiaro a quanto ammontino le ricompense, vi rimandiamo alla tabella Payments accedendo dal menù.\nAbbiamo poi tre simboli Cash rappresentati da tre pepite accompagnate da un moltiplicatore: oro, argento e bronzo. Per vincere non è necessario che le pepite nella combo siano tutte dello stesso tipo; quindi, basta che ad esempio ce ne siano due dorate e una argento.\nLa mattonella dorata è il Wild, sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto quelli speciali e se ne atterrano 5 durante lo stesso Spin ricompensano con una vincita pari a quella del simbolo di valore più alto.\nIl bidone è il nostro simbolo Scatter e ne servono 3, 4 o 5 per ottenere 6, 8 o 10 Free Spins.\nDurante il gioco base e il gioco Bonus, si può attivare casualmente la funzione DWARF, introdotta dal minatore con in mano un diamante.

Players can place bets as low as €0.01 per line, with each spin costing only €0.10. The playing cards have a lower value while the pickaxe, lantern, beer mug, map, and helmet symbols have higher values. Three Cash symbols, represented by gold, silver, and bronze nuggets, each with its own multiplier, can be matched in any combination to win payouts. The golden tile is the Wild and can replace all symbols except the special bonus symbols. Landing five Wild symbols on a single spin awards the same payouts as the highest-paying symbol.\n\nScatter and Wild symbols\n\nThe Scatter symbol is represented by a barrel and landing three, four, or five of them allows players to spin for 6, 8, or 10 Free Spins.

With its well-designed graphics and exciting gameplay, this Light & Wonder production is sure to impress even the most seasoned gamblers.\n\nSet in a deep underground mine, Dynamite Frenzy features a red-haired miner from either Germany or Belgium who oversees the action. The well-crafted game board is supported by wooden and iron scaffolding and is adorned with colorful and precious gems on the background. The symbols, including the start and autoplay buttons, as well as the letters of the playing cards, are all carved into the stone.\n\nThe fast-paced music adds to the excitement of the gameplay, but can be muted if preferred. The game's simple 5-reel, 3-row grid has 10 fixed paylines, allowing bets as low as €0.01 per line, with each spin costing only €0.10. The Autoplay mode can be set for up to 100 spins, but players can also set a loss limit. The Turbo function, represented by a lightning bolt, allows for super-fast rotations of the symbols. With a medium volatility and a theoretical return to player percentage (RTP) of 95.95%, players have a chance to win big.\n\nTo win at Dynamite Frenzy, players must match three or more identical symbols starting from the first reel on the left and going to the right. The playing cards have a lower value while the pickaxe, lantern, beer mug, map, and helmet symbols have higher values. Three Cash symbols, represented by gold, silver, and bronze nuggets, each with its own multiplier, can be matched in any combination to win payouts. The golden tile is the Wild and can replace all symbols except the special bonus symbols. Landing five Wild symbols on a single spin awards the same payouts as the highest-paying symbol. The Scatter symbol is represented by a barrel and landing three, four, or five of them allows players to spin for 6, 8, or 10 Free Spins. The DWARF function, activated randomly during the base and bonus games with the miner holding a diamond, can turn regular symbols into cash nuggets with multipliers or bonus symbols.\n\nStill not sure about Dynamite Frenzy? Try the demo version on our website for free and without registration. You can also trigger Free Spins by landing Scatter symbols or by purchasing the feature for 55 times the bet. This exciting slot is available at Italian casinos with an AAMS certificate. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the explosive world of Dynamite Frenzy and claim your riches today!\n        ",
