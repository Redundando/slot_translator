La Gold Factory firmata Microgaming (una garanzia) è ambientata in un’immaginaria fabbrica in cui si produce l’oro e in quest’ambientazione luccicante e ricca si snoda il filo di un gioco molto divertente e abbastanza generoso, con un Return to player del 95,6%.\nGold Factory è una classica slot machine a 5 rulli con ben 50 linee di pagamento, su ognuna delle quelli è possibile effettuare puntate da un minimo di 1 fino a un massimo di 20 gettoni. Ogni gettone ha un valore in euro compreso tra 0,1 e 0,5 €, il che significa che la puntata massima potrà arrivare alla significativa cifre di 1000 €.\nLa grafica è molto ben fatta e lo sono anche le musiche di sottofondo, per cui giocare a Gold Factory risulta un’esperienza molto piacevole e coinvolgente.\nSimboli, Wild e Scatter in Gold Factory\nIn questa slot machine di casa Microgaming non troviamo le consuete carte da gioco, ma i simboli sono tutti a tema, sebbene per alcuni trovare il nesso con una fabbrica d’oro non sia stato così immediato!\nAbbiamo il Boss della Factory, un indispensabile alchimista, un carrello colmo di preziosi lingotti d’oro, tante monete scintillanti e infine un treno, un sottomarino e una mongolfiera, di cui non capiamo il senso ma che inseriti nel gioco sono comunque divertenti.\nIl simbolo Wild è rappresentato dal logo della slot e, come sempre, ha funzione di Jolly, sostituendosi a tutti gli altri simboli, eccezion fatta per lo Scatter. Inoltre, se il Wild compare su una linea di pagamento attiva in tutti i cinque rulli, permette di determinare la vincita più alta per il gioco regolare.\nLo Scatter, che ha valore di Bonus, è rappresentato proprio dal simbolo Bonus, e permette di accedere al gioco speciale a prescindere dalla linea di pagamento su cui compare e dalla posizione sui rulli.\nBoiler Room Bonus Game\nCon tre o più simboli Scatter in qualsiasi posizione sui rulli si attiva il gioco bonus chiamato “Boiler Room” e qui la questione si fa interessante: con questa funzionalità si potrebbe teoricamente vincere il jackpot di 619.000 gettoni!\nUna volta entrati nel gioco bonus (una sorta di stanza delle caldaie) compaiono 12 contenitori, tra i quali il giocatore dovrà sceglierne quattro: all’interno potrà trovare diversi simboli, a ciascuno dei quali corrisponde un premio o l’avvio di un’ulteriore funzionalità speciale, chiamata Chambers Room, dove ad attenderlo troverà tanti altri premi.\nGold Factory: conclusioni\nI giochi bonus rendono la slot molto avvincente, a fronte di un gameplay tutto sommato abbastanza lineare.\nIl jackpot stellare rappresenta certamente un goloso incentivo al gioco, anche se ottenerlo resta un’eventualità decisamente improbabile. Nel complesso si tratta di un gioco carino, come del resto quasi tutti quelli firmati dalla Microgaming, ideale per quei giocatori che non amano le grandi tecnologie e i gameplay troppo complicati\n",

Each coin has a value in euros ranging from €0.1 to €0.5, which means that the maximum bet can reach the significant amount of €1,000. Autoplay is also available.\n\nSymbols and Wild/Scatter functionality\n\nIn this Microgaming slot machine, all symbols are themed, with no playing cards included. The Boss of the Factory, an alchemist, a cart full of gold bars, glittering coins, a train, a submarine, and a hot air balloon make up the symbols. The Wild symbol is represented by the slot logo and replaces all other symbols except for the Scatter. The Scatter, represented by the Bonus symbol, triggers the special game regardless of the payline on which it appears. When the Wild symbol appears on all five reels, it allows for the highest payout for regular gameplay.\n\nBoiler Room Bonus Game\n\nWith three or more Scatter symbols in any position on the reels, the bonus game called 'Boiler Room' is activated. In this game, players can theoretically win the jackpot of 619,000 coins. Once inside the bonus game, 12 containers will appear, among which the player will need to choose four. Each container includes various symbols, each of which corresponds to a prize or the start of an additional special functionality, called Chambers Room, where the player can find even more prizes.\n\nGraphics and background music\n\nGold Factory has well-done graphics and background music that make it a pleasant and engaging experience while playing. The game is set in an imaginary factory where gold is produced, and the visuals and sound effects complement the theme well.\n\nJackpot and potential winnings\n\nGold Factory has a jackpot of 619,000 coins, making it a tantalizing incentive for players. However, obtaining it remains a considerably unlikely event. With a return to player of 95.6%, the game offers a fun and quite generous gaming experience. The betting range is from a minimum of €0.01 to a maximum of €1,000, making it suitable for players with different betting preferences. The bonus games make the gameplay exciting, making it an ideal game for those who enjoy more straightforward gameplay with some exciting extra features.\n\n        \n            ",

In addition, if the Wild appears on an active payline on all five reels, it allows for the highest payout for regular gameplay.\n\nThe Scatter, which has a bonus value, is represented by the Bonus symbol itself and allows access to the special game regardless of the payline on which it appears and its position on the reels.\n\nBoiler Room Bonus Game:\n\nWith three or more Scatter symbols in any position on the reels, the bonus game called \"Boiler Room\" is activated, and here things get interesting: with this functionality, it is theoretically possible to win the jackpot of 619,000 coins!\n\nOnce inside the bonus game (a kind of boiler room), 12 containers appear, among which the player will have to choose four: inside, he may find various symbols, each of which corresponds to a prize or the start of an additional special functionality, called Chambers Room, where he will find many other prizes.\n\nGold Factory: conclusions:\n\nThe bonus games make the slot machine very exciting, with a gameplay that is all in all quite linear.

Microgaming's (a guarantee) Gold Factory is set in an imaginary factory where gold is produced and in this glittering and rich setting, the thread of a very fun and quite generous game unfolds, with a return to player of 95.6%.\n\nGold Factory is a classic 5-reel slot machine with 50 paylines, on each of which it is possible to place bets from a minimum of 1 up to a maximum of 20 coins. Each coin has a value in euros ranging from €0.1 to €0.5, which means that the maximum bet can reach the significant amount of €1,000.\n\nThe graphics are very well done and so are the background music, making playing Gold Factory a very pleasant and engaging experience.\n\nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters in Gold Factory:\n\nIn this Microgaming slot machine, we do not find the usual playing cards, but the symbols are all themed, although for some, finding the connection with a gold factory was not so immediate!\nWe have the Boss of the Factory, an indispensable alchemist, a cart full of precious gold bars, many glittering coins, and finally a train, a submarine, and a hot air balloon, which we do not understand the meaning of, but are still fun in the game.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by the slot logo and, as always, has a function of joker, replacing all other symbols, except for the Scatter. In addition, if the Wild appears on an active payline on all five reels, it allows for the highest payout for regular gameplay.\n\nThe Scatter, which has a bonus value, is represented by the Bonus symbol itself and allows access to the special game regardless of the payline on which it appears and its position on the reels.\n\nBoiler Room Bonus Game:\n\nWith three or more Scatter symbols in any position on the reels, the bonus game called \"Boiler Room\" is activated, and here things get interesting: with this functionality, it is theoretically possible to win the jackpot of 619,000 coins!\n\nOnce inside the bonus game (a kind of boiler room), 12 containers appear, among which the player will have to choose four: inside, he may find various symbols, each of which corresponds to a prize or the start of an additional special functionality, called Chambers Room, where he will find many other prizes.\n\nGold Factory: conclusions:\n\nThe bonus games make the slot machine very exciting, with a gameplay that is all in all quite linear. The stellar jackpot certainly represents a tasty incentive to play, even if obtaining it remains a decidedly unlikely event. Overall, it is a cute game, like almost all those signed by Microgaming, ideal for players who do not like big technologies and overly complicated gameplay.\n            ",
