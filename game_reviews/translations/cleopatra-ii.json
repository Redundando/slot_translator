In this sequel, the game design is cleaner and brighter, with cute animated reel symbols and a fun and fluid gameplay. On this page, you can find a complete review with some small suggestions. Happy reading.\n\nHow to play?\nCleopatra 2 is played like any other online slot game, you select your bet and start playing. If you're good at matching any symbol on the 20 paylines, you can win a multiplier of your initial bet that will reward you for the matches obtained up to a maximum of 10,000 times your bet. The minimum bet is 1 cent up to a maximum of 5 euros. In addition to the mentioned features, the big difference between this and the original game is that every time the reels spin, the bonus multiplier in the top left of the screen increases. This means that after every spin, the payout will significantly increase.\n\nThe importance of symbols and bonuses\nThe Wild symbol (Cleopatra) works like the one in the first version. Having two or more of these will substitute any other symbol and increase your winnings. Additionally, every win including the Wild symbol is doubled. \nThe Pyramid symbol: if you get 3 or more of these anywhere on the reels, you will be entitled to 5/15 free spins. With 4 Pyramid symbols you win 8-18 free spins, with 5, 10-20 free spins and 200 times your original bet. The difference from the original game is that if you get two Pyramid symbols, you don't get double the win. \nThe Scatter symbol is represented by the iconic Sphinx. Three or more icons are enough to activate the Free Spin Round Bonus with 15 free spins up to a maximum of 180. If you get a winning combination during the Free Spin Bonus round, you can triple your winnings. During the standard game, scatter symbols allow you to double your bet if they appear on two or more reels.\n\nA slot to woo\nThe volatility of this game is very high and with an RTP of 95.13%, you can expect to go through long periods without winning anything in the base game, before triggering the free spin games. Although the valuable icons will blind you with their riches, you will have to be patient before making a substantial win.

In this sequel, the game design is cleaner and brighter, with cute animated reel symbols and a fun and fluid gameplay. On this page, you can find a complete review with some small suggestions. Happy reading.\n\nHow to play?\nCleopatra 2 is played like any other online slot game, you select your bet and start playing. If you're good at matching any symbol on the 20 paylines, you can win a multiplier of your initial bet that will reward you for the matches obtained up to a maximum of 10,000 times your bet. The minimum bet is 1 cent up to a maximum of 5 euros. In addition to the mentioned features, the big difference between this and the original game is that every time the reels spin, the bonus multiplier in the top left of the screen increases. This means that after every spin, the payout will significantly increase.\n\nThe importance of symbols and bonuses\nThe Wild symbol (Cleopatra) works like the one in the first version. Having two or more of these will substitute any other symbol and increase your winnings. Additionally, every win including the Wild symbol is doubled. \nThe Pyramid symbol: if you get 3 or more of these anywhere on the reels, you will be entitled to 5/15 free spins. With 4 Pyramid symbols you win 8-18 free spins, with 5, 10-20 free spins and 200 times your original bet. The difference from the original game is that if you get two Pyramid symbols, you don't get double the win. \nThe Scatter symbol is represented by the iconic Sphinx. Three or more icons are enough to activate the Free Spin Round Bonus with 15 free spins up to a maximum of 180. If you get a winning combination during the Free Spin Bonus round, you can triple your winnings. During the standard game, scatter symbols allow you to double your bet if they appear on two or more reels.\n\nA slot to woo\nThe volatility of this game is very high and with an RTP of 95.13%, you can expect to go through long periods without winning anything in the base game, before triggering the free spin games. Although the valuable icons will blind you with their riches, you will have to be patient before making a substantial win. We therefore recommend that you try the free demo version of Cleopatra 2 immediately and then take advantage of the welcome bonus by playing with real money in one of the casinos in our online catalog.\n            ",

It's like digging for gold – it may take a while, but when you finally strike it rich, you'll feel like a million bucks!</p><p> Now for those who are less patient, the high volatility of Cleopatra II may not be your cup of tea. However, that doesn't mean the game isn't worth a try. With an RTP of 95.13%, you'll still get decent payouts if you manage to get winning combinations. </p><p> Sure, the RTP is slightly lower than other online slot games, but that doesn't mean you can't walk away with substantial winnings. So if you're feeling lucky and don't mind waiting for the big win, give Cleopatra II a spin.</p>\"\n}"

There are 20 paylines in the game and if the player matches any symbol on these, they can win a multiplier of their initial bet. The minimum bet in the game is 1 cent and the maximum is 5 euros. The game features a bonus multiplier in the top left of the screen that increases after every spin, meaning that the payout will increase significantly.\n\nPayouts\n\nCleopatra II offers significant payouts for players who manage to get winning combinations, with a maximum payout of up to 10,000 times their initial bet. The game has a high volatility, meaning that players may have to go through long periods without winning anything before triggering the free spin games. The game also has an RTP of 95.13%.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe game features three main symbols that players need to watch out for. The Wild symbol, Cleopatra, works like the one in the original game, substituting any other symbol and doubling winnings if included in a win. The Pyramid symbol, which appears anywhere on the reels, entitles players to 5-20 free spins and up to 200 times their original bet. The Scatter symbol, represented by the Sphinx icon, activates the Free Spin Round Bonus when three or more appear, with players getting up to 180 free spins if they get the maximum number of Scatters. Any winning combinations during the Free Spin Bonus round will triple the player's winnings. Scatter symbols can also double the player's bet if they appear on two or more reels during the standard game.\n\nBonuses\n\nThe game offers various bonuses, including the bonus multiplier that increases after every spin and the Free Spin Round Bonus, which is activated when three or more Scatter symbols appear and offers players up to 180 free spins. The Pyramid symbol also entitles players to 5-20 free spins and up to 200 times their original bet.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nCleopatra II has a high volatility, meaning that players may have to go through long periods without winning anything before triggering the free spin games. The game also has an RTP of 95.13%, which is slightly lower than other online slot games but still offers players substantial payouts if they manage to get winning combinations.\n\n        \n            ",

In this sequel, the game design is cleaner and brighter, with cute animated reel symbols and a fun and fluid gameplay. On this page, you can find a complete review with some small suggestions. Happy reading.\n\nHow to play?\nCleopatra 2 is played like any other online slot game, you select your bet and start playing. If you're good at matching any symbol on the 20 paylines, you can win a multiplier of your initial bet that will reward you for the matches obtained up to a maximum of 10,000 times your bet. The minimum bet is 1 cent up to a maximum of 5 euros. In addition to the mentioned features, the big difference between this and the original game is that every time the reels spin, the bonus multiplier in the top left of the screen increases. This means that after every spin, the payout will significantly increase.\n\nThe importance of symbols and bonuses\nThe Wild symbol (Cleopatra) works like the one in the first version. Having two or more of these will substitute any other symbol and increase your winnings. Additionally, every win including the Wild symbol is doubled. \nThe Pyramid symbol: if you get 3 or more of these anywhere on the reels, you will be entitled to 5/15 free spins. With 4 Pyramid symbols you win 8-18 free spins, with 5, 10-20 free spins and 200 times your original bet. The difference from the original game is that if you get two Pyramid symbols, you don't get double the win. \nThe Scatter symbol is represented by the iconic Sphinx. Three or more icons are enough to activate the Free Spin Round Bonus with 15 free spins up to a maximum of 180. If you get a winning combination during the Free Spin Bonus round, you can triple your winnings. During the standard game, scatter symbols allow you to double your bet if they appear on two or more reels.\n\nA slot to woo\nThe volatility of this game is very high and with an RTP of 95.13%, you can expect to go through long periods without winning anything in the base game, before triggering the free spin games. Although the valuable icons will blind you with their riches, you will have to be patient before making a substantial win. We therefore recommend that you try the free demo version of Cleopatra 2 immediately and then take advantage of the welcome bonus by playing with real money in one of the casinos in our online catalog.\n            ",

In this sequel, the game design is cleaner and brighter, with cute animated reel symbols and a fun and fluid gameplay. On this page, you can find a complete review with some small suggestions. Happy reading.\n\nHow to play?\nCleopatra 2 is played like any other online slot game, you select your bet and start playing. If you're good at matching any symbol on the 20 paylines, you can win a multiplier of your initial bet that will reward you for the matches obtained up to a maximum of 10,000 times your bet. The minimum bet is 1 cent up to a maximum of 5 euros. In addition to the mentioned features, the big difference between this and the original game is that every time the reels spin, the bonus multiplier in the top left of the screen increases. This means that after every spin, the payout will significantly increase.\n\nThe importance of symbols and bonuses\nThe Wild symbol (Cleopatra) works like the one in the first version. Having two or more of these will substitute any other symbol and increase your winnings. Additionally, every win including the Wild symbol is doubled. \nThe Pyramid symbol: if you get 3 or more of these anywhere on the reels, you will be entitled to 5/15 free spins. With 4 Pyramid symbols you win 8-18 free spins, with 5, 10-20 free spins and 200 times your original bet. The difference from the original game is that if you get two Pyramid symbols, you don't get double the win. \nThe Scatter symbol is represented by the iconic Sphinx. Three or more icons are enough to activate the Free Spin Round Bonus with 15 free spins up to a maximum of 180. If you get a winning combination during the Free Spin Bonus round, you can triple your winnings. During the standard game, scatter symbols allow you to double your bet if they appear on two or more reels.\n\nA slot to woo\nThe volatility of this game is very high and with an RTP of 95.13%, you can expect to go through long periods without winning anything in the base game, before triggering the free spin games. Although the valuable icons will blind you with their riches, you will have to be patient before making a substantial win. We therefore recommend that you try the free demo version of Cleopatra 2 immediately and then take advantage of the welcome bonus by playing with real money in one of the casinos in our online catalog.\n            ",
