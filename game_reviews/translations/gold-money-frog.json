Today more than ever, Chinese culture has become famous throughout the world thanks to films and literature. One aspect of Chinese culture that is becoming increasingly popular is luck.\n\nGold Money Frog by NetEnt allows us a good dose of luck with one of the Chinese symbols of good auspice: the frog. According to Chinese culture, this amphibian brings wealth and good health.\n\nLet's start, therefore, the review of this slot.\n\nGold Money Frog - Graphics\n\nSurrounded by graceful pink lotus flowers that seem suspended above the water's surface while in the background we glimpse a pagoda illuminated by lanterns, we find the game grid of Gold Mone Frog.\n\nThe grid seems carved into wood and thus constitutes a graceful frame for the various symbols that we will see scrolling on the reels of the slot. A detail that is often forgotten or left aside, instead becomes an integral part of the graphics of Gold Money Frog.\n\nLet's talk about the symbols. Despite the slot being clearly Chinese-themed, the symbols of Western cards (A, K, Q, J) are proposed with colored fonts and a glossy and well-groomed appearance. Together with these online slot classics, we also find symbols that completely refer to Chinese culture. First of all, the golden frog and the symbol of the slot itself, but we will also see the golden bat (another lucky animal), a red talisman, and even a bridge typical of the beautiful Chinese gardens.\n\nGold Money Frog is a slot with a pleasant and well-groomed appearance down to the smallest details. Certainly, aesthetically, it demonstrates excellent quality and is in line with the Chinese setting that NetEnt wants to offer us.\n\nBut now let's move on to the next point where we will analyze the gameplay of the slot.\n\nGold Money Frog - Three different jackpots\n\nMoving on to the technical aspect, we find ourselves in front of a slot with an RTP that ranges from 92.31% to 92.96%... not one of the highest values in the market, but enough to exceed the minimum limit imposed by law and make the game enjoyable and fun.\n\nIn terms of volatility, we are talking about a value equal to L, which can indicate a large number of winning combinations during our plays but with a rather low value.\n\nFrom a game grid point of view, we are facing a classic 5*3 type slot, with an interface that perfectly matches the mobile game. At the top of the screen, the different jackpots that can be accessed through the bonus mode are displayed.\n\nThis is triggered through the Scatter symbols of the Wheel: by finding at least three of them, it is indeed possible to access a kind of wheel of fortune where it will be possible to obtain different prizes.\n\nSlots similar to Gold Money Frog\n\nOnline slots that speak of good luck in Chinese culture are growing more and more. Among these, we find: Lucky Bats, Feng Fu, Feng Shui Kitties, Wild 888, Gu Gu Gu 2, and WuFu LinMen.\n            ",

Today more than ever, Chinese culture has become famous throughout the world thanks to films and literature. One aspect of Chinese culture that is becoming increasingly popular is luck.\n\nGold Money Frog by NetEnt allows us a good dose of luck with one of the Chinese symbols of good auspice: the frog. According to Chinese culture, this amphibian brings wealth and good health.\n\nLet's start, therefore, the review of this slot.\n\nGold Money Frog - Graphics\n\nSurrounded by graceful pink lotus flowers that seem suspended above the water's surface while in the background we glimpse a pagoda illuminated by lanterns, we find the game grid of Gold Mone Frog.\n\nThe grid seems carved into wood and thus constitutes a graceful frame for the various symbols that we will see scrolling on the reels of the slot. A detail that is often forgotten or left aside, instead becomes an integral part of the graphics of Gold Money Frog.\n\nLet's talk about the symbols. Despite the slot being clearly Chinese-themed, the symbols of Western cards (A, K, Q, J) are proposed with colored fonts and a glossy and well-groomed appearance. Together with these online slot classics, we also find symbols that completely refer to Chinese culture. First of all, the golden frog and the symbol of the slot itself, but we will also see the golden bat (another lucky animal), a red talisman, and even a bridge typical of the beautiful Chinese gardens.\n\nGold Money Frog is a slot with a pleasant and well-groomed appearance down to the smallest details. Certainly, aesthetically, it demonstrates excellent quality and is in line with the Chinese setting that NetEnt wants to offer us.\n\nBut now let's move on to the next point where we will analyze the gameplay of the slot.\n\nGold Money Frog - Three different jackpots\n\nMoving on to the technical aspect, we find ourselves in front of a slot with an RTP that ranges from 92.31% to 92.96%... not one of the highest values in the market, but enough to exceed the minimum limit imposed by law and make the game enjoyable and fun.\n\nIn terms of volatility, we are talking about a value equal to L, which can indicate a large number of winning combinations during our plays but with a rather low value.\n\nFrom a game grid point of view, we are facing a classic 5*3 type slot, with an interface that perfectly matches the mobile game. At the top of the screen, the different jackpots that can be accessed through the bonus mode are displayed.\n\nThis is triggered through the Scatter symbols of the Wheel: by finding at least three of them, it is indeed possible to access a kind of wheel of fortune where it will be possible to obtain different prizes.\n\nSlots similar to Gold Money Frog\n\nOnline slots that speak of good luck in Chinese culture are growing more and more. Among these, we find: Lucky Bats, Feng Fu, Feng Shui Kitties, Wild 888, Gu Gu Gu 2, and WuFu LinMen.\n            ",
