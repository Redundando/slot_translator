Think of the Egyptian gods, medieval bestiaries, or even everyday expressions such as \"strong as a bull\" or \"brave as a lion\". That's why the world of online slots couldn't stay behind, and we increasingly find titles that use the beautiful animals that populate our world as a theme.\n\nSpeaking of the savannah, today we're going to review King of Africa by WMS, a slot whose title already lets us know which animal will be the protagonist.\n\nKing of Africa: the graphic aspect\n\nWhen we open a slot for the first time, we give enormous importance to the visual and sound aspect of the title. So, let's start talking about this: the slot is framed by the savannah, and as expected from a title with this theme, the dominant colors are yellow and red (and all the shades in between).\n\nInside the game grid, we find several animals that play the lead role in this game: from the inevitable lion, to antelopes, zebras, elephants, and cheetahs. In addition to these, there are also objects that refer to native African populations and allow us to immerse ourselves even further in the atmosphere.\n\nThe music only activates at the moment of spinning the reels, so we can enjoy silent breaks between one round and another.\n\nKing of Africa: game mechanics\nThe slot presents itself following numerous online game archetypes: we are, in fact, facing a title that exploits a 5×3 game grid where twenty pay lines can be found. The slot's RTP, that is, the return for the player (money issued in the form of winnings compared to those played) is 92.14%. A rather low value compared to market standards but still enjoyable.\n\nAmong the various symbols we find in the game, our attention focuses mainly on the title of the slot itself, which covers the role of Wild symbol (a joker capable of replacing all other regular symbols) and the tree in the savannah, which instead is a Scatter symbol.\n\nAs such, finding at least three in a single game (it's not essential that they are found along the same pay line) triggers the bonus mode. Finding two, instead, can trigger a respin of the other reels, increasing the probability of triggering the bonus.\n\nSlots similar to King of Africa\nAfrica is not a new theme when it comes to online slots, and if this world interests us and we want to explore other titles that exploit the same topic, we can take a look at the vast catalog available to us.\n\nIn its various shades, the Ancient Continent is exploited in the Africa Untamed slot by Barcrest, in Soccer Safari by Microgaming, and in King of the Jungle and Savanna Moon by Bally Wulff.\n            ",

The game's Wild symbol is its title, replacing other regular symbols. The tree in the savannah is the Scatter symbol; finding three or more in a spin triggers the bonus mode, while finding two can trigger a respin of the other reels.\n\nGame Design and Graphics\n\nKing of Africa has a savannah theme, with dominant colors of yellow and red. The game frame is the savannah itself, and the game grid features animals like lions, zebras, cheetahs, antelopes, elephants, and objects representing native African populations. There is no constant background music; the music only plays when the reels are spinning.\n\nSymbols and Bonus Features\n\nThe game's most important symbols are the Wild symbol (the title) and the Scatter symbol (the tree in the savannah). Three or more Scatters trigger the bonus mode, while two Scatters can trigger a respin of the other reels. There are also other regular symbols, like playing cards, that can be substituted by the Wild symbol.\n\nRTP and Payout\n\nKing of Africa boasts an RTP of 92.14%, which is low compared to the market's current standards but still reasonable. The game offers payouts, the details of which depend on the symbols and their combinations. The highest-paying symbol is the lion, which can payout up to 500 credits.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nFor players interested in exploring Africa-themed slots further, the market offers plenty of options. Some of these include Africa Untamed by Barcrest, Soccer Safari by Microgaming, and King of the Jungle and Savanna Moon by Bally Wulff.\n\n        \n            ",

Think of the Egyptian gods, medieval bestiaries, or even everyday expressions such as \"strong as a bull\" or \"brave as a lion\". That's why the world of online slots couldn't stay behind, and we increasingly find titles that use the beautiful animals that populate our world as a theme.\n\nSpeaking of the savannah, today we're going to review King of Africa by WMS, a slot whose title already lets us know which animal will be the protagonist.\n\nKing of Africa: the graphic aspect\n\nWhen we open a slot for the first time, we give enormous importance to the visual and sound aspect of the title. So, let's start talking about this: the slot is framed by the savannah, and as expected from a title with this theme, the dominant colors are yellow and red (and all the shades in between).\n\nInside the game grid, we find several animals that play the lead role in this game: from the inevitable lion, to antelopes, zebras, elephants, and cheetahs. In addition to these, there are also objects that refer to native African populations and allow us to immerse ourselves even further in the atmosphere.\n\nThe music only activates at the moment of spinning the reels, so we can enjoy silent breaks between one round and another.\n\nKing of Africa: game mechanics\nThe slot presents itself following numerous online game archetypes: we are, in fact, facing a title that exploits a 5×3 game grid where twenty pay lines can be found. The slot's RTP, that is, the return for the player (money issued in the form of winnings compared to those played) is 92.14%. A rather low value compared to market standards but still enjoyable.\n\nAmong the various symbols we find in the game, our attention focuses mainly on the title of the slot itself, which covers the role of Wild symbol (a joker capable of replacing all other regular symbols) and the tree in the savannah, which instead is a Scatter symbol.\n\nAs such, finding at least three in a single game (it's not essential that they are found along the same pay line) triggers the bonus mode. Finding two, instead, can trigger a respin of the other reels, increasing the probability of triggering the bonus.\n\nSlots similar to King of Africa\nAfrica is not a new theme when it comes to online slots, and if this world interests us and we want to explore other titles that exploit the same topic, we can take a look at the vast catalog available to us.\n\nIn its various shades, the Ancient Continent is exploited in the Africa Untamed slot by Barcrest, in Soccer Safari by Microgaming, and in King of the Jungle and Savanna Moon by Bally Wulff.\n            ",
