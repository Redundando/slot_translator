Insomma, da Ace Ventura, passando per Batman e Rick e Morty fino ad arrivare a Dracula e Sherlock Holmes, molti produttori hanno provato a catturare le atmosfere di un particolare prodotto per portarlo al pubblico delle slot machine. La Giocaonline porta questo trend su un nuovo fronte, basando una slot machine su una canzone: Il Ballo Del Qua Qua. Quale sarà stato il risultato? Scopriamolo cominciando ad analizzare prima l’aspetto grafico e poi il gameplay.\nIl Ballo Del Qua Qua – Una dolce slot machine\nL’aspetto grafico de Il Ballo Del Qua Qua è estremamente classico e semplice. I simpatici disegni in stile cartone animato danno vita ad uno stagno (che fa da sfondo) abitato dai più disparati personaggi, che ritroveremo nei vari simboli. Troviamo infatti papere innamorate, una famigliola di paperelle che balla, un anatroccolo nero e uno giallo e uno stormo di anatre in volo, ma gli uccelli non sono gli unici abitanti della palude, troviamo infatti anche una libellula, un pesce e una farfalla. A fare da simbolo bonus troviamo due papere che muovono i fianchi, mentre come simbolo Wild una semplice ninfea. Nel cast troviamo anche una rana, protagonista del suo minigioco esclusivo.\nCome colonna sonora invece non poteva mancare la canzone che dà ispirazione alla slot: Il Ballo Del Qua Qua! Nonostante sia una scelta azzeccata, per alcuni potrebbe risultare fastidioso sentirla in loop per tutta la giocata, soprattutto perché non è accompagnata da nessun altro effetto sonoro degno di nota.\nIl Ballo Del Qua Qua – Tanti giochi in uno\nIl Ballo Del Qua Qua si presenta con una volatilità alta, ma con un RTP del “solo” 94.4%, che potrebbe far storcere il naso a qualcuno. Ciò nonostante, il Ballo Del Qua Qua è una slot degna di essere provata, specialmente per chi è interessato a giocate ricche di variazioni e minigiochi. Quando si otterranno tre o più simboli bonus, sul primo, sul terzo e sul quinto rullo, avrà inizio il gioco “Il Giro Del Qua Qua”, un tabellone ispirato al gioco dell’oca sul quale verrà lanciato un dato per avanzare e vincere moltiplicatori e giri gratuiti. Le caselle del tabellone sono 23 e il giocatore avrà a disposizione 5 tiri di dado per poter ottenere più bonus possibili. Ottenendo invece 2 simboli bonus, uno sul primo rullo e uno sul quinto, raffiguranti la rana, si attiverà il suo minigioco, in cui la vedremo cimentarsi in una gara di salto su delle ninfee. La ninfea su cui la rana dovrà saltare (ce ne sono 6 in totale) verrà scelta dal giocatore, e se questa rivelerà un importo da aggiungere alla vincita totale, allora il giocatore potrà selezionarne un’altra. Se però la ninfea dovesse rivelarsi priva di un importo da vincere, la rana cadrà nell’acqua e il minigioco avrà fine.\nSlot simili al Ballo Del Qua Qua\nInsomma, Il Ballo Del Qua Qua, nonostante il suo aspetto cartoonesco e il suo gameplay di base semplice, nasconde dei minigiochi interessanti che danno varietà e freschezza alle giocate. Se siete in cerca di slot machine dall’aspetto rilassante e con tematiche non troppo mature, Bee Frenzy e Beetle Jewels faranno sicuramente al caso vostro.\n",

From Ace Ventura to Batman, Rick and Morty to Dracula and Sherlock Holmes, many producers have tried to capture the atmospheres of a particular product and bring it to the slot machine audience. Giocaonline is now taking this trend to a new level, by basing a slot machine on a song: Il Ballo Del Qua Qua. So, what will be the result? Let's find out by first analyzing the graphics and then the gameplay.\n\nIl Ballo Del Qua Qua - A Sweet Slot Machine\n\nThe graphic aspect of Il Ballo Del Qua Qua is extremely classic and simple. The charming cartoon-style drawings bring to life a pond (which serves as a background) inhabited by various characters, all of which we will find in the various symbols. We find love-struck ducks, a family of dancing ducklings, a black and yellow duckling, a flock of flying ducks, as well as a dragonfly, a fish, and a butterfly. The bonus symbol is represented by two ducks shaking their hips, while the Wild symbol is a simple water lily. The cast also includes a frog, the star of its own exclusive mini-game.\n\nAs for the soundtrack, the song that inspired the slot, Il Ballo Del Qua Qua, could not be missing! Although it is a good choice, some may find it annoying to hear it in a loop throughout the game, especially since it is not accompanied by any other noteworthy sound effect.\n\nIl Ballo Del Qua Qua - Many Games in One\n\nIl Ballo Del Qua Qua has a high volatility, but with an RTP of \"only\" 94.4%, which might turn some people off. Nevertheless, Il Ballo Del Qua Qua is a slot worth trying, especially for those interested in gameplay rich in variations and mini-games. When three or more bonus symbols are obtained on the first, third, and fifth reels, the \"Il Giro Del Qua Qua\" game will begin, a board game inspired by the game of goose in which a die will be rolled to advance and win multipliers and free spins. The board has 23 squares and the player will have 5 die rolls to obtain as many bonuses as possible. By obtaining 2 bonus symbols, one on the first reel and one on the fifth, depicting the frog, her mini-game will be activated, in which we will see her compete in a jumping race on water lilies. The water lily on which the frog will jump (there are 6 in total) will be chosen by the player, and if it reveals an amount to add to the total winnings, then the player can select another one. If, however, the water lily turns out to be without winning amount, the frog will fall into the water and the mini-game will end.\n\nSimilar Slots to Il Ballo Del Qua Qua\n\nIn summary, Il Ballo Del Qua Qua, despite its cartoonish appearance and simple basic gameplay, hides interesting mini-games that add variety and freshness to the gameplay. If you are looking for slot machines with a relaxing appearance and themes that are not too mature, Bee Frenzy and Beetle Jewels will surely suit your tastes.\n            ",
