The minimum bet is 10 tokens, making a total of €0.20 for each spin. There is a wide range of automatic spins, which can be set between 10 to 500, with fast spin options also available.

The sound quality is excellent, with Jingle Bells played in a delightful jazz twist, enhancing the player's gaming experience. \n\nPayouts and RTP\n\nThe game's high volatility means that players need to make a considerable number of spins to attain a win. However, the payouts are always excellent, with a theoretical Return to Player (RTP) of 96.66%. The Nudge function is a special feature that can be bought and used to boost payouts.

There is also a progressive jackpot feature that can be randomly triggered, adding a significant amount to the player's balance!\n\n        \n            ",

Christmas remains the most joyful and festive season of the year for many. And what better way to celebrate Christmas than by playing the exquisite slot game \"Christmas Gift Rush\"!\nThe game's graphics are absolutely outstanding, with snowflakes falling onto the roofs of buildings illuminated by the warm glow of the fireplace. The symbols are large and brightly colored, and the console provides an excellent overview of all the options available to optimize our gameplay. The music can only be Jingle Bells, but with a delightful jazz twist.\nSlot Features\nThe essential game grid has three reels and three rows, with a token value fixed at €0.02. You must bet at least 10 tokens, cost-per-spin being just €0.20.\nThe number of automatic spins that can be activated ranges from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 500, and for those who want to, the fast spin of the reels can be set using the cursor.\nThe volatility is high, so it's necessary to make a considerable number of spins to win, but the payouts are always excellent.\nAs for the theoretical return to player (RTP), it's 96.66%.\nSymbols and functionalities\nIn Christmas Gift Rush, we have just four bow-wrapped symbols: the green lollipop, the blue teddy bear, the golden bell, and the yellow toy truck.\nThe Christmas gift is the Wild symbol and replaces all the others.\nInitially, the only payline is the central one outlined by a green decoration around the row. Upon the first win, the Nudge function is activated: this means the row above is enabled, followed by the one below, and in the case of further wins, a multiplier of +1 is applied each time.\nDuring the game, you may randomly activate a progressive jackpot displayed in a box next to the slot's title.\nFor those who want it, the Nudge function can be purchased. The number of Nudges available is 30. Considering that the cost of each spin is quite low, it's advisable to focus on this special feature that can give us extraordinarily high payouts!\n        ",
