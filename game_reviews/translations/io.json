            "response": "Elk Studios rockets us back into space with Io, a space-themed slot game following in the footsteps of their previous game, Cygnus. Io is a high volatility game with a maximum payout of 5,000 times the bet. It offers a setup with 6 reels that can expand to give you up to 262,144 ways to win. Io also features wild symbols, bonus symbols, Charged Wilds, the Wild Forge with its multipliers, and other exciting features. With an RTP of 96%, Io is definitely worth a try.\n\nThe graphics of Io are attention-grabbing with fast and luminous features, strange sounds, and explosive animations. However, it may seem like you’re not winning much in the base game, unless you expand the grid to the maximum of 8 rows. The 96% RTP is mostly aimed towards the free games that may take some time to trigger but are worth watching. If you’re lucky enough, you may even get a significant return on investment. In the end, Io is just a variant of the games listed in the introduction, so the recipe for winning is fairly familiar. The choice of taking a trip to Io is entirely up to you, experienced gamblers.\n\nThe background graphics suggest that the slot machine is set in space and the game area is undoubtedly interesting to look at. However, you won’t find a list of futuristic-themed symbols here, instead, you’ll find the Bonus Planet, the Wild Logo, Lucky 7s, Diamonds, Clovers, Blue Stars, and four Poker card symbols.\n\nIo begins with 6 reels and 4 rows of symbols where wins are formed by landing matching symbols on consecutive reels from the left to right. The game area can expand, doubling in size, and providing up to 262,144 ways to win. The falling symbols activate at every win, as the involved symbols are removed and replaced with new symbols. The Charged Wilds symbols are the only ones that remain. With each new wave of symbols, the number of rows on the screen increases, providing more ways to win.\n\nThe game features wild symbols that are used when they land and are substituted for any other symbols within a payline to create a winning combination or make it better. You can also enter the free spin mode by landing 3 Bonus scatters. This will grant you access to Free Spins where you can get the Wild Forge and Charged Wilds symbols.\n\nThe Charged Wilds are wild symbols that come in 4 different variations. They activate when part of a win, transforming into normal wilds on the fourth consecutive spin before disappearing. The Wild Forge adds a wild multiplier to empty spaces below it. Use the forge multiple times to increase the multiplier, and once it reaches the bottom, the symbol will transform into a multiplier wild. The laser is a feature that has laser rays from special symbols intersecting to transform all the touched positions into wild symbols.\n\nElk Studios never seems to change the betting system in any of their games. The range is always the same, from €0.20 to €100, and it's made up of 100 coins regardless of the selected value. However, coin values up to €1 can be bet.\n\nIo is a game with a vast play area and many ways to win and can compete with other Megaways slots. It's more than capable of providing substantial rewards, with the highest potential win of 5,000 times the bet or up to €500,000. However, with great rewards comes a higher risk of losing, so expect high volatility with this game. On the other hand, with an RTP set at 96%, you can trust that the game is not unfair, but it does come with higher stakes.\n\nCollect 3 Bonus Scatters to gain 7 free spins that can be redeemed. Now you can play on 8 rows at maximum or all 262,144 ways. The Charged or Wild Forge symbols will remain on the grid for the next free fall, but the Charged Wild will lose a life between games. You can win up to 5,000 times the bet before the bonus ends, or when you run out of free spins.\n\nIf you enjoyed Io, you may also like Elk Studio's other Cascading Reels slot game, Cygnus. Cygnus provides a gravity effect where the tiles are round and will roll to the lowest point.\n\nAs an experienced gambler, you know that Io is a space-themed slot game with impressive graphics, unique features, and several ways to win. So, try your luck and land those winning combinations with Io.",

Questo significa che le tessere sono rotonde e se diciamo che c’è una pendenza a sinistra sopra le prime 5 bobine da destra a sinistra e una tessera scende nella colonna 6, rotolerà a sinistra e raggiungerà il punto più basso.\nIl gioco è un meccanismo di modi e si inizia con 6 colonne di 4 simboli ciascuna e 4096 modi per vincere. Devi pagare 100 monete piuttosto alte per giocare e i 6 di una tessera sono 30x 7, 3x Gatto, 2x Cammello, 0,8x Cicogna e 3 colori Gem pagando rispettivamente 0,3, 0,25 e 0,2x. C’è anche una tessera ‘W’ Wild.\n\n        ",

                            "content": "The Io slot game by Elk Studios takes you on an intergalactic journey that is sure to keep experienced gamblers entertained. This game offers a high volatility with a maximum payout of 5,000x your bet, and a setup featuring 6 reels that can expand to provide up to 262,144 ways to win. Io also features wild symbols, bonus symbols, Charged Wilds, the Wild Forge with its multipliers, and other exciting features. With an RTP of 96%, Io is a must-try for any serious gambler.\n\nThe game's unique and space-themed graphics are visually captivating, with fast-paced animations, strange sounds, and explosive effects that are sure to catch your attention. While you may not win big in the base game, expanding the game grid to 8 rows can increase your winnings significantly. The free games mode may take some time to trigger, but it offers excellent potential for decent payouts.\n\nThe game board is set in outer space, and while there are no symbols themed around extra-terrestrial life, you will find symbols such as Bonus Planet, the Wild logo, Lucky 7s, Diamonds, Clovers, Blue Stars, and four playing card symbols.\n\nWhen starting the game, you are presented with six reels and four rows of symbols, with winning combinations formed by landing matching symbols on consecutive reels from left to right. The playing field can expand to double its size, providing up to 262,144 ways to win.\n\nSymbols that form winning combinations activate a cascading effect, with the involved symbols being replaced by new symbols. Charged Wilds are the only symbols that do not get replaced. As the cascade continues, the number of rows on the screen increases, leading to more ways to win.\n\nThe Wild symbols can substitute for any other symbol on the payline, while the Free Games mode is triggered by landing three Bonus scatters. During free games mode, you get access to Spin-for-Free rounds, and can also activate Charged Wilds and the Wild Forge features.\n\nCharged Wilds are wilds that show up in four different types. They become normal wilds after the fourth consecutive spin, after which they disappear. Wild Forge adds a multiplier to wilds in the empty spaces beneath it. Use the Wild Forge several times to increase the multiplier further, and once it reaches the bottom, it becomes a multiplier wild.\n\nThe laser feature uses special symbols to shoot laser beams that intersect, transforming all the positions they touch into wilds.\n\nAs with other Elk Studios games, the betting range for Io is from €0.20 to €100, with 100 coins in total, regardless of the selected coin value. However, you can wager coins of up to €1.\n\nIo is a game with a massive playing field, lots of ways to win, and the potential for big rewards. It can compete with other slot games in the Megaways series, and the game's highest payout potential is up to 5,000x the bet or up to €500,000.\n\nWith high rewards come higher risks, so Io has an expected high volatility. However, with an RTP of 96%, you are assured of a fair game, even though there are higher risks involved.\n\nAccumulate three Bonus scatters to win seven free games. During the free game rounds, you play on eight rows or on the full 262,144 win ways. Charged or Wild Forge symbols remain on the board after each free game round, with the Charged Wild losing a life between rounds. You can win up to 5,000x your bet before the bonus game ends.\n\nIo by Elk Studios is a variant of their Cascading Reels game, Cygnus. Cygnus has an interesting game mechanism that uses a gravity effect to allow symbols to roll down indented columns, providing players with a unique experience. The game starts with six columns of four symbols each and 4,096 ways to win, with different symbols offering varying payout values. There is also a Wild symbol represented by 'W'.\n\nIf you're looking for a unique and exciting space-themed slot game, Io is an excellent choice that's sure to captivate your attention and offer great rewards."

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Io\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nElk Studios rockets us back into space with Io, a space-themed slot game following in the footsteps of their previous game, Cygnus. Io is a high volatility game with a maximum payout of 5,000 times the bet. It offers a setup with 6 reels that can expand to give you up to 262,144 ways to win. Io also features wild symbols, bonus symbols, Charged Wilds, the Wild Forge with its multipliers, and other exciting features. With an RTP of 96%, Io is definitely worth a try.\n\nThe graphics of Io are attention-grabbing with fast and luminous features, strange sounds, and explosive animations. However, it may seem like you’re not winning much in the base game, unless you expand the grid to the maximum of 8 rows. The 96% RTP is mostly aimed towards the free games that may take some time to trigger but are worth watching. If you’re lucky enough, you may even get a significant return on investment. In the end, Io is just a variant of the games listed in the introduction, so the recipe for winning is fairly familiar. The choice of taking a trip to Io is entirely up to you, experienced gamblers.\n\nThe background graphics suggest that the slot machine is set in space and the game area is undoubtedly interesting to look at. However, you won’t find a list of futuristic-themed symbols here, instead, you’ll find the Bonus Planet, the Wild Logo, Lucky 7s, Diamonds, Clovers, Blue Stars, and four Poker card symbols.\n\nIo begins with 6 reels and 4 rows of symbols where wins are formed by landing matching symbols on consecutive reels from the left to right. The game area can expand, doubling in size, and providing up to 262,144 ways to win. The falling symbols activate at every win, as the involved symbols are removed and replaced with new symbols. The Charged Wilds symbols are the only ones that remain. With each new wave of symbols, the number of rows on the screen increases, providing more ways to win.\n\nThe game features wild symbols that are used when they land and are substituted for any other symbols within a payline to create a winning combination or make it better. You can also enter the free spin mode by landing 3 Bonus scatters. This will grant you access to Free Spins where you can get the Wild Forge and Charged Wilds symbols.\n\nThe Charged Wilds are wild symbols that come in 4 different variations. They activate when part of a win, transforming into normal wilds on the fourth consecutive spin before disappearing. The Wild Forge adds a wild multiplier to empty spaces below it. Use the forge multiple times to increase the multiplier, and once it reaches the bottom, the symbol will transform into a multiplier wild. The laser is a feature that has laser rays from special symbols intersecting to transform all the touched positions into wild symbols.\n\nElk Studios never seems to change the betting system in any of their games. The range is always the same, from €0.20 to €100, and it's made up of 100 coins regardless of the selected value. However, coin values up to €1 can be bet.\n\nIo is a game with a vast play area and many ways to win and can compete with other Megaways slots. It's more than capable of providing substantial rewards, with the highest potential win of 5,000 times the bet or up to €500,000. However, with great rewards comes a higher risk of losing, so expect high volatility with this game. On the other hand, with an RTP set at 96%, you can trust that the game is not unfair, but it does come with higher stakes.\n\nCollect 3 Bonus Scatters to gain 7 free spins that can be redeemed. Now you can play on 8 rows at maximum or all 262,144 ways. The Charged or Wild Forge symbols will remain on the grid for the next free fall, but the Charged Wild will lose a life between games. You can win up to 5,000 times the bet before the bonus ends, or when you run out of free spins.\n\nIf you enjoyed Io, you may also like Elk Studio's other Cascading Reels slot game, Cygnus. Cygnus provides a gravity effect where the tiles are round and will roll to the lowest point.\n\nAs an experienced gambler, you know that Io is a space-themed slot game with impressive graphics, unique features, and several ways to win. So, try your luck and land those winning combinations with Io.\n        ",

Io is a high volatility game with a maximum payout of 5,000 times the bet. It offers a setup with 6 reels that can expand to give you up to 262,144 ways to win. Io also features wild symbols, bonus symbols, Charged Wilds, the Wild Forge with its multipliers, and other exciting features. With an RTP of 96%, Io is definitely worth a try.\n\nThe graphics of Io are attention-grabbing with fast and luminous features, strange sounds, and explosive animations. However, it may seem like you’re not winning much in the base game, unless you expand the grid to the maximum of 8 rows. The 96% RTP is mostly aimed towards the free games that may take some time to trigger but are worth watching. If you’re lucky enough, you may even get a significant return on investment. In the end, Io is just a variant of the games listed in the introduction, so the recipe for winning is fairly familiar. The choice of taking a trip to Io is entirely up to you, experienced gamblers.\n\nThe background graphics suggest that the slot machine is set in space and the game area is undoubtedly interesting to look at. However, you won’t find a list of futuristic-themed symbols here, instead, you’ll find the Bonus Planet, the Wild Logo, Lucky 7s, Diamonds, Clovers, Blue Stars, and four Poker card symbols.\n\nIo begins with 6 reels and 4 rows of symbols where wins are formed by landing matching symbols on consecutive reels from the left to right. The game area can expand, doubling in size, and providing up to 262,144 ways to win. The falling symbols activate at every win, as the involved symbols are removed and replaced with new symbols. The Charged Wilds symbols are the only ones that remain. With each new wave of symbols, the number of rows on the screen increases, providing more ways to win.\n\nThe game features wild symbols that are used when they land and are substituted for any other symbols within a payline to create a winning combination or make it better. You can also enter the free spin mode by landing 3 Bonus scatters. This will grant you access to Free Spins where you can get the Wild Forge and Charged Wilds symbols.\n\nThe Charged Wilds are wild symbols that come in 4 different variations. They activate when part of a win, transforming into normal wilds on the fourth consecutive spin before disappearing. The Wild Forge adds a wild multiplier to empty spaces below it. Use the forge multiple times to increase the multiplier, and once it reaches the bottom, the symbol will transform into a multiplier wild. The laser is a feature that has laser rays from special symbols intersecting to transform all the touched positions into wild symbols.\n\nElk Studios never seems to change the betting system in any of their games. The range is always the same, from €0.20 to €100, and it's made up of 100 coins regardless of the selected value. However, coin values up to €1 can be bet.\n\nIo is a game with a vast play area and many ways to win and can compete with other Megaways slots. It's more than capable of providing substantial rewards, with the highest potential win of 5,000 times the bet or up to €500,000. However, with great rewards comes a higher risk of losing, so expect high volatility with this game. On the other hand, with an RTP set at 96%, you can trust that the game is not unfair, but it does come with higher stakes.\n\nCollect 3 Bonus Scatters to gain 7 free spins that can be redeemed. Now you can play on 8 rows at maximum or all 262,144 ways. The Charged or Wild Forge symbols will remain on the grid for the next free fall, but the Charged Wild will lose a life between games. You can win up to 5,000 times the bet before the bonus ends, or when you run out of free spins.\n\nIf you enjoyed Io, you may also like Elk Studio's other Cascading Reels slot game, Cygnus. Cygnus provides a gravity effect where the tiles are round and will roll to the lowest point.\n\nAs an experienced gambler, you know that Io is a space-themed slot game with impressive graphics, unique features, and several ways to win. So, try your luck and land those winning combinations with Io.\n            ",

It features falling symbols and Charged Wilds and offers a setup with 6 reels that can expand to give you up to 262,144 ways to win.\n\nHigh volatility and 6 reels with up to 262,144 ways to win\n\nIo is a high volatility game with a maximum payout of 5,000 times the bet. It begins with 6 reels and 4 rows of symbols where wins are formed by landing matching symbols on consecutive reels from the left to right. The game area can expand, doubling in size, and providing up to 262,144 ways to win.\n\nList of features including wild symbols, bonus symbols, Charged Wilds, Wild Forge and multipliers\n\nIo features wild symbols, bonus symbols, Charged Wilds, the Wild Forge with its multipliers, and other exciting features. The Charged Wilds symbols are the only ones that remain after the falling symbols activate at every win. With each new wave of symbols, the number of rows on the screen increases, providing more ways to win.\n\nRTP of 96% and maximum payout of 5,000 times the bet\n\nWith an RTP of 96%, Io is definitely worth a try. The game offers a high volatility and a maximum payout of 5,000 times the bet, with a chance of receiving up to €500,000.\n\nDetails of falling symbols and Charged Wilds\n\nThe falling symbols activate when involved symbols are removed and replaced with new symbols. The Charged Wilds symbols are the only ones that remain. With each new wave of symbols, the number of rows on the screen increases, providing more ways to win.\n\nFree spin mode with Wild Forge and Charged Wilds\n\nEnter the free spin mode by landing 3 Bonus scatters. This will grant you access to Free Spins where you can get the Wild Forge and Charged Wilds symbols. The Charged Wilds are wild symbols that come in 4 different variations and activate when part of a win, transforming into normal wilds on the fourth consecutive spin before disappearing. The Wild Forge adds a wild multiplier to empty spaces below it. Use the forge multiple times to increase the multiplier, and once it reaches the bottom, the symbol will transform into a multiplier wild. The laser is a feature that has laser rays from special symbols intersecting to transform all the touched positions into wild symbols.\n\nBetting range from €0.20 to €100 and coin values up to €1 can be bet\n\nElk Studios never seems to change the betting system in any of their games. The range is always the same, from €0.20 to €100, and it's made up of 100 coins regardless of the selected value. However, coin values up to €1 can be bet.\n\n        \n            ",

It offers a setup of 6 reels that can expand to give you up to 262,144 ways to win. Io features wild symbols, bonus symbols, Charged Wilds, and other exciting features. The Wild Forge with its multipliers and falling symbols that remove involved symbols and replace them with new symbols create more ways to win. The Charged Wilds symbols are the only ones that remain.\n\nWinning potential\n\nIo is a high volatility game and has a maximum payout of 5,000 times the bet or up to €500,000. The highest potential win is created by Collecting 3 Bonus Scatters to gain 7 free spins that can be redeemed. During this mode, the game area can expand, doubling in size, providing up to 262,144 ways to win. The Charged or Wild Forge symbols will remain on the grid for the next free fall, but the Charged Wild will lose a life between games.\n\nTheme and setting\n\nElk Studios rockets us back into space with Io, a space-themed slot game following in the footsteps of their previous game, Cygnus. The graphics of Io are attention-grabbing with fast and luminous features, strange sounds, and explosive animations. The background graphics suggest that the slot machine is set in space, and the game area is interesting to look at.\n\nRTP\n\nWith an RTP of 96%, Io is definitely worth a try. The 96% RTP is mostly aimed towards the free games that may take some time to trigger but are worth watching. If you’re lucky enough, you may even get a significant return on investment. \n\nBetting Range and Structure\n\nElk Studios never seems to change the betting system in any of their games. The range is always the same, from €0.20 to €100, and is made up of 100 coins regardless of the selected value. However, coin values up to €1 can be bet.\n\nElk Studios as developer\n\nElk Studios is a developer of online slot games with unique themes, graphics, and intriguing features. Some of their popular slot games include Lake's Five, Hit It Big, and Taco Brothers.\n\nRecommendation and target audience\n\nIo is a game with a vast play area and many ways to win and can compete with other Megaways slots. It's more than capable of providing substantial rewards; however, the game is high volatility, so expect higher risks. Io is recommended for experienced gamblers looking for unique features and high-stakes slots. If you enjoyed Io, you may also like Elk Studio's other Cascading Reels slot game, Cygnus.\n\n        \n            ",

Io is a high volatility game with a maximum payout of 5,000 times the bet. It offers a setup with 6 reels that can expand to give you up to 262,144 ways to win. Io also features wild symbols, bonus symbols, Charged Wilds, the Wild Forge with its multipliers, and other exciting features. With an RTP of 96%, Io is definitely worth a try.\n\nThe graphics of Io are attention-grabbing with fast and luminous features, strange sounds, and explosive animations. However, it may seem like you’re not winning much in the base game, unless you expand the grid to the maximum of 8 rows. The 96% RTP is mostly aimed towards the free games that may take some time to trigger but are worth watching. If you’re lucky enough, you may even get a significant return on investment. In the end, Io is just a variant of the games listed in the introduction, so the recipe for winning is fairly familiar. The choice of taking a trip to Io is entirely up to you, experienced gamblers.\n\nThe background graphics suggest that the slot machine is set in space and the game area is undoubtedly interesting to look at. However, you won’t find a list of futuristic-themed symbols here, instead, you’ll find the Bonus Planet, the Wild Logo, Lucky 7s, Diamonds, Clovers, Blue Stars, and four Poker card symbols.\n\nIo begins with 6 reels and 4 rows of symbols where wins are formed by landing matching symbols on consecutive reels from the left to right. The game area can expand, doubling in size, and providing up to 262,144 ways to win. The falling symbols activate at every win, as the involved symbols are removed and replaced with new symbols. The Charged Wilds symbols are the only ones that remain. With each new wave of symbols, the number of rows on the screen increases, providing more ways to win.\n\nThe game features wild symbols that are used when they land and are substituted for any other symbols within a payline to create a winning combination or make it better. You can also enter the free spin mode by landing 3 Bonus scatters. This will grant you access to Free Spins where you can get the Wild Forge and Charged Wilds symbols.\n\nThe Charged Wilds are wild symbols that come in 4 different variations. They activate when part of a win, transforming into normal wilds on the fourth consecutive spin before disappearing. The Wild Forge adds a wild multiplier to empty spaces below it. Use the forge multiple times to increase the multiplier, and once it reaches the bottom, the symbol will transform into a multiplier wild. The laser is a feature that has laser rays from special symbols intersecting to transform all the touched positions into wild symbols.\n\nElk Studios never seems to change the betting system in any of their games. The range is always the same, from €0.20 to €100, and it's made up of 100 coins regardless of the selected value. However, coin values up to €1 can be bet.\n\nIo is a game with a vast play area and many ways to win and can compete with other Megaways slots. It's more than capable of providing substantial rewards, with the highest potential win of 5,000 times the bet or up to €500,000. However, with great rewards comes a higher risk of losing, so expect high volatility with this game. On the other hand, with an RTP set at 96%, you can trust that the game is not unfair, but it does come with higher stakes.\n\nCollect 3 Bonus Scatters to gain 7 free spins that can be redeemed. Now you can play on 8 rows at maximum or all 262,144 ways. The Charged or Wild Forge symbols will remain on the grid for the next free fall, but the Charged Wild will lose a life between games. You can win up to 5,000 times the bet before the bonus ends, or when you run out of free spins.\n\nIf you enjoyed Io, you may also like Elk Studio's other Cascading Reels slot game, Cygnus. Cygnus provides a gravity effect where the tiles are round and will roll to the lowest point.\n\nAs an experienced gambler, you know that Io is a space-themed slot game with impressive graphics, unique features, and several ways to win. So, try your luck and land those winning combinations with Io.\n            ",

Io is a high volatility game with a maximum payout of 5,000 times the bet. It offers a setup with 6 reels that can expand to give you up to 262,144 ways to win. Io also features wild symbols, bonus symbols, Charged Wilds, the Wild Forge with its multipliers, and other exciting features. With an RTP of 96%, Io is definitely worth a try.\n\nThe graphics of Io are attention-grabbing with fast and luminous features, strange sounds, and explosive animations. However, it may seem like you’re not winning much in the base game, unless you expand the grid to the maximum of 8 rows. The 96% RTP is mostly aimed towards the free games that may take some time to trigger but are worth watching. If you’re lucky enough, you may even get a significant return on investment. In the end, Io is just a variant of the games listed in the introduction, so the recipe for winning is fairly familiar. The choice of taking a trip to Io is entirely up to you, experienced gamblers.\n\nThe background graphics suggest that the slot machine is set in space and the game area is undoubtedly interesting to look at. However, you won’t find a list of futuristic-themed symbols here, instead, you’ll find the Bonus Planet, the Wild Logo, Lucky 7s, Diamonds, Clovers, Blue Stars, and four Poker card symbols.\n\nIo begins with 6 reels and 4 rows of symbols where wins are formed by landing matching symbols on consecutive reels from the left to right. The game area can expand, doubling in size, and providing up to 262,144 ways to win. The falling symbols activate at every win, as the involved symbols are removed and replaced with new symbols. The Charged Wilds symbols are the only ones that remain. With each new wave of symbols, the number of rows on the screen increases, providing more ways to win.\n\nThe game features wild symbols that are used when they land and are substituted for any other symbols within a payline to create a winning combination or make it better. You can also enter the free spin mode by landing 3 Bonus scatters. This will grant you access to Free Spins where you can get the Wild Forge and Charged Wilds symbols.\n\nThe Charged Wilds are wild symbols that come in 4 different variations. They activate when part of a win, transforming into normal wilds on the fourth consecutive spin before disappearing. The Wild Forge adds a wild multiplier to empty spaces below it. Use the forge multiple times to increase the multiplier, and once it reaches the bottom, the symbol will transform into a multiplier wild. The laser is a feature that has laser rays from special symbols intersecting to transform all the touched positions into wild symbols.\n\nElk Studios never seems to change the betting system in any of their games. The range is always the same, from €0.20 to €100, and it's made up of 100 coins regardless of the selected value. However, coin values up to €1 can be bet.\n\nIo is a game with a vast play area and many ways to win and can compete with other Megaways slots. It's more than capable of providing substantial rewards, with the highest potential win of 5,000 times the bet or up to €500,000. However, with great rewards comes a higher risk of losing, so expect high volatility with this game. On the other hand, with an RTP set at 96%, you can trust that the game is not unfair, but it does come with higher stakes.\n\nCollect 3 Bonus Scatters to gain 7 free spins that can be redeemed. Now you can play on 8 rows at maximum or all 262,144 ways. The Charged or Wild Forge symbols will remain on the grid for the next free fall, but the Charged Wild will lose a life between games. You can win up to 5,000 times the bet before the bonus ends, or when you run out of free spins.\n\nIf you enjoyed Io, you may also like Elk Studio's other Cascading Reels slot game, Cygnus. Cygnus provides a gravity effect where the tiles are round and will roll to the lowest point.\n\nAs an experienced gambler, you know that Io is a space-themed slot game with impressive graphics, unique features, and several ways to win. So, try your luck and land those winning combinations with Io.\n            ",
