Gran parte del successo di questa slot è dovuta a due funzioni chiave: da un lato la Power Spins che ti presenta un moltiplicatore che arriva a 625x. Dall’altro invece ci sono i giri gratuiti che ti possono far vincere fino a 30.000 volte la tua scommessa. Il tutto con un RTP predefinito del 96,20%. Vediamo allora in che modo è stata resa elettrica l’intera atmosfera della macchinetta e che tipo di colpi di scena può offrire.\nLa grafica della slot Coils of Cash\nSotto l’aspetto del suo design Coils of Cash è puro spettacolo: si respira un’atmosfera realizzata in chiave retrò, curata nel minimo dettaglio, non solo attraverso lo sfondo, ma per ogni piccola meccanica. Ogni effetto è nitido e la resa è ideale non solo su display più grandi, ma anche su smartphone. Le bobine sono inserite perfettamente all’interno di un generatore elettrico dove si alternano i simboli che rendono vivace il gameplay. Partendo da quelli che hanno valore minore troviamo le carte da gioco classico e si associano poi alle vere chicche di questo tema che sono le apparecchiature elettriche arcane. L’immagine di una vecchia tv è il valore massimo: paga 1, 2, 3 o 5 volte la puntata se appare rispettivamente 3, 4, 5 o 6 icone. Ci sorprende nel complesso la scelta di abbinare l’aspetto più vintage di una macchinetta con la tecnologia di ultima generazione: una scelta azzardata forse, ma realizzata al meglio.\nFunzionalità speciali\nTra le migliori funzioni speciali non possiamo non citare la Cascading Reels: l’intera azione del gameplay si basa su un motore con bobine a cascata. Vuol dire che quando realizzi una combinazione vincente sulle bobine, i simboli spariscono per farne scendere altri nuovi e aumentare così le tue chance di vincita. Il processo continua fino a quando ci saranno ancora combo che pagano. Si affianca poi la Power Coil: nella parte superiore dei rulli da 2 a 5, c’è un altro rullo che si muove in orizzontale, ed è quello che alimenta il gioco. Qui si possono posizionare i jolly e sfruttare anche i moltiplicatori che renderanno sempre più succose le tue vincite, portandoti fino a 5x.\nE che slot sarebbe senza giri gratis? Se posizioni lo Scatter, ovvero la sfera di energia nel gioco 3 o più volte puoi andare a sbloccare questi spin aggiuntivi. Con 3 Scatter avrai 10 giri, con 4 si sale a 15, con 5 a 20 e infine con 6 Scatter si arriva a 25 giri. In questa fase, se si dovesse presentare sulla griglia un altro simbolo potrai aggiungere man mano 2 giri al conto totale.\nConsiderazioni finali su Coils of Cash\nLa slot è creata in modo superbo e anche se ha una struttura insolita ogni giocatore si troverà a proprio agio con tale meccanismo senza sentirsi spaesato. Coils of Cash ha funzionalità ben studiate, moltiplicatori importanti e trovate che nella loro semplicità riescono a lasciare un segno davvero piacevole.\n",

Play N Go has delivered once again, bringing us Coils of Cash - a 6x3 slot game with 2,304 ways to win. Impressive, right? This slot’s success can be attributed largely to two key features: Power Spins, which presents players with a potential 625x multiplier, and Free Spins, which can pay out up to 30,000 times your bet. And let’s not forget the impressive pre-set RTP of 96.20%. Let’s take a closer look at the electric atmosphere of this game and the surprises it holds.\n\nThe Graphics of Coils of Cash\n\nIn terms of design, Coils of Cash is pure spectacle. The retro atmosphere is expertly crafted in every detail, not just in the background, but in every aspect of the game mechanics. Every effect is sharp, and the presentation performs well on both larger displays and smartphones. The reels are perfectly placed inside an electric generator, on which symbols alternate and bring the game to life. Starting with lower-value symbols such as classic playing cards, players will soon discover the real gems of this theme - arcane electrical equipment. The highest-valued symbol is an old TV, paying out 1, 2, 3, or 5 times the bet amount for 3, 4, 5 or 6 icons, respectively.

This means that when a winning combination is achieved on the reels, the matching symbols disappear and new ones fall in to increase your chances of winning further. The process continues as long as there are paying combos. There is also the Power Coil, a horizontal reel above reels 2 through 5, that powers the game. Here, players can land wilds and take advantage of multipliers that make their winnings even juicier, up to 5x.\n\nAnd what’s a slot game without free spins? If you land the Scatter symbol (an energy sphere) on the reels 3 or more times, you can unlock additional spins. With 3 Scatters, you get 10 spins, 4 Scatters earn you 15, 5 Scatters land you 20, and an impressive 6 Scatters will get you 25.

The symbols, ranging from classic playing cards to vintage electrical equipment, add a lively energy to the game. The image of an old TV is the top symbol, paying out 1, 2, 3, or 5 times your bet if you land 3, 4, 5, or 6 on the reels, respectively.

Look no further than this special journey where energy reigns supreme in every sense. Play N Go has delivered once again, bringing us Coils of Cash - a 6x3 slot game with 2,304 ways to win. Impressive, right? This slot’s success can be attributed largely to two key features: Power Spins, which presents players with a potential 625x multiplier, and Free Spins, which can pay out up to 30,000 times your bet. And let’s not forget the impressive pre-set RTP of 96.20%. Let’s take a closer look at the electric atmosphere of this game and the surprises it holds.\n\nThe Graphics of Coils of Cash\n\nIn terms of design, Coils of Cash is pure spectacle. The retro atmosphere is expertly crafted in every detail, not just in the background, but in every aspect of the game mechanics. Every effect is sharp, and the presentation performs well on both larger displays and smartphones. The reels are perfectly placed inside an electric generator, on which symbols alternate and bring the game to life. Starting with lower-value symbols such as classic playing cards, players will soon discover the real gems of this theme - arcane electrical equipment. The highest-valued symbol is an old TV, paying out 1, 2, 3, or 5 times the bet amount for 3, 4, 5 or 6 icons, respectively.

Look no further than this special journey where energy reigns supreme in every sense. Play N Go has delivered once again, bringing us Coils of Cash - a 6x3 slot game with 2,304 ways to win. Impressive, right? This slot’s success can be attributed largely to two key features: Power Spins, which presents players with a potential 625x multiplier, and Free Spins, which can pay out up to 30,000 times your bet. And let’s not forget the impressive pre-set RTP of 96.20%. Let’s take a closer look at the electric atmosphere of this game and the surprises it holds.\n\nThe Graphics of Coils of Cash\n\nIn terms of design, Coils of Cash is pure spectacle. The retro atmosphere is expertly crafted in every detail, not just in the background, but in every aspect of the game mechanics.

Starting with lower-value symbols such as classic playing cards, players will soon discover the real gems of this theme - arcane electrical equipment. The highest-valued symbol is an old TV, paying out 1, 2, 3, or 5 times the bet amount for 3, 4, 5 or 6 icons, respectively. We are pleasantly surprised by the decision to combine the vintage look of a classic slot with the latest technology, and it is executed perfectly.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nOne of the best special features is undoubtedly the Cascading Reels, powering the entire gameplay with a cascading reel engine.

Here, players can land wilds and take advantage of multipliers that make their winnings even juicier, up to 5x.\n\nAnd what’s a slot game without free spins? If you land the Scatter symbol (an energy sphere) on the reels 3 or more times, you can unlock additional spins. With 3 Scatters, you get 10 spins, 4 Scatters earn you 15, 5 Scatters land you 20, and an impressive 6 Scatters will get you 25. During this phase, landing additional Scatter symbols grants an additional 2 spins for each.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Coils of Cash\n\nThis slot game is created immaculately.

Look no further than this special journey where energy reigns supreme in every sense. Play N Go has delivered once again, bringing us Coils of Cash - a 6x3 slot game with 2,304 ways to win. Impressive, right? This slot’s success can be attributed largely to two key features: Power Spins, which presents players with a potential 625x multiplier, and Free Spins, which can pay out up to 30,000 times your bet. And let’s not forget the impressive pre-set RTP of 96.20%. Let’s take a closer look at the electric atmosphere of this game and the surprises it holds.\n\nThe Graphics of Coils of Cash\n\nIn terms of design, Coils of Cash is pure spectacle. The retro atmosphere is expertly crafted in every detail, not just in the background, but in every aspect of the game mechanics. Every effect is sharp, and the presentation performs well on both larger displays and smartphones. The reels are perfectly placed inside an electric generator, on which symbols alternate and bring the game to life. Starting with lower-value symbols such as classic playing cards, players will soon discover the real gems of this theme - arcane electrical equipment. The highest-valued symbol is an old TV, paying out 1, 2, 3, or 5 times the bet amount for 3, 4, 5 or 6 icons, respectively. We are pleasantly surprised by the decision to combine the vintage look of a classic slot with the latest technology, and it is executed perfectly.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nOne of the best special features is undoubtedly the Cascading Reels, powering the entire gameplay with a cascading reel engine. This means that when a winning combination is achieved on the reels, the matching symbols disappear and new ones fall in to increase your chances of winning further. The process continues as long as there are paying combos. There is also the Power Coil, a horizontal reel above reels 2 through 5, that powers the game. Here, players can land wilds and take advantage of multipliers that make their winnings even juicier, up to 5x.\n\nAnd what’s a slot game without free spins? If you land the Scatter symbol (an energy sphere) on the reels 3 or more times, you can unlock additional spins. With 3 Scatters, you get 10 spins, 4 Scatters earn you 15, 5 Scatters land you 20, and an impressive 6 Scatters will get you 25. During this phase, landing additional Scatter symbols grants an additional 2 spins for each.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Coils of Cash\n\nThis slot game is created immaculately. Although it has an unusual structure, each player will feel comfortable with the mechanics, never feeling out of their depth. Coils of Cash offers meticulously designed features, significant multipliers, and simple but effective ideas that leave a lasting, pleasant impression. As an experienced gambler, don’t miss out on the chance to experience the energy of Coils of Cash for yourself!\n            ",
