    "original_text": "\nEggspendables\nDifficilmente ci è capitato di dover recensire una slot tanto divertente come Eggspendables, nuovo gioco prodotto dalla famosa software house Inspired.  Il nome si rifà al famoso film Expandables, che grazie alla fusione con il nome Eggs, uova, crea un contrasto niente male: delle feroci ma fragili uova che si ritrovano impegnate in una missione militare con destinazione Cambogia. A rendere più coinvolgente il gioco c’è anche una grafica ben dettagliata che riprende lo stile dei cartoni animati, corredata da alcune divertenti animazioni, soprattutto durante i giochi bonus che vedremo nel dettaglio più avanti. Lo sfondo su cui si muovono i rulli è una foresta lussureggiante davanti a uno specchio d’acqua, con una musica incalzante ricca d’azione. Sotto la griglia di gioco troviamo tutte le impostazioni per settare il gioco e i pulsanti per lo Start e per avviare i giri automatici.\nCaratteristiche di Eggspendables\nLa griglia di gioco è composta da 5 rulli e 4 linee, con una puntata minima totale di 0,20 €, quindi 0,01 € per ognuna delle 20 linee fisse che compongono il gioco. La puntata massima è invece di 200 € e vengono pagate le combinazioni vincenti da sinistra a destra. Eggspendables ha un buon RTP, pari al 96,8%. Infine, è possibile impostare tra 5 e 100 giri automatici, aggiungendo dei limiti di perdita o di vincita.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nRicca di Bonus che permettono di ottenere ottime vincite, in Eggspendables non sono presenti simboli legati al mondo delle carte da gioco, ma solo a tema con la slot. Quelli che pagano meno sono i baschi appartenenti al sergente, al luogotenente e al generale. A seguire in ordine di valore troviamo la bomba a mano, il bazooka, la polvere da sparo, l’elicottero e il carrarmato. Il simbolo che paga di più è il logo del gioco.\nDi tanto in tanto può comparire il simbolo misterioso, un missile che può assumere le sembianze di qualsiasi icona e che regala un giro gratuito.\nVediamo ora i bonus, il vero cuore di tutto il gioco. Sono 3 e dipendono dal tipo e dal numero di Eggs raccolti:\n\nDai 3 ai 5 simboli, accederai al gioco bonus più semplice. In pratica dovrai far girare un set di cucchiai, ognuno legato a un moltiplicatore. Il gioco finisce quando romperai l’uovo.\nDai 10 ai 14 simboli danno avvio al secondo gioco bonus: si gioca il bonus precedente ma quando si conclude si avranno 6 Respins nel gioco regolare. Il sergente diventa Wild, e ogni volta che compare sui rulli dà diritto a diversi giri gratuiti, oltre ad esplodere e a trasformare in Wild tutti i simboli adiacenti tranne quelli in diagonale.\nTra i 15 e i 20 simboli, si ha diritto a giocare il terzo bonus: la griglia si sposta sotto un aereo militare in volo con il portellone aperto. Ogni volta che sui rulli appare un soldato rosso, questi prenderà posto all’interno dell’aereo. Quando il sergente circondato dal fuoco fa la sua scomparsa sul rullo, allora i sergenti si lanceranno dall’aerei con il paracadute e trasformeranno i simboli regolari in uova fritte con funzione di Wild. Inoltre, simboli delle uova soldato premiano con un minimo di 5 fino a un massimo di 20 Free Spins.\n\n",

Produced by the renowned software house Inspired, Eggspendables is a fusion between the famous movie The Expendables and, you guessed it, eggs! The result is a thrilling mission to Cambodia, where fragile yet fierce eggs are the protagonists. The graphics, resembling a cartoon style, are rich in detail and accompanied by fun animations, especially during the bonus games, which we will discuss later. The background is a lush forest with a water mirror, and an action-packed soundtrack makes the whole experience even more engaging. \n\nThe game grid consists of 5 reels and 4 lines, with a total minimum bet of €0.20, or €0.01 per each of the 20 fixed betting lines. The maximum bet is €200, and winning combinations pay from left to right. Eggspendables boasts an excellent RTP of 96.8%, and players can set between 5 and 100 automatic spins and add winning or losing limits. \n\nAll symbols in Eggspendables are thematically related, and there are no card symbols. The lowest-paying symbols are soldiers' hats belonging to the sergeant, lieutenant, and general. Then, in order of value, we find a hand grenade, a bazooka, gunpowder, a helicopter, and a tank. The game logo is the symbol with the highest payout. From time to time, a mysterious symbol in the shape of a missile may appear; it can morph into any other icon and award a free spin.\n\nBut let's get to the heart of the game: the bonuses! There are three different bonuses depending on the number and type of eggs collected:\n\n- Collect 3 to 5 symbols to activate the simplest bonus game. You'll have to spin a set of spoons, each of them linked to a multiplier. The game ends when you break the egg.\n\n- Collect between 10 and 14 symbols to start the second bonus game. This is a continuation of the previous one, but then players can enjoy six respins during the regular game. The sergeant becomes a Wild, and every time he appears on the reels, he grants several free spins, explodes, and transforms adjacent symbols into Wilds, except for those in a diagonal position.\n\n- Collect between 15 and 20 symbols to play the third and most exciting bonus game. The grid moves beneath a military plane with an opened hatch. Every time a red soldier appears on the reels, he boards the aircraft. When the sergeant, surrounded by fire, vanishes from the reels, all the sergeants parachute from the plane and turn regular symbols into fried eggs with Wild functions. Additionally, egg soldier symbols award a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 20 free spins.\n\nOverall, Eggspendables is a must-play for every seasoned gambler out there!",

The name refers to the famous movie Expandables, which thanks to the fusion with the name Eggs, creates a nice contrast: fierce but fragile eggs that find themselves involved in a military mission with destination Cambodia. The game is made even more engaging by a well-detailed graphics that takes up the style of cartoons, accompanied by some fun animations, especially during the bonus games that we will see in more detail later. The background on which the reels move is a lush forest in front of a body of water, with a lively and action-rich music. Under the game grid, we find all the settings to set up the game and the buttons to start and initiate automatic spins.\nFeatures of Eggspendables\nThe game grid consists of 5 reels and 4 rows, with a minimum total bet of € 0.20, therefore € 0.01 for each of the 20 fixed lines that make up the game. The maximum bet is instead € 200 and winning combinations are paid from left to right. Eggspendables has a good RTP, equal to 96.8%. Finally, it is possible to set between 5 and 100 automatic spins, adding loss or win limits.\nSymbols and features\nRich in bonuses that allow for excellent winnings, Eggspendables does not have symbols related to the world of playing cards, but only those related to the theme of the slot. Those that pay the least are the hats belonging to the sergeant, lieutenant, and general. Following in order of value, we find the hand grenade, bazooka, gunpowder, helicopter, and tank. The symbol that pays the most is the game logo.\nFrom time to time, the mysterious symbol can appear, a missile that can take on the appearance of any icon and that gives a free spin.\nNow let's see the bonuses, the real heart of the game. There are 3 of them and depend on the type and the number of Eggs collected:\n\nFrom 3 to 5 symbols, you will access the simplest bonus game. In practice, you will have to spin a set of spoons, each one linked to a multiplier. The game ends when you break the egg.\nFrom 10 to 14 symbols start the second bonus game: you play the previous bonus but when it ends you will have 6 respins in the regular game. The sergeant becomes wild, and every time he appears on the reels, he is entitled to different free spins, as well as exploding and transforming all adjacent symbols into wilds except those diagonally.\nBetween 15 and 20 symbols, you are entitled to play the third bonus game: the grid moves under a military aircraft in flight with the hatch open. Every time a red soldier appears on the reels, he will take his place inside the plane. When the sergeant surrounded by fire disappears on the reel, the sergeants will jump from the plane with the parachute and transform the regular symbols into fried eggs with wild function. In addition, soldier egg symbols reward with a minimum of 5 up to a maximum of 20 free spins.\n            ",

The name refers to the famous movie Expandables, which thanks to the fusion with the name Eggs, creates a nice contrast: fierce but fragile eggs that find themselves involved in a military mission with destination Cambodia. The game is made even more engaging by a well-detailed graphics that takes up the style of cartoons, accompanied by some fun animations, especially during the bonus games that we will see in more detail later. The background on which the reels move is a lush forest in front of a body of water, with a lively and action-rich music. Under the game grid, we find all the settings to set up the game and the buttons to start and initiate automatic spins.\nFeatures of Eggspendables\nThe game grid consists of 5 reels and 4 rows, with a minimum total bet of € 0.20, therefore € 0.01 for each of the 20 fixed lines that make up the game. The maximum bet is instead € 200 and winning combinations are paid from left to right. Eggspendables has a good RTP, equal to 96.8%. Finally, it is possible to set between 5 and 100 automatic spins, adding loss or win limits.\nSymbols and features\nRich in bonuses that allow for excellent winnings, Eggspendables does not have symbols related to the world of playing cards, but only those related to the theme of the slot. Those that pay the least are the hats belonging to the sergeant, lieutenant, and general. Following in order of value, we find the hand grenade, bazooka, gunpowder, helicopter, and tank. The symbol that pays the most is the game logo.\nFrom time to time, the mysterious symbol can appear, a missile that can take on the appearance of any icon and that gives a free spin.\nNow let's see the bonuses, the real heart of the game. There are 3 of them and depend on the type and the number of Eggs collected:\n\nFrom 3 to 5 symbols, you will access the simplest bonus game. In practice, you will have to spin a set of spoons, each one linked to a multiplier. The game ends when you break the egg.\nFrom 10 to 14 symbols start the second bonus game: you play the previous bonus but when it ends you will have 6 respins in the regular game. The sergeant becomes wild, and every time he appears on the reels, he is entitled to different free spins, as well as exploding and transforming all adjacent symbols into wilds except those diagonally.\nBetween 15 and 20 symbols, you are entitled to play the third bonus game: the grid moves under a military aircraft in flight with the hatch open. Every time a red soldier appears on the reels, he will take his place inside the plane. When the sergeant surrounded by fire disappears on the reel, the sergeants will jump from the plane with the parachute and transform the regular symbols into fried eggs with wild function. In addition, soldier egg symbols reward with a minimum of 5 up to a maximum of 20 free spins.\n            ",

The name refers to the famous movie Expandables, which thanks to the fusion with the name Eggs, creates a nice contrast: fierce but fragile eggs that find themselves involved in a military mission with destination Cambodia. The game is made even more engaging by a well-detailed graphics that takes up the style of cartoons, accompanied by some fun animations, especially during the bonus games that we will see in more detail later. The background on which the reels move is a lush forest in front of a body of water, with a lively and action-rich music. Under the game grid, we find all the settings to set up the game and the buttons to start and initiate automatic spins.\nFeatures of Eggspendables\nThe game grid consists of 5 reels and 4 rows, with a minimum total bet of € 0.20, therefore € 0.01 for each of the 20 fixed lines that make up the game. The maximum bet is instead € 200 and winning combinations are paid from left to right. Eggspendables has a good RTP, equal to 96.8%. Finally, it is possible to set between 5 and 100 automatic spins, adding loss or win limits.\nSymbols and features\nRich in bonuses that allow for excellent winnings, Eggspendables does not have symbols related to the world of playing cards, but only those related to the theme of the slot. Those that pay the least are the hats belonging to the sergeant, lieutenant, and general. Following in order of value, we find the hand grenade, bazooka, gunpowder, helicopter, and tank. The symbol that pays the most is the game logo.\nFrom time to time, the mysterious symbol can appear, a missile that can take on the appearance of any icon and that gives a free spin.\nNow let's see the bonuses, the real heart of the game. There are 3 of them and depend on the type and the number of Eggs collected:\n\nFrom 3 to 5 symbols, you will access the simplest bonus game. In practice, you will have to spin a set of spoons, each one linked to a multiplier. The game ends when you break the egg.\nFrom 10 to 14 symbols start the second bonus game: you play the previous bonus but when it ends you will have 6 respins in the regular game. The sergeant becomes wild, and every time he appears on the reels, he is entitled to different free spins, as well as exploding and transforming all adjacent symbols into wilds except those diagonally.\nBetween 15 and 20 symbols, you are entitled to play the third bonus game: the grid moves under a military aircraft in flight with the hatch open. Every time a red soldier appears on the reels, he will take his place inside the plane. When the sergeant surrounded by fire disappears on the reel, the sergeants will jump from the plane with the parachute and transform the regular symbols into fried eggs with wild function. In addition, soldier egg symbols reward with a minimum of 5 up to a maximum of 20 free spins.\n            ",
