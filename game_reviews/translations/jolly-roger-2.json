Questo simbolo divenuto universale racconta la storia affascinante di uomini, spesso ex corsari, che si ribellano al sistema e cominciano a solcare i mari Caraibici per saccheggiare galeoni e navi commerciali.\nEntrando nel dettaglio della slot, cominciamo subito col dire che la grafica è spettacolare, come da tradizione delle slot targate Play’N’Go Go. La griglia di gioco si staglia sulla prua di una nave pirata, da cui possiamo ammirare il mare caraibico sormontato da altre navi pirata.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay and Features\nGraphics and Sound Design\nPaylines and Betting Options\nBonus Quest Feature\nWinning Potential and RTP\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Jolly Roger 2\n\nPlay'n'Go returns with Jolly Roger 2, the second chapter of the pirate-themed slot machines, featuring ruthless pirates and galleons full of gold and precious stones!\n\nTheme and graphics\n\nThe term Jolly Roger refers to the famous flag with a skull and crossbones that distinguished pirate ships. This universal symbol tells the fascinating story of men, often former corsairs, who rebel against the system and begin to sail the Caribbean seas to loot galleons and merchant ships.\n\nGetting into the details of the slot, let's start by saying that the graphics are spectacular, as is tradition for Play'n'Go slot machines. The game grid stands out on the bow of a pirate ship, from which we can admire the Caribbean sea topped by other pirate ships. Above the frame is the word Jolly Roger, with the words divided by a compass, which is not a coincidence but has an important role during the game. The epic and exciting music broken by the sound of waves and the singing of seagulls is the typical one that accompanies famous films inspired by the exploits of pirates.\n\nSlot features\n\nThe grid has a classic cut, with 5 reels and 3 rows. In Jolly Roger 2, we have 20 fixed pay lines on which you can bet from €0.20 up to €100. The maximum potential win is a whopping 5,000 times the bet! With medium volatility, this slot has an RTP of 96%. It is possible to set between 10 and 100 automatic spins, including some limits that the game interrupts.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nLet's start by saying that during the game, the Compass feature can be randomly activated: the compass above gives a multiplier ranging from 2x to 10x. As for the regular game prizes, the symbols that pay the least are those linked to the playing cards, from 10 to Ace. Next, we have the skull ring, the golden cross, diamonds, and the treasure chest. The Wild symbol is Jolly Rogers, the skull with crossed bones, and it replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by the pirate. Three of these symbols activate the Bonus Quest Feature function: on the screen, we will see scrolls appear that, once unrolled, will give us the opportunity to face one of the three bonus games. Let's see in detail the characteristics of each special level:\n\nInstant Prize: from the chest that appears in the center of the screen, a random prize between x2 and x10 or a repayment of x15 or x20 the total bet will be awarded. During this function, the Compass function can also be activated.\nBottle of Rum Free Spins: it starts with a free spin, then we will see rum bottles appear at the base of the reels. By clicking on 2 of them, the corresponding entire reels will be covered in Wild.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay Features\nGraphics and Sound Design\nBonuses and Free Spins\nVolatility and RTP\nSymbol Design\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Jolly Roger 2\n\nPlay'n'Go returns with Jolly Roger 2, the second chapter of the pirate-themed slot machines, featuring ruthless pirates and galleons full of gold and precious stones!\n\nTheme and graphics\n\nThe term Jolly Roger refers to the famous flag with a skull and crossbones that distinguished pirate ships. This universal symbol tells the fascinating story of men, often former corsairs, who rebel against the system and begin to sail the Caribbean seas to loot galleons and merchant ships.\n\nGetting into the details of the slot, let's start by saying that the graphics are spectacular, as is tradition for Play'n'Go slot machines. The game grid stands out on the bow of a pirate ship, from which we can admire the Caribbean sea topped by other pirate ships. Above the frame is the word Jolly Roger, with the words divided by a compass, which is not a coincidence but has an important role during the game. The epic and exciting music broken by the sound of waves and the singing of seagulls is the typical one that accompanies famous films inspired by the exploits of pirates.\n\nSlot features\n\nThe grid has a classic cut, with 5 reels and 3 rows. In Jolly Roger 2, we have 20 fixed pay lines on which you can bet from €0.20 up to €100. The maximum potential win is a whopping 5,000 times the bet! With medium volatility, this slot has an RTP of 96%. It is possible to set between 10 and 100 automatic spins, including some limits that the game interrupts.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nLet's start by saying that during the game, the Compass feature can be randomly activated: the compass above gives a multiplier ranging from 2x to 10x. As for the regular game prizes, the symbols that pay the least are those linked to the playing cards, from 10 to Ace. Next, we have the skull ring, the golden cross, diamonds, and the treasure chest. The Wild symbol is Jolly Rogers, the skull with crossed bones, and it replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by the pirate. Three of these symbols activate the Bonus Quest Feature function: on the screen, we will see scrolls appear that, once unrolled, will give us the opportunity to face one of the three bonus games. Let's see in detail the characteristics of each special level:\n\nInstant Prize: from the chest that appears in the center of the screen, a random prize between x2 and x10 or a repayment of x15 or x20 the total bet will be awarded. During this function, the Compass function can also be activated.\nBottle of Rum Free Spins: it starts with a free spin, then we will see rum bottles appear at the base of the reels. By clicking on 2 of them, the corresponding entire reels will be covered in Wild. Even in this case, the Compass function could be activated.\nBattle Free Spins: in this case, it will be necessary to defeat the Portuguese, English, and Dutch galleons to obtain a reward and a Compass Multiplier\nTreasure Hunt: with this Bonus, you are entitled to 10 Free Spins. The aim is to collect at least 4 maps to discover the buried treasure. In addition, a random symbol will become Wild, and you will be entitled to a Compass Multiplier. Once the treasure is found, you will be rewarded with additional Free Spins.\n\nAs experienced gamblers, you will appreciate the wide range of features and the potential for big wins in Jolly Roger 2. The theme and graphics are well-executed, and the addition of the Compass multiplier adds to the excitement of the game. Don't miss the chance to join the pirate crew and take home the treasure!\n            ",

This universal symbol tells the fascinating story of men, often former corsairs, who rebel against the system and begin to sail the Caribbean seas to loot galleons and merchant ships.\n\nGetting into the details of the slot, let's start by saying that the graphics are spectacular, as is tradition for Play'n'Go slot machines. The game grid stands out on the bow of a pirate ship, from which we can admire the Caribbean sea topped by other pirate ships. Above the frame is the word Jolly Roger, with the words divided by a compass, which is not a coincidence but has an important role during the game. The epic and exciting music broken by the sound of waves and the singing of seagulls is the typical one that accompanies famous films inspired by the exploits of pirates.\n\nSlot features\n\nThe grid has a classic cut, with 5 reels and 3 rows. In Jolly Roger 2, we have 20 fixed pay lines on which you can bet from €0.20 up to €100. The maximum potential win is a whopping 5,000 times the bet! With medium volatility, this slot has an RTP of 96%. It is possible to set between 10 and 100 automatic spins, including some limits that the game interrupts.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nLet's start by saying that during the game, the Compass feature can be randomly activated: the compass above gives a multiplier ranging from 2x to 10x. As for the regular game prizes, the symbols that pay the least are those linked to the playing cards, from 10 to Ace. Next, we have the skull ring, the golden cross, diamonds, and the treasure chest. The Wild symbol is Jolly Rogers, the skull with crossed bones, and it replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by the pirate. Three of these symbols activate the Bonus Quest Feature function: on the screen, we will see scrolls appear that, once unrolled, will give us the opportunity to face one of the three bonus games. Let's see in detail the characteristics of each special level:\n\nInstant Prize: from the chest that appears in the center of the screen, a random prize between x2 and x10 or a repayment of x15 or x20 the total bet will be awarded. During this function, the Compass function can also be activated.\nBottle of Rum Free Spins: it starts with a free spin, then we will see rum bottles appear at the base of the reels. By clicking on 2 of them, the corresponding entire reels will be covered in Wild. Even in this case, the Compass function could be activated.\nBattle Free Spins: in this case, it will be necessary to defeat the Portuguese, English, and Dutch galleons to obtain a reward and a Compass Multiplier\nTreasure Hunt: with this Bonus, you are entitled to 10 Free Spins. The aim is to collect at least 4 maps to discover the buried treasure. In addition, a random symbol will become Wild, and you will be entitled to a Compass Multiplier. Once the treasure is found, you will be rewarded with additional Free Spins.\n\nAs experienced gamblers, you will appreciate the wide range of features and the potential for big wins in Jolly Roger 2. The theme and graphics are well-executed, and the addition of the Compass multiplier adds to the excitement of the game. Don't miss the chance to join the pirate crew and take home the treasure!\n            ",

This universal symbol tells the fascinating story of men, often former corsairs, who rebel against the system and begin to sail the Caribbean seas to loot galleons and merchant ships.\n\nGetting into the details of the slot, let's start by saying that the graphics are spectacular, as is tradition for Play'n'Go slot machines. The game grid stands out on the bow of a pirate ship, from which we can admire the Caribbean sea topped by other pirate ships. Above the frame is the word Jolly Roger, with the words divided by a compass, which is not a coincidence but has an important role during the game. The epic and exciting music broken by the sound of waves and the singing of seagulls is the typical one that accompanies famous films inspired by the exploits of pirates.\n\nSlot features\n\nThe grid has a classic cut, with 5 reels and 3 rows. In Jolly Roger 2, we have 20 fixed pay lines on which you can bet from €0.20 up to €100. The maximum potential win is a whopping 5,000 times the bet! With medium volatility, this slot has an RTP of 96%. It is possible to set between 10 and 100 automatic spins, including some limits that the game interrupts.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nLet's start by saying that during the game, the Compass feature can be randomly activated: the compass above gives a multiplier ranging from 2x to 10x. As for the regular game prizes, the symbols that pay the least are those linked to the playing cards, from 10 to Ace. Next, we have the skull ring, the golden cross, diamonds, and the treasure chest. The Wild symbol is Jolly Rogers, the skull with crossed bones, and it replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by the pirate. Three of these symbols activate the Bonus Quest Feature function: on the screen, we will see scrolls appear that, once unrolled, will give us the opportunity to face one of the three bonus games. Let's see in detail the characteristics of each special level:\n\nInstant Prize: from the chest that appears in the center of the screen, a random prize between x2 and x10 or a repayment of x15 or x20 the total bet will be awarded. During this function, the Compass function can also be activated.\nBottle of Rum Free Spins: it starts with a free spin, then we will see rum bottles appear at the base of the reels. By clicking on 2 of them, the corresponding entire reels will be covered in Wild. Even in this case, the Compass function could be activated.\nBattle Free Spins: in this case, it will be necessary to defeat the Portuguese, English, and Dutch galleons to obtain a reward and a Compass Multiplier\nTreasure Hunt: with this Bonus, you are entitled to 10 Free Spins. The aim is to collect at least 4 maps to discover the buried treasure. In addition, a random symbol will become Wild, and you will be entitled to a Compass Multiplier. Once the treasure is found, you will be rewarded with additional Free Spins.\n\nAs experienced gamblers, you will appreciate the wide range of features and the potential for big wins in Jolly Roger 2. The theme and graphics are well-executed, and the addition of the Compass multiplier adds to the excitement of the game. Don't miss the chance to join the pirate crew and take home the treasure!\n            ",
