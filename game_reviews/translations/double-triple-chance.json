It has a traditional fruit machine theme with an added modern twist that makes the gameplay dynamic and exciting. The game is designed for players who enjoy classic slots but want to experience something new. It is easy to play and does not require any downloads.\n\nBetting Options\n\nPlayers can set their bets between €0.05 and €10.00 per line in Double Triple Chance. This feature gives players more control over their bets, allowing them to play within their budget. The slot also has a gambling feature that lets players increase their winnings after a successful spin by playing the ladder or card game.\n\nBonus Features\n\nDouble Triple Chance has an exciting bonus feature called Bonus Rewin. This feature is activated when all the positions on the reels are filled with the same game icons. A wheel then appears on the screen, and players can spin it to win prizes. The Bonus Rewin feature ends when the traffic light returns to the red sector or if the player wins six times in a row. This bonus feature adds excitement and increases the chances of winning big.\n\nSymbols\n\nDouble Triple Chance has a classic fruit machine theme, and the symbols used in the game reflect this. The symbols include oranges, plums, cherries, grapes, balls, a 7 card, and the Merkur logo. The fruits are beautifully designed and look fresh and delicious. The traditional symbols are familiar to many players and add to the overall appeal of the game.\n\nScatter Symbol\n\nUnfortunately, there is no Scatter symbol in Double Triple Chance. This can be a disappointment for some players, as Scatter symbols are usually associated with bonuses and can increase the chances of winning. However, the absence of a Scatter symbol does not detract from the excitement and potential rewards of the game. \n\n        \n            ",
