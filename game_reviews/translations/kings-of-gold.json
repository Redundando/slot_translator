As part of their Hold & Win series, this game features all the classic features and graphics you'd expect from such a release. Although it doesn't offer many original features, it's still a great way to pass some time for those looking to win big.\n\nKings of Gold doesn't do anything particularly impressive, and in many ways, it's a fairly average release. It starts with the standard 5 reels and 25 lines setup and offers medium rewards up to 1,121x the bet, a below-average RTP of 95.14%, and a mix of features. These include the Hold & Win bonus game, free spins, scatters, and stacked wilds.\n\nAs the latest developer to take players on a journey to the land of the Pharaohs, iSoftBet's Kings of Gold is a 5 reel, 25 payline game that comes with a couple of classic features. The Pharaoh's Gold Respins feature is a strip spin where collecting coins can lead to great rewards. There's also a free spins feature with synchronized reels. Boasting superb graphics and spine-tingling music, this game is sure to impress.\n\nKings of Gold's design is opulent and luxurious, fitting for its name. With an ancient Egyptian theme, the background features the deserts of Arabia, a traveler on a camel, an oasis, palms, and the mighty pyramids. Accompanying the action is a classic Arabic soundtrack that's captivating and perfectly suited to the theme. The design is bright, bold, and easy on the eyes, with black reels bordered in gold.\n\nPlayers will find super shiny royals from A to J, as well as four ornate Egyptian jewels. These include an ankh cross, the cat god Bastet, and the scarab. The most rewarding symbol is the treasure chest full of gold. Landing 5 of these on a payline will earn you a prize equal to 16x your total bet.\n\nThe Pharaoh symbol is the Wild symbol. Wild symbols appear stacked and can substitute for any other symbols except for bonus and gold coin symbols.\n\nKings of Gold is available to play on all devices, including PC, tablet, and mobile. Clear images are essential when using a mobile device, and Kings of Gold's mobile slot game stands out. The gameplay is simple and suitable for playing on a small screen, and it works great.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nKings of Gold uses 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 fixed paylines. A win is created in the usual way, by landing 3 or more matching symbols from left to right on a payline starting from reel 1.\n\nPlayers can start their Saharan adventure with bets ranging from 25 cents to 25 euros per spin. Simply click on the coin symbol to the right of the reels and adjust accordingly. Above the main spin button is the autoplay tab. Click this and set between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins. There are also options for win and loss limits if necessary. Click the lightning bolt in the lower-left corner of the screen to activate turbo spin mode.\n\nKings of Gold's RTP rate is a little slim at 95.14%. The most you can win from a single spin is 1,121x your total bet.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the stacked wild symbol based on the image of the Pharaoh. It can cover full reels, which works well, but it doesn't apply to other feature symbols, which must activate their features themselves.\n\nThe Hold & Win feature is one that iSoftBet has been focusing on lately, and we're seeing it used in Kings of Gold as well. It requires the presence of special bonus symbols in 5 or more positions. These would be the Gold Coins, symbols that are also used during the Respins that follow.\n\nOnly empty spaces, Pharaohs, and Gold Coins can appear during the 3 Respins assigned here. But as more Gold Coins appear, the number of Respins decreases. All Gold Coins have values on them and are sticky. The feature ends when Respins run out or all 15 positions have gold coins stuck on them. If a Pharaoh symbol appears, it collects the Gold Coins in view, and you can start over with new rewards.\n\nAnother common feature, which we also receive from the Reels of Gold, is free spins. This time, the triggering symbol is the Pyramid, another scatter. Only three reels can get these symbols, and all must be visible so that the 8 free spins of the slot can begin.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nTake a journey back to ancient Egypt with another slot based on this popular theme. We present Pharaoh's Fortune, the 5-reel, 15-payline game from IGT.

Come al solito, questo non vale per gli altri simboli delle caratteristiche, che devono attivare le loro caratteristiche da soli.\nLa funzione Hold & Win è una di quelle che iSoftBet si è impegnata a fondo ultimamente, e la stiamo vedendo utilizzata anche in Kings of Gold. Richiederà la presenza di speciali simboli bonus in 5 o più posizioni. Queste sarebbero le Monete d’Oro, simboli che si usano anche durante i Respins che seguono.\nSolo gli spazi vuoti, i Faraoni e le Monete d’Oro possono apparire durante i 3 Respin qui assegnati, ma man mano che appaiono più Monete, il numero di Respin si azzera. Tutte le Monete d’Oro hanno dei valori su di esse, e sono appiccicose. La funzione termina quando si esauriscono i respins, o quando tutte e 15 le posizioni hanno monete d’oro appiccicose su di esse. Se appare un simbolo del Faraone, raccoglie le Monete d’Oro in vista, e si può ricominciare da capo con nuovi premi.\nUn’altra caratteristica comune, che riceviamo anche dai Re dell’Oro, sono i giri gratis. Questa volta, il simbolo scatenante è la Piramide, un altro spargimento. Solo tre bobine possono ottenere questi simboli, e tutte devono essere visibili, in modo che le 8 rotazioni libere della slot possano iniziare.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nViaggio di ritorno nell’antico Egitto per un’altra slot basata su questo tema popolare. Vi presentiamo Pharaoh’s Fortune, il gioco a cinque rulli, 15 payline di IGT. I giochi di slot a tema egiziano non sono mai difficili da trovare e Pharaoh’s Fortune è uno dei software che fornisce le aggiunte dei giganti IGT a questa categoria.\n\n        ",

While the graphics and features are fairly standard for such a theme, it may still prove to be a decent way to pass the time for experienced gamblers.\nKings of Gold does not offer many innovations or impressive features. It starts with the standard setup of 5 reels and 25 paylines, with rewards up to 1,121x the bet, an RTP below average at 95.14%, and a mix of features, including the Hold & Win bonus game, free spins, scatters, and stacked wilds.\niSoftBet is the latest developer to take slot players on a journey to the land of the Pharaohs with Kings of Gold. This Egyptian trek is played on a 5-reel, 25-payline game engine and comes with a couple of classic features. The Pharaoh's Gold Respins feature is a strip spin where collecting coins can yield big rewards. There is also a free spins feature with synchronized reels. With superb graphics and a chilling soundtrack, learn more in our in-depth review of Kings of Gold.\nA Regal Design\nKings of Gold's design looks luxurious and opulent, as expected from its name. With an Ancient Egyptian theme, the background features the deserts of Arabia, a traveler on a camel, an oasis, palms, and imposing pyramids. The classic Arabic soundtrack fits perfectly with the theme.\nThe design is bright, bold, and straightforward on the senses, with reels surrounded by a gold border. Glossy royals from A to J and four decorated Egyptian jewels decorate the game. They include an Ankh cross, the cat goddess Bastet, and the scarab. The most rewarding symbol is the treasure chest full of gold. Land 5 of these on a payline and receive a prize equal to 16x your total bet. The Pharaoh symbol is the wild symbol. Wild symbols appear stacked and can replace any other symbol except for the scatter and gold coin symbols.\nKings of Gold is available to play on all devices, including PC, tablets, and mobiles. Clear images are crucial on portable devices, and Kings of Gold's mobile slot shines bright. The simple gameplay is suitable for small screens, and it runs smoothly.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nKings of Gold uses 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 fixed paylines. Wins are created in the usual way by landing 3 or more matching symbols from left to right on a payline, starting from reel 1.\nYou can start your Saharan adventure with bets ranging from 25 cents to 25 euros per spin. Click on the coin symbol to the right of the reels and adjust accordingly. Above the main spin button is the autoplay tab, where you can set between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins. There are also options for win and loss limits if necessary. Click on the lightning bolt in the lower-left corner of the screen to activate turbo spin mode.\nKings of Gold's RTP rate is a rather modest 95.14%. The maximum you can win from a single spin is 1,121x your total bet.\nFirst, let's take a look at the stacked wild symbol based on the image of the Pharaoh. It can cover full reels, which works well. As usual, this does not apply to other feature symbols, which must trigger their features individually.\nThe Hold & Win feature is one that iSoftBet has committed to lately, and we are seeing it in action in Kings of Gold. It requires the presence of special bonus symbols in 5 or more positions. These are the Gold Coins, symbols that are also used during the ensuing respins.\nOnly empty spaces, Pharaohs, and Gold Coins can appear during the 3 respins awarded here, but as more Coins appear, the number of respins dwindles. All Gold Coins have values on them, and they are sticky. The feature ends when respins run out or when all 15 positions have sticky Gold Coins on them. If a Pharaoh symbol appears, it collects the visible Gold Coins, and the feature can start anew with new rewards.\nAnother common feature that we also receive from the Kings of Gold is free spins. This time, the triggering symbol is the Pyramid, another scatter. Only three reels can get these symbols, and all must be visible, so the slot's 8 free spins can begin.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAnother slot based on this popular theme takes us back to Ancient Egypt. We present Pharaoh's Fortune, a 5-reel, 15-payline game by IGT. Egyptian-themed slot games are never hard to find, and Pharaoh's Fortune is one of the software giant IGT's additions to this category."

As part of their Hold & Win series, this game features all the classic features and graphics you'd expect from such a release. Although it doesn't offer many original features, it's still a great way to pass some time for those looking to win big.\n\nKings of Gold doesn't do anything particularly impressive, and in many ways, it's a fairly average release. It starts with the standard 5 reels and 25 lines setup and offers medium rewards up to 1,121x the bet, a below-average RTP of 95.14%, and a mix of features. These include the Hold & Win bonus game, free spins, scatters, and stacked wilds.\n\nAs the latest developer to take players on a journey to the land of the Pharaohs, iSoftBet's Kings of Gold is a 5 reel, 25 payline game that comes with a couple of classic features. The Pharaoh's Gold Respins feature is a strip spin where collecting coins can lead to great rewards. There's also a free spins feature with synchronized reels. Boasting superb graphics and spine-tingling music, this game is sure to impress.\n\nKings of Gold's design is opulent and luxurious, fitting for its name. With an ancient Egyptian theme, the background features the deserts of Arabia, a traveler on a camel, an oasis, palms, and the mighty pyramids. Accompanying the action is a classic Arabic soundtrack that's captivating and perfectly suited to the theme. The design is bright, bold, and easy on the eyes, with black reels bordered in gold.\n\nPlayers will find super shiny royals from A to J, as well as four ornate Egyptian jewels. These include an ankh cross, the cat god Bastet, and the scarab. The most rewarding symbol is the treasure chest full of gold. Landing 5 of these on a payline will earn you a prize equal to 16x your total bet.\n\nThe Pharaoh symbol is the Wild symbol. Wild symbols appear stacked and can substitute for any other symbols except for bonus and gold coin symbols.\n\nKings of Gold is available to play on all devices, including PC, tablet, and mobile. Clear images are essential when using a mobile device, and Kings of Gold's mobile slot game stands out. The gameplay is simple and suitable for playing on a small screen, and it works great.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nKings of Gold uses 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 fixed paylines. A win is created in the usual way, by landing 3 or more matching symbols from left to right on a payline starting from reel 1.\n\nPlayers can start their Saharan adventure with bets ranging from 25 cents to 25 euros per spin. Simply click on the coin symbol to the right of the reels and adjust accordingly. Above the main spin button is the autoplay tab. Click this and set between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins. There are also options for win and loss limits if necessary. Click the lightning bolt in the lower-left corner of the screen to activate turbo spin mode.\n\nKings of Gold's RTP rate is a little slim at 95.14%. The most you can win from a single spin is 1,121x your total bet.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the stacked wild symbol based on the image of the Pharaoh. It can cover full reels, which works well, but it doesn't apply to other feature symbols, which must activate their features themselves.\n\nThe Hold & Win feature is one that iSoftBet has been focusing on lately, and we're seeing it used in Kings of Gold as well. It requires the presence of special bonus symbols in 5 or more positions. These would be the Gold Coins, symbols that are also used during the Respins that follow.\n\nOnly empty spaces, Pharaohs, and Gold Coins can appear during the 3 Respins assigned here. But as more Gold Coins appear, the number of Respins decreases. All Gold Coins have values on them and are sticky. The feature ends when Respins run out or all 15 positions have gold coins stuck on them. If a Pharaoh symbol appears, it collects the Gold Coins in view, and you can start over with new rewards.\n\nAnother common feature, which we also receive from the Reels of Gold, is free spins. This time, the triggering symbol is the Pyramid, another scatter. Only three reels can get these symbols, and all must be visible so that the 8 free spins of the slot can begin.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nTake a journey back to ancient Egypt with another slot based on this popular theme. We present Pharaoh's Fortune, the 5-reel, 15-payline game from IGT. Egyptian-themed slot games are never hard to find, and Pharaoh's Fortune is one of the software additions from giants IGT in this category.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay features\n\nKings of Gold offers classic features such as medium rewards up to 1,121x the bet, a below-average RTP of 95.14%, a 5 reel, 25 payline game, the Hold & Win bonus game, free spins, scatters, and stacked wilds. The Hold & Win feature requires the presence of special bonus symbols in 5 or more positions. These would be the Gold Coins, symbols that are also used during the Respins that follow. When the Respin feature is triggered, only empty spaces, Pharaohs, and Gold Coins can appear. But as more Gold Coins appear, the number of Respins decreases. All Gold Coins have values on them and are sticky. The feature ends when Respins run out, or all 15 positions have gold coins stuck on them. If a Pharaoh symbol appears, it collects the Gold Coins in view, and you can start over with new rewards. The free spins feature is triggered by the Pyramid scatter, and only three reels can get these symbols, and all must be visible so that the 8 free spins of the slot can begin.\n\nTheme and design\n\nKings of Gold's design is inspired by ancient Egypt and has an opulent and luxurious feel. The background features the deserts of Arabia, a traveler on a camel, an oasis, palms, and the mighty pyramids. Accompanying the action is an Arabic soundtrack that's captivating and perfectly suited to the theme. The design is bright, bold, and easy on the eyes, with black reels bordered in gold. Players will find super-shiny royals from A to J, as well as four ornate Egyptian jewels. These include an ankh cross, the cat god Bastet, and the scarab. The most rewarding symbol is the treasure chest full of gold.\n\nCompatibility\n\nKings of Gold is available to play on all devices, including PC, tablet, and mobile. It works well on mobile devices, with clear images essential when using a mobile device. The gameplay is simple and suitable for playing on a small screen.\n\nPaylines\n\nKings of Gold uses 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 fixed paylines. A win is created in the usual way, by landing 3 or more matching symbols from left to right on a payline starting from reel 1. Players can start their Saharan adventure with bets ranging from 25 cents to 25 euros per spin. \n\nWinning opportunities\n\nKings of Gold's RTP rate is a little slim at 95.14%. The most you can win from a single spin is 1,121x your total bet. The Pharaoh symbol is the Wild symbol. Wild symbols appear stacked and can substitute for any other symbols except for bonus and gold coin symbols.\n\nDeveloper\n\nKings of Gold is developed by iSoftBet and is part of their Hold & Win series slot games. iSoftBet is a premium online and mobile casino games provider with an extensive collection of original and branded games.\n\nGraphics and sound effects\n\nKings of Gold's design is opulent and luxurious and fits the ancient Egyptian theme well, with bright colors and easy to see gold-bordered reels giving players a visual feast. The soundtrack is classical Arabic music that is a perfect complement to the game's theme. The graphics and sound effects are top-notch.\n\n        \n            ",

As part of their Hold & Win series, this game features all the classic features and graphics you'd expect from such a release. Although it doesn't offer many original features, it's still a great way to pass some time for those looking to win big.\n\nKings of Gold doesn't do anything particularly impressive, and in many ways, it's a fairly average release. It starts with the standard 5 reels and 25 lines setup and offers medium rewards up to 1,121x the bet, a below-average RTP of 95.14%, and a mix of features. These include the Hold & Win bonus game, free spins, scatters, and stacked wilds.\n\nAs the latest developer to take players on a journey to the land of the Pharaohs, iSoftBet's Kings of Gold is a 5 reel, 25 payline game that comes with a couple of classic features. The Pharaoh's Gold Respins feature is a strip spin where collecting coins can lead to great rewards. There's also a free spins feature with synchronized reels. Boasting superb graphics and spine-tingling music, this game is sure to impress.\n\nKings of Gold's design is opulent and luxurious, fitting for its name. With an ancient Egyptian theme, the background features the deserts of Arabia, a traveler on a camel, an oasis, palms, and the mighty pyramids. Accompanying the action is a classic Arabic soundtrack that's captivating and perfectly suited to the theme. The design is bright, bold, and easy on the eyes, with black reels bordered in gold.\n\nPlayers will find super shiny royals from A to J, as well as four ornate Egyptian jewels. These include an ankh cross, the cat god Bastet, and the scarab. The most rewarding symbol is the treasure chest full of gold. Landing 5 of these on a payline will earn you a prize equal to 16x your total bet.\n\nThe Pharaoh symbol is the Wild symbol. Wild symbols appear stacked and can substitute for any other symbols except for bonus and gold coin symbols.\n\nKings of Gold is available to play on all devices, including PC, tablet, and mobile. Clear images are essential when using a mobile device, and Kings of Gold's mobile slot game stands out. The gameplay is simple and suitable for playing on a small screen, and it works great.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nKings of Gold uses 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 fixed paylines. A win is created in the usual way, by landing 3 or more matching symbols from left to right on a payline starting from reel 1.\n\nPlayers can start their Saharan adventure with bets ranging from 25 cents to 25 euros per spin. Simply click on the coin symbol to the right of the reels and adjust accordingly. Above the main spin button is the autoplay tab. Click this and set between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins. There are also options for win and loss limits if necessary. Click the lightning bolt in the lower-left corner of the screen to activate turbo spin mode.\n\nKings of Gold's RTP rate is a little slim at 95.14%. The most you can win from a single spin is 1,121x your total bet.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the stacked wild symbol based on the image of the Pharaoh. It can cover full reels, which works well, but it doesn't apply to other feature symbols, which must activate their features themselves.\n\nThe Hold & Win feature is one that iSoftBet has been focusing on lately, and we're seeing it used in Kings of Gold as well. It requires the presence of special bonus symbols in 5 or more positions. These would be the Gold Coins, symbols that are also used during the Respins that follow.\n\nOnly empty spaces, Pharaohs, and Gold Coins can appear during the 3 Respins assigned here. But as more Gold Coins appear, the number of Respins decreases. All Gold Coins have values on them and are sticky. The feature ends when Respins run out or all 15 positions have gold coins stuck on them. If a Pharaoh symbol appears, it collects the Gold Coins in view, and you can start over with new rewards.\n\nAnother common feature, which we also receive from the Reels of Gold, is free spins. This time, the triggering symbol is the Pyramid, another scatter. Only three reels can get these symbols, and all must be visible so that the 8 free spins of the slot can begin.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nTake a journey back to ancient Egypt with another slot based on this popular theme. We present Pharaoh's Fortune, the 5-reel, 15-payline game from IGT. Egyptian-themed slot games are never hard to find, and Pharaoh's Fortune is one of the software additions from giants IGT in this category.\n            ",

As part of their Hold & Win series, this game features all the classic features and graphics you'd expect from such a release. Although it doesn't offer many original features, it's still a great way to pass some time for those looking to win big.\n\nKings of Gold doesn't do anything particularly impressive, and in many ways, it's a fairly average release. It starts with the standard 5 reels and 25 lines setup and offers medium rewards up to 1,121x the bet, a below-average RTP of 95.14%, and a mix of features. These include the Hold & Win bonus game, free spins, scatters, and stacked wilds.\n\nAs the latest developer to take players on a journey to the land of the Pharaohs, iSoftBet's Kings of Gold is a 5 reel, 25 payline game that comes with a couple of classic features. The Pharaoh's Gold Respins feature is a strip spin where collecting coins can lead to great rewards. There's also a free spins feature with synchronized reels. Boasting superb graphics and spine-tingling music, this game is sure to impress.\n\nKings of Gold's design is opulent and luxurious, fitting for its name. With an ancient Egyptian theme, the background features the deserts of Arabia, a traveler on a camel, an oasis, palms, and the mighty pyramids. Accompanying the action is a classic Arabic soundtrack that's captivating and perfectly suited to the theme. The design is bright, bold, and easy on the eyes, with black reels bordered in gold.\n\nPlayers will find super shiny royals from A to J, as well as four ornate Egyptian jewels. These include an ankh cross, the cat god Bastet, and the scarab. The most rewarding symbol is the treasure chest full of gold. Landing 5 of these on a payline will earn you a prize equal to 16x your total bet.\n\nThe Pharaoh symbol is the Wild symbol. Wild symbols appear stacked and can substitute for any other symbols except for bonus and gold coin symbols.\n\nKings of Gold is available to play on all devices, including PC, tablet, and mobile. Clear images are essential when using a mobile device, and Kings of Gold's mobile slot game stands out. The gameplay is simple and suitable for playing on a small screen, and it works great.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nKings of Gold uses 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 fixed paylines. A win is created in the usual way, by landing 3 or more matching symbols from left to right on a payline starting from reel 1.\n\nPlayers can start their Saharan adventure with bets ranging from 25 cents to 25 euros per spin. Simply click on the coin symbol to the right of the reels and adjust accordingly. Above the main spin button is the autoplay tab. Click this and set between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins. There are also options for win and loss limits if necessary. Click the lightning bolt in the lower-left corner of the screen to activate turbo spin mode.\n\nKings of Gold's RTP rate is a little slim at 95.14%. The most you can win from a single spin is 1,121x your total bet.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the stacked wild symbol based on the image of the Pharaoh. It can cover full reels, which works well, but it doesn't apply to other feature symbols, which must activate their features themselves.\n\nThe Hold & Win feature is one that iSoftBet has been focusing on lately, and we're seeing it used in Kings of Gold as well. It requires the presence of special bonus symbols in 5 or more positions. These would be the Gold Coins, symbols that are also used during the Respins that follow.\n\nOnly empty spaces, Pharaohs, and Gold Coins can appear during the 3 Respins assigned here. But as more Gold Coins appear, the number of Respins decreases. All Gold Coins have values on them and are sticky. The feature ends when Respins run out or all 15 positions have gold coins stuck on them. If a Pharaoh symbol appears, it collects the Gold Coins in view, and you can start over with new rewards.\n\nAnother common feature, which we also receive from the Reels of Gold, is free spins. This time, the triggering symbol is the Pyramid, another scatter. Only three reels can get these symbols, and all must be visible so that the 8 free spins of the slot can begin.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nTake a journey back to ancient Egypt with another slot based on this popular theme. We present Pharaoh's Fortune, the 5-reel, 15-payline game from IGT. Egyptian-themed slot games are never hard to find, and Pharaoh's Fortune is one of the software additions from giants IGT in this category.\n            ",
