The minimum bet is 0.01 € per line, but you can adjust it to your liking up to a maximum of 2 €.

Next in line: cherries, bananas, leaf crowns, and finally the chimpanzee.\nThe mango is our Wild symbol and, thanks to its function as a substitute, replaces all symbols except special ones.\nThe Free Spins symbol entitles us to free spins, with 15 for landing three symbols, 30 for four, and 60 for five.

As always, when we're talking about this developer, we know we'll be facing a flawless slot from every point of view. Before venturing into the description of how this game works, let's spend a few words on the graphics, which have been excellently crafted.\n\nThe game grid consists of a series of intertwined branches, with the lush forest in the background.

As for the bet, it starts from a minimum of €0.01 per line, but it can be adjusted to our liking up to a maximum of €2. We win by matching adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel to the right on an active line.\n\nBanana King offers the possibility to select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins and to set the maximum bet (€30) with a single button press.\n\nThe RTP value is 92.81%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nThe game's basic symbols are 10. Starting from the lowest value, we begin with those used to form a royal flush, from 9 to Ace. Next up, we have cherries, bananas, a leaf crown, and finally, the chimpanzee.\n\nThe mango is our Wild symbol, and thanks to its function as a wild card, it replaces all symbols except for special ones.\n\nThe Free Spins symbol gives us free spins: 15 if three symbols land, 30 with four symbols, and a whopping 60 with five symbols. During Free Spins, we can earn more.\n\nThe chimpanzee with the Bonus caption triggers the special function. The grid disappears and rows of bananas appear.

The game boasts a flawless design with graphics excellently crafted. The game grid consists of 5 reels and 3 rows, with selectable lines in steps up to 25 pay lines. We can set our bets from a minimum of €0.01 per line to a maximum of €2 and win by matching adjacent symbols from the leftmost reel to the right on an active line. Banana King offers the possibility to select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins and to set the maximum bet (€30) with a single button press.\n\nBet Limits\n\nIn Banana King, the minimum bet starts from €0.01 per line, which is ideal for beginners or those not wanting to risk much. We can adjust our bets up to a maximum of €2 to play more confidently. Players can also set the maximum bet (€30) with a single button press.\n\nSymbols\n\nBanana King features 10 basic symbols, ranging from royal flush symbols 9 to Ace and cherries, bananas, a leaf crown, and a chimpanzee. The mango is the Wild symbol, which replaces all symbols except for special ones. The Free Spins symbol gives players free spins, which can be 15 with three symbols, 30 with four symbols, and a whopping 60 with five symbols. During Free Spins, players are eligible to earn more. The chimpanzee with the Bonus caption triggers the special function, where the game grid disappears and rows of bananas appear. Players are required to click on some of the bananas and discover the corresponding prize, which ends when the Collect message appears on the screen.\n\nDesign and Theme\n\nWorld Match, the developer of Banana King, has excellently crafted the graphics, presenting players with a lush forest inhabited by chimpanzees that love bananas. The game grid consists of intertwined branches, with the forest providing a perfect background theme. The buttons, which are usually located on the left in most World Match slots, are at the bottom of the screen, with betting statistics, winnings, and the cost of each spin and active lines located below them.\n\nRTP Value\n\nThe RTP value of Banana King is 92.81%. This means that for every €100 wagered, the game pays out an average of €92.81 over time. While this RTP is not the best, it falls within the average range compared to other slot games.\n\n        \n            ",

The grid consists of 5 reels and 3 rows, with intertwined branches in the background. The graphics are well-crafted, and the buttons are at the bottom of the screen.\n\nBanana King gameplay and features\n\nBanana King offers selectable pay lines from 1 to 25 and adjustable bets from €0.01 to €2 per line. We win by matching adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel to the right on an active line. The game also features an Autoplay feature and a Maximum Bet button. Players can select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins.\n\nBanana King bet range and RTP value\n\nThe minimum bet per line is €0.01, and the maximum is €2, with a maximum bet of €30. The RTP value of Banana King is 92.81%.\n\nBanana King symbols and payouts\n\nBanana King has 10 symbols, starting with the lower value used to form a royal flush, from 9 to Ace. We also have cherries, bananas, a leaf crown, and a chimpanzee. The Wild symbol is the mango, which can replace all symbols except for special ones. The Free Spins symbol awards 15, 30, or 60 free spins, depending on how many land on the grid. The game's highest-paying symbol is the chimpanzee, which awards up to 2,500 coins.\n\nBanana King special bonus feature\n\nThe special bonus feature in Banana King is triggered by the chimpanzee with the Bonus caption. When it lands on the grid, the rows of bananas replace the game grid, and we need to click on some of them to reveal the corresponding prize. The game ends when the Collect message appears on the screen.\n\n        \n            ",

As always, when we're talking about this developer, we know we'll be facing a flawless slot from every point of view. Before venturing into the description of how this game works, let's spend a few words on the graphics, which have been excellently crafted.\n\nThe game grid consists of a series of intertwined branches, with the lush forest in the background. Usually, in other World Match slots, the buttons are located on the left, but this time they are at the bottom of the screen. The buttons available are Lines, Bet Level, Start, Max Bet, and Autoplay. Lower down, there are the betting statistics, winnings, and the cost of each spin and active lines.\n\nFeatures of Banana King\n\nThe grid features 5 reels and 3 rows, with selectable lines in steps: we can choose to set 1, 5, 10, 15, or even 25 pay lines. As for the bet, it starts from a minimum of €0.01 per line, but it can be adjusted to our liking up to a maximum of €2. We win by matching adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel to the right on an active line.\n\nBanana King offers the possibility to select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins and to set the maximum bet (€30) with a single button press.\n\nThe RTP value is 92.81%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nThe game's basic symbols are 10.

During Free Spins, we can earn more.\n\nThe chimpanzee with the Bonus caption triggers the special function. The grid disappears and rows of bananas appear.

As always, when we're talking about this developer, we know we'll be facing a flawless slot from every point of view. Before venturing into the description of how this game works, let's spend a few words on the graphics, which have been excellently crafted.\n\nThe game grid consists of a series of intertwined branches, with the lush forest in the background. Usually, in other World Match slots, the buttons are located on the left, but this time they are at the bottom of the screen. The buttons available are Lines, Bet Level, Start, Max Bet, and Autoplay. Lower down, there are the betting statistics, winnings, and the cost of each spin and active lines.\n\nFeatures of Banana King\n\nThe grid features 5 reels and 3 rows, with selectable lines in steps: we can choose to set 1, 5, 10, 15, or even 25 pay lines. As for the bet, it starts from a minimum of €0.01 per line, but it can be adjusted to our liking up to a maximum of €2. We win by matching adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel to the right on an active line.\n\nBanana King offers the possibility to select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins and to set the maximum bet (€30) with a single button press.\n\nThe RTP value is 92.81%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nThe game's basic symbols are 10. Starting from the lowest value, we begin with those used to form a royal flush, from 9 to Ace. Next up, we have cherries, bananas, a leaf crown, and finally, the chimpanzee.\n\nThe mango is our Wild symbol, and thanks to its function as a wild card, it replaces all symbols except for special ones.\n\nThe Free Spins symbol gives us free spins: 15 if three symbols land, 30 with four symbols, and a whopping 60 with five symbols. During Free Spins, we can earn more.\n\nThe chimpanzee with the Bonus caption triggers the special function. The grid disappears and rows of bananas appear. We must click on some of the bananas and discover the corresponding prize. The game ends when the Collect message appears on the screen.\n        ",
