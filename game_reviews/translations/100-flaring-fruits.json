            "response": "100 Flaring Fruits: a simple but essential slot game.\n\nFor those who seek a game with clear rules and minimalistic design, 100 Flaring Fruits has just arrived in all major online casinos. Developed by Gamomat, this fruit-themed slot game focuses more on substance than on appearances, with large symbols, sharp lines, and bright colors lacking in animation and three-dimensionality. But don't be fooled by the simplicity of the graphics – the quality of the design is top-notch, with a black game grid that contrasts perfectly with the orange frame and well-spaced buttons, allowing for a perfect view of your gameplay.\n\n100 Flaring Fruits has 5 reels with 4 rows and 100 paylines, with each spin's cost varying from €1 to €100. The maximum winning payout is 5,000x the bet, with winning combinations requiring at least three identical symbols on a payline, starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding to the right. While there is an Autoplay option available, it does not allow for a set number of spins, so keep an eye on your balance to avoid any surprises.\n\nThe game has low volatility, with a theoretical Return to Player (RTP) of 96.13%. The symbols and corresponding payouts include cherries, lemon, plum, and oranges with the same value, followed by grapes and watermelon. The number 7 symbol is the Wild and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, with a combo of five paying more than any other regular symbols. The star is the Scatter and the most lucrative symbol of all, with the Scatter's winnings added to the base symbol's winnings.\n\nTwo Gamble games are also available, allowing players to double their winnings by guessing the color of a playing card or reaching the last step of a ladder game at the correct time.\n\nIn summary, this slot game is reminiscent of the 80s with an arcade-style soundtrack and has all the makings of a classic online game with its straightforward gameplay and impressive payouts. You can play 100 Flaring Fruits on any device, whether it be a desktop, laptop, or mobile device, on MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS or Android, making it easily accessible to all experienced gamblers.",

With symbols that are large, brightly colored, and lacking in 3D animation, this game is substance over style. However, don't mistake simplicity for poor design.

The cost of each spin ranges from €1 to €100, and players can win up to 5,000 times their bet. The game has low volatility, and the theoretical RTP is 96.13%. To win, players must match at least three identical symbols on a payline from left to right.\n\nWinning potential and paylines\n\nWinning potential in 100 Flaring Fruits is high, with a maximum win of 5,000x the bet. There are 100 paylines, and wins are achieved by matching at least three identical symbols on a payline from left to right. The most lucrative symbol is the Scatter, and its win is added to any other base symbol wins. For more information on payouts, the paytable can be accessed within the game's menu.\n\nDesign and graphics\n\nThe design of 100 Flaring Fruits is simple, with large, brightly colored symbols set against a black game board with orange edges. Despite the lack of 3D animation, the graphics are of top quality, and the various buttons are well-spaced, allowing for an unobstructed view of the action. The arcade-style music accompanying the spins is a throwback to the 80s, lending the game an extra sense of nostalgia and charm.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\n100 Flaring Fruits has low volatility, making it a good option for players who prefer lower-risk games. The theoretical RTP is 96.13%, which is slightly above average and makes the game a potentially profitable choice for the experienced gambler.\n\nGambling options and bonuses\n\n100 Flaring Fruits includes two Gamble games that allow players to double their winnings. In the first, players guess the color of a card drawn from a deck, while in the second, players must climb a ladder and reach the correct level to double their winnings. The number 7 is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, which is the most lucrative symbol in the game. The Scatter win is added to any other base symbol wins.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\n100 Flaring Fruits uses a 5x4 grid and 100 paylines. Players can spin the reels for a cost ranging from €1 to €100 and win by matching at least three identical symbols from left to right. There's also an Autoplay feature, but users cannot set a specific number of spins so they should keep an eye on their balance while using it.\n\nGraphics and design\n\n100 Flaring Fruits stands out for its simple and nostalgic graphics that prioritize substance over style. The game features large and brightly colored symbols that are easy to identify. The black game board perfectly highlights the icons and creates an interesting contrast in combination with the orange borders. Moreover, the game's various buttons are spaced out well and allow players to enjoy an unobstructed view of the game.\n\nWinning potential\n\nThe slot game 100 Flaring Fruits has a maximum win of 5,000x the bet. The game features a Wild symbol that replaces all other symbols, a Scatter symbol that is the most lucrative in the game, and a paytable that users can access to view all symbol payouts. The game has low volatility, which means players can expect frequent, albeit small, wins.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\n100 Flaring Fruits has a low volatility gameplay that rewards players with frequent, smaller wins. The theoretical return to player (RTP) of the game is 96.13%, which means players can expect to win back €96.13 for every €100 wagered in the long run.\n\nSpecial features\n\nIn addition to the classic gameplay features, 100 Flaring Fruits offers players two Gamble games to double their winnings. The first one involves guessing the color of a card drawn from a deck, while the second one requires players to reach the final level of a ladder and click at the right moment. These add an element of excitement and risk to the gameplay, which may appeal to more experienced gamblers.\n\n        \n            ",

With symbols that are large, brightly colored, and lacking in 3D animation, this game is substance over style. However, don't mistake simplicity for poor design. The graphics are of top quality, with the black game board perfectly highlighting the icons and creating a nice contrast against the orange edges. The various buttons are well-spaced, allowing for an unobstructed view of the action.\n\nThe arcade-style music that accompanies the spins is another throwback to the 80s, making 100 Flaring Fruits a game with all the makings of a great online classic.\n\nGame Features:\n\n100 Flaring Fruits uses a 5x4 grid and 100 paylines. The cost of each spin ranges from €1 to €100, with a maximum win of 5,000x. Wins are achieved by matching at least three identical symbols on a payline from left to right. \n\nThe game includes an Autoplay function, although unlike other games, you cannot set a specific number of spins, so it's important to keep an eye on your balance. The game has low volatility, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.13%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\n\nNow, let's talk about the symbols and their corresponding payouts. Cherries, lemons, plums, and oranges all have the same value, followed by grapes and watermelons. For a complete overview of the payouts, access the paytable within the menu.\n\nThe number 7 is the Wild and replaces all symbols except the Scatter. Additionally, a combo of five Wilds pays more than any other regular symbol. The star is the Scatter and is the most lucrative symbol in the game. The Scatter win is added to any other base symbol wins.\n\nThere are two Gamble games which allow players to double their winnings: in the first, players must guess the color of a card drawn from a deck, while in the second, players must reach the final level of a ladder and click at the correct moment.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat is the maximum win in 100 Flaring Fruits?\n\nThe maximum win in this slot can be up to 5,000 times the bet.\n\nOn what devices can I play 100 Flaring Fruits?\n\nThis slot works on any device, whether fixed or mobile. It is compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux for PCs, and iOS and Android for mobile devices.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nThe RTP value is 96.13%.\n        ",
