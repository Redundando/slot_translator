Tutti quanti da piccoli vorrebbero viaggiare nello spazio, visitare nuovi pianeti e, magari, avere delle esperienze elettrizzanti come l’incontro con gli extraterrestri o una battaglia contro degli asteroidi che vogliono distruggere la navicella spaziale.\nCapeCod sa bene di questo desiderio di tutti, per questo ha prodotto una Slot Machine in grado di farti vivere l’esperienza di un viaggio intergalattico, fatto di una grafica eccellente e di funzioni molto interessanti che ti permettono di vincere un sacco di soldi.\nSe vuoi saperne di più su questa Slot Machine a tema spazio, continua a leggere!\nUna grafica intergalattica\nGalaxy Explorer è una Slot Machine prodotta da CapeCod con tema spaziale. Comunque, non si tratta di una grafica futuristica, ma di un tipo di grafica vintage, che rappresentano il futuro come se lo immaginavano i disegnatori di fumetti negli anni Settanta.\nAnche per questo, la Slot Machine può rappresentare qualcosa di diverso e di più interessante. La griglia è una classica 5×3 che si piazza all’interno di un pannello di controllo come quelli che si potrebbero trovare all’interno di un’astronave.\nCiò che maggiormente cattura lo sguardo, però, non è il pannello di controllo dalle fattezze tecnologiche, quanto lo sfondo, che dovrebbe rappresentare ciò che si vede dai finestrini dell’astronave. Ci troviamo davanti ad un pianeta che emana sfumature tra il viola, il blu e il rosa. Si tratta di uno sfondo molto rilassante e molto bello da vedere, quindi l’esperienza di gioco sarà sicuramente più godibile che in molte altre Slot Machine.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nGalaxy Explorer di CapeCod, quindi, è una Slot Machine che fa della grafica e, in particolar modo, dei colori, il suo punto di forza. Ma cosa sappiamo per quanto riguarda le funzioni e i simboli?\nInnanzitutto, come ti abbiamo già premesso, la griglia è una classica 5×3 con un totale di 25 linee di pagamento. Non c’è nulla di speciale in queste informazioni, si tratta di una Slot Machine come molte altre.\nAllo stesso modo, la percentuale di RTP non fa fare salti di gioia. Si attesta sul 95,34%, conquistando un gradino leggermente più in basso dello standard presente sul mercato del 95,5%. Per quanto abbiamo detto fino ad ora, quindi, avrai capito che non si vince molto su questa Slot.\nFortunatamente, tutto questo è compensato da una buona gamma di bonus e funzioni speciali. Una sorpresa molto bella è la presenza di due simboli Wild. Uno è quello normale, rappresentato dalla navicella spaziale. L’altro è un Expanding Wild, che si espande fino ad occupare un intero rullo della Slot. In ogni caso, lo scopo del simbolo è quello di sostituire qualsiasi valore necessario all’interno di una linea di pagamento per ottenere una combinazione vincente.\nQuando 5 simboli Bonus si pongono in linea, inoltre, si attiva la funzione Asteroid Bonus Game. Si tratta di un minigioco in cui dovrai distruggere gli asteroidi sui rulli, per ottenere dei premi casuali ma molto allettanti.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nSe ti piace il genere di Slot Machine ambientata nello spazio, possiamo consigliarti Space Wars di NetEnt. Questa volta la faccenda è dal punto di vista di alcuni alieni simpatici che, grazie anche ad un RTP del 96,8%, ti assicurano alte probabilità di fare un sacco di soldi.\n",

The background view outside the spaceship's window creates a beautiful, relaxing atmosphere for gaming.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nGalaxy Explorer offers exceptional graphics and design with a vintage throwback to the 70s comic book vision of the future. The classic layout is set within a spaceship control panel, while the planet in shades of purple, blue, and pink creates a stunning background.\n\nBonus Features\n\nGalaxy Explorer offers two types of wild symbols, a regular spaceship and an expanding wild that fills an entire reel. Both can replace any value on a payline to form a winning combination. In addition, the Asteroid Bonus Game starts when five bonus symbols align on a payline, where players can destroy the asteroids on the reels for random cash prizes.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nIf you're a fan of space-themed slots, NetEnt's Space Wars is a good choice featuring cute aliens with a high RTP of 96.8%, offering extra chances for huge cash rewards.\n\nPotential Winnings\n\nAlthough the RTP of 95.34% falls a bit short of the market standard, the bonus features in Galaxy Explorer offer exciting chances for players to win big cash prizes.\n\n        \n            ",

Destroy the asteroids on the reels for exciting random cash prizes. \n\nIf you're a fan of space-themed slots, we suggest you also try Space Wars by NetEnt. This game, featuring cute aliens with a high RTP of 96.8%, ensures extra chances for huge cash rewards.
