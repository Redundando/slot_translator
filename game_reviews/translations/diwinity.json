According to our humble opinion, this slot is almost perfect – from its sleek graphics to its exciting bonus features that increase your chances of winning. The interface is essential and intuitive, which is a plus. \n\nIn terms of graphics, all symbols are of gods (or objects related to the residents of Olympus) and resemble cartoon styles.

The buttons to start the game, for automatic spins, and to vary the bet can be found on the left of the grid, and the menu button is on the right. \n\nThe music with its epic tone is engaging and immersive and can be deactivated from the menu.\n\nKey features: Diwinity has 20 fixed paylines positioned on a grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The minimum bet starts from 0.01 € per line, which means that each spin costs only 0.20 €. Of course, you can increase the bet as you please, up to a maximum of 60 € Total. The volatility is low, inviting frequent wins with modest figures, and the RTP value is 94.88%.\n\nSymbols and functions of Diwinity: In total, we found 14 symbols, five of which are special. Starting from the lowest-valued symbols, we see Q, K, and A. Immediately after that, we have Artemis, the goddess of hunting; Athena, the deity of justice; Apollo, the sun god; Venus, the goddess of beauty; and Zeus, the godfather of the gods.\n\nWe have two Wild symbols, represented by Dionysus and Poseidon, respectively. They replace all symbols except the special ones, and if they appear during Free Spins, they will remain stuck during subsequent spins. \n\nAnother special symbol is the Wild Scatter that turns some random symbols into Wild. From time to time, we can also come across one or more x2 multipliers, with a maximum win of 8x.\n\nThe shield with the image of Medusa is the Bonus symbol. When it appears, we will be prompted to choose between Free Spins or the Bonus game. The latter involves breaking some shields to receive cash prizes.\n\nExperience the allure of Diwinity and immerse yourself in the world of the gods for your chance to win big!\n        ",

It's like being a knight in shining armor - except you're smashing shields instead of saving damsels in distress.</p><p>So, what are you waiting for?

Well, look no further than Diwinity! This game has not one, but two, amazing bonus features that will leave you spinning with excitement.</p><p>The first bonus feature that Diwinity offers is Free Spins. Activate this bonus by landing the Bonus symbol during the base game, and you can earn up to 10 free spins! Plus, during these free spins, the Wild symbols remain stuck, giving you even more chances to hit those big wins. It's like getting free fries with your burger - you can't go wrong!</p><p>If that's not enough excitement for you, then how about the Bonus game? This feature is triggered when you land the Bonus symbol and choose to play it. Once inside the Bonus game, you get to break shields to reveal cash prizes. So, not only do you get to smash things (which is always a good time), but you also get to walk away with some serious coin. It's like being a knight in shining armor - except you're smashing shields instead of saving damsels in distress.</p><p>So, what are you waiting for? Give Diwinity a spin and take advantage of these awesome bonus features. You never know, you could be the lucky one to crack open those shields and hit the jackpot!</p>\"\n}"

The minimum bet starts from 0.01 € per line, and the game offers two Wild symbols, Wild Scatter, and a Bonus symbol with a choice between Free Spins or the Bonus game.\n\nGraphics and Interface\n\nDiwinity's graphics are sleek and consist of cartoon-style symbols that depict gods or objects related to the residents of Olympus. The reels move within a frame supported by two columns with a fountain in the background. The buttons for starting the game, automatic spins, and varying the bet can be found on the left, and the menu button is on the right. The music is an epic soundtrack that can be deactivated from the menu.\n\nKey Features\n\nDiwinity has a low volatility that invites frequent wins with modest figures, and the RTP value is 94.88%. The game offers a minimum bet of 0.01 € per line and a maximum of 60 € Total. The game's Wild symbols represented by Dionysus and Poseidon replace all symbols except the special ones, and if they appear during Free Spins, they remain stuck during subsequent spins. Another special symbol is the Wild Scatter that turns some random symbols into Wild. We can also come across one or more x2 multipliers, with a maximum win of 8x.\n\nSymbols and Functions\n\nThere are 14 symbols in Diwinity, including five special ones. The lowest-valued symbols are Q, K, and A. The higher-valued symbols are Artemis, the goddess of hunting; Athena, the deity of justice; Apollo, the sun god; Venus, the goddess of beauty; and Zeus, the godfather of the gods. The shield with Medusa's image is the Bonus symbol, prompting the player to choose between Free Spins or the Bonus game.\n\nBonus Features\n\nDiwinity offers two bonus features. The first are Free Spins, activated when the Bonus symbol appears during the base game. The player is rewarded with up to 10 Free Spins, during which the Wild symbols remain stuck. The second bonus feature is the Bonus game, which is triggered when the player chooses it after landing the Bonus symbol. In the Bonus game, the player breaks shields to receive cash prizes.\n\n        \n            ",

According to our humble opinion, this slot is almost perfect – from its sleek graphics to its exciting bonus features that increase your chances of winning. The interface is essential and intuitive, which is a plus. \n\nIn terms of graphics, all symbols are of gods (or objects related to the residents of Olympus) and resemble cartoon styles. The reels move within a frame supported by two columns and with a fountain in the background. The buttons to start the game, for automatic spins, and to vary the bet can be found on the left of the grid, and the menu button is on the right. \n\nThe music with its epic tone is engaging and immersive and can be deactivated from the menu.\n\nKey features: Diwinity has 20 fixed paylines positioned on a grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The minimum bet starts from 0.01 € per line, which means that each spin costs only 0.20 €. Of course, you can increase the bet as you please, up to a maximum of 60 € Total. The volatility is low, inviting frequent wins with modest figures, and the RTP value is 94.88%.\n\nSymbols and functions of Diwinity: In total, we found 14 symbols, five of which are special. Starting from the lowest-valued symbols, we see Q, K, and A. Immediately after that, we have Artemis, the goddess of hunting; Athena, the deity of justice; Apollo, the sun god; Venus, the goddess of beauty; and Zeus, the godfather of the gods.\n\nWe have two Wild symbols, represented by Dionysus and Poseidon, respectively. They replace all symbols except the special ones, and if they appear during Free Spins, they will remain stuck during subsequent spins. \n\nAnother special symbol is the Wild Scatter that turns some random symbols into Wild. From time to time, we can also come across one or more x2 multipliers, with a maximum win of 8x.\n\nThe shield with the image of Medusa is the Bonus symbol. When it appears, we will be prompted to choose between Free Spins or the Bonus game. The latter involves breaking some shields to receive cash prizes.\n\nExperience the allure of Diwinity and immerse yourself in the world of the gods for your chance to win big!\n            ",

According to our humble opinion, this slot is almost perfect – from its sleek graphics to its exciting bonus features that increase your chances of winning. The interface is essential and intuitive, which is a plus. \n\nIn terms of graphics, all symbols are of gods (or objects related to the residents of Olympus) and resemble cartoon styles. The reels move within a frame supported by two columns and with a fountain in the background. The buttons to start the game, for automatic spins, and to vary the bet can be found on the left of the grid, and the menu button is on the right. \n\nThe music with its epic tone is engaging and immersive and can be deactivated from the menu.\n\nKey features: Diwinity has 20 fixed paylines positioned on a grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The minimum bet starts from 0.01 € per line, which means that each spin costs only 0.20 €. Of course, you can increase the bet as you please, up to a maximum of 60 € Total. The volatility is low, inviting frequent wins with modest figures, and the RTP value is 94.88%.\n\nSymbols and functions of Diwinity: In total, we found 14 symbols, five of which are special. Starting from the lowest-valued symbols, we see Q, K, and A. Immediately after that, we have Artemis, the goddess of hunting; Athena, the deity of justice; Apollo, the sun god; Venus, the goddess of beauty; and Zeus, the godfather of the gods.\n\nWe have two Wild symbols, represented by Dionysus and Poseidon, respectively. They replace all symbols except the special ones, and if they appear during Free Spins, they will remain stuck during subsequent spins. \n\nAnother special symbol is the Wild Scatter that turns some random symbols into Wild. From time to time, we can also come across one or more x2 multipliers, with a maximum win of 8x.\n\nThe shield with the image of Medusa is the Bonus symbol. When it appears, we will be prompted to choose between Free Spins or the Bonus game. The latter involves breaking some shields to receive cash prizes.\n\nExperience the allure of Diwinity and immerse yourself in the world of the gods for your chance to win big!\n            ",
