Medusa is the wild icon that can replace all symbols except the scatter.\n\nIt's a true extravaganza of colors, applied to a gameplay that is very interesting both on desktop and mobile. Finally, the slot has high variance, which means that it manages to guarantee many low wins at a good pace: practically 1 in 3 spins can win you something.\n\nAmong the bonus features that Medusa: Fortune and Glory offers, we mention the Spreading Wilds, where 1, 2 or 3 wilds can be distributed respectively on the reels that range from 2 to 5.

Medusa: Fortune & Glory is a mythical journey that relies on some extra features with wilds, 2 different free spin modes and 20x multipliers. And all of this is completed with a maximum win of up to 74,400x. But that's just the beginning: let's see what the ancient gods have in store for us and what lies behind its 96.62% RTP, above the average percentage of many online slots.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe first thing that every player notices when approaching this title is its stunning graphics, worthy of a top-notch slot. And a big part of this successful graphic effect is, without a doubt, the unusual feel that it offers, especially thanks to the creative flair of the provider who came up with it.\n\nWe are therefore confronted with an ancient Greek theme with clean lines, with a background represented by a temple on which stands the heads of snakes. The effect is truly fascinating, although it loses some of its magic due to the choice of the soundtrack, which is anything but \"ancient\", but still very catchy.\n\nThe symbols that we encounter start with the stone symbols from A to 10, flanked by legendary creatures among which the inevitable Pegasus, the famous winged horse, stands out. But the luckiest symbol is the Minotaur, capable of awarding up to 10 times your bet if you find 6 symbols in combination. Medusa is the wild icon that can replace all symbols except the scatter.\n\nIt's a true extravaganza of colors, applied to a gameplay that is very interesting both on desktop and mobile. Finally, the slot has high variance, which means that it manages to guarantee many low wins at a good pace: practically 1 in 3 spins can win you something.\n\nAmong the bonus features that Medusa: Fortune and Glory offers, we mention the Spreading Wilds, where 1, 2 or 3 wilds can be distributed respectively on the reels that range from 2 to 5. Equally interesting are the Free Spins, which are triggered by placing the Bonus symbols at least 3 or 4 times on the game board. They allow you to release 5 or 10 times your bet.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Medusa: Fortune and Glory slot\nMedusa: Fortune and Glory is an unusual ancient adventure that will not disappoint. The graphic rendering is superb, even a little daring if we have to admit it, and the features that can be activated round after round are very interesting. During the free spin phase, you can enjoy moments of action that can turn into a rich treasure to take home. The important thing is to be able to take advantage of the multipliers.\n\nIf you're passionate about ancient Greece, our advice is to try Medusa: Fortune & Glory right away and go in search of its treasures. This experienced gambler knows that with this slot machine, you'll have a journey to remember and a chance to win big!\n            ",

Medusa: Fortune & Glory is a mythical journey that relies on some extra features with wilds, 2 different free spin modes and 20x multipliers. And all of this is completed with a maximum win of up to 74,400x. But that's just the beginning: let's see what the ancient gods have in store for us and what lies behind its 96.62% RTP, above the average percentage of many online slots.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe first thing that every player notices when approaching this title is its stunning graphics, worthy of a top-notch slot. And a big part of this successful graphic effect is, without a doubt, the unusual feel that it offers, especially thanks to the creative flair of the provider who came up with it.\n\nWe are therefore confronted with an ancient Greek theme with clean lines, with a background represented by a temple on which stands the heads of snakes. The effect is truly fascinating, although it loses some of its magic due to the choice of the soundtrack, which is anything but \"ancient\", but still very catchy.\n\nThe symbols that we encounter start with the stone symbols from A to 10, flanked by legendary creatures among which the inevitable Pegasus, the famous winged horse, stands out. But the luckiest symbol is the Minotaur, capable of awarding up to 10 times your bet if you find 6 symbols in combination. Medusa is the wild icon that can replace all symbols except the scatter.\n\nIt's a true extravaganza of colors, applied to a gameplay that is very interesting both on desktop and mobile. Finally, the slot has high variance, which means that it manages to guarantee many low wins at a good pace: practically 1 in 3 spins can win you something.\n\nAmong the bonus features that Medusa: Fortune and Glory offers, we mention the Spreading Wilds, where 1, 2 or 3 wilds can be distributed respectively on the reels that range from 2 to 5. Equally interesting are the Free Spins, which are triggered by placing the Bonus symbols at least 3 or 4 times on the game board. They allow you to release 5 or 10 times your bet.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Medusa: Fortune and Glory slot\nMedusa: Fortune and Glory is an unusual ancient adventure that will not disappoint. The graphic rendering is superb, even a little daring if we have to admit it, and the features that can be activated round after round are very interesting. During the free spin phase, you can enjoy moments of action that can turn into a rich treasure to take home. The important thing is to be able to take advantage of the multipliers.\n\nIf you're passionate about ancient Greece, our advice is to try Medusa: Fortune & Glory right away and go in search of its treasures. This experienced gambler knows that with this slot machine, you'll have a journey to remember and a chance to win big!\n        ",
