Per questo, si otterranno 10 giri liberi che si giocheranno sul set di bobine massimo con sette file e 16.807 modi per vincere.\nIl secondo tipo sono i Collectable Free Spins che vengono assegnati per la raccolta di un numero sufficiente di cristalli di un colore. Ci sono cristalli verdi, arancioni, blu e rossi che possono atterrare solo su file espanse.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nImmaginare delle miniere piene di nani che estraggono i minerali preziosi è qualcosa di proposto già nella letteratura fantasy di molto tempo fa.

The game comes with an Expanding Reels feature that triggers when the player lands a bonus symbol and expands the reel set by one row. This ultimately leads the player to a free spin round where he/she can collect collectible crystals. The game also includes an Autoplay feature, and the paytable contains eleven symbols in total.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nDwarf Mine is designed to take players on an adventure through the underground world of dwarves as they search for hidden treasures in the mines. Its fantasy graphics are illustrated with colorful and sharp graphics that help bring the theme to life. The reels are placed inside a primitive hydraulic excavator operated by a red-bearded dwarf, and the reels expand and retract as the player spins them. The theme also features the remains of ancient people and dinosaurs, as well as a dwarf's hat encapsulated in solid rock.\n\nBonus Features\n\nDwarf Mine includes two free spin rounds as its main bonus features. The first free spin round activates when a player lands three scatter symbols on reels one, three, and five in a single spin. This feature awards 10 free spins played on an expanded reel set with seven rows and 16,807 ways to win. The second bonus feature of the game, Collectable Free Spins, is awarded for collecting enough crystals of the same color. These crystals appear only on the expanded rows.\n\nBetting Options\n\nDwarf Mine provides a wide range of betting options, with a minimum bet of £0.10 and a maximum bet of £125.00. The game features a coin system with adjustable coin values, so players can adjust their bets at any time by pressing the “-/+” button. Those who want to place the maximum bet quickly can use the “Max Bet” button.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nFor those looking for similar games with the theme of dwarves in the mines, Dwarven Gold by Pragmatic Play is a great option.
