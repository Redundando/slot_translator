Saremo infatti alle prese con nuovi colorati animali, i simpatici abitanti di una fattoria. Il gameplay di questa slot machine sfrutta la modalità Floating Reels, già utilizzata nella precedente versione; in questo gioco le icone entrano in gioco da sotto, salendo proprio come dei palloncini verso il cielo. Ogni volta che otterremo una combinazione vincente, i palloncini che ne fanno parte esploderanno. Al posto dei palloncini esplosi, ne entreranno in gioco di nuovi che daranno ulteriori possibilità di creare combinazioni vincenti nuove durante lo stesso “spin”.\nGrafica della slot machine\nSe nella precedente versione eravate rimasti colpiti dalla qualità delle animazione e dalla grafica, giocando con la nuova Balloonies Farm non resterete affatto delusi. La IGT infatti, ha confezionato un altro lavoro realizzato con la massima cura nei dettagli, con animazioni ancora più fluide e divertenti. Gli effetti visivi e quelli sonori, sono stati migliorati ulteriormente per rendere ancora più piacevoli le partite a questo titolo di grande successo. I simboli presenti, raffiguranti per lo più palloncini a forma di animali, e l’ambientazione circostante, mantengono il proprio stile “cartoonesco” come nel precedente titolo per un risultato finale piacevole da vedere e divertente da giocare. Anche in Balloonies Farm sono presenti 3 lettere, A, Q e K, del set di animali precedentemente usati è rimasto il Cane Blu; in aggiunta troviamo una Pecora, una Mucca e un Maialino sempre in stile palloncino. Anche la Stella è un altro simbolo ricorrente, ma questa volta fungerà anche da Wild oltre a regalare moltiplicatori come in Balloonies. Il simbolo Bonus è nuovamente il Palloncino Rosso, pronto a farci vincere i free spin.\nLe funzioni e i bonus della slot\nBalloonies Farm è una slot machine che permette di giocare su una griglia 5 per 3 con 20 linee di pagamento. La Stella in questa versione fungerà anche da simbolo Wild, permettendoci così di terminare le combinazioni non andate a buon fine nel migliore dei modi. Può presentarsi esclusivamente sui rulli 2, 3 e 4 e ogni volta ti regalerà un moltiplicatore variabile da x2, x3 oppure x5, cumulabile in caso si presentino più simboli Stella insieme. Il Palloncino Rosso è lo Scatter della slot; si può presentare solo sui rulli 2, 3 e 4 e grazie a tre di questi simboli possiamo partecipare ai giri bonus della slot. Potremo scegliere uno dei 4 palloncini di colore differente che vedremo sul monitor per scoprire il numero di free spin vinti, che può variare da 5 fino a 15 totali. Oltre ad assegnare un numero di giri bonus, i 4 palloncini manterranno per tutta la durata dei free spin un moltiplicatore variabile per ogni Stella che uscirà:\n\nIl Palloncino azzurro, 15 free spin con moltiplicatore x2\nIl Palloncino verde, 12 free spin con moltiplicatori x2 e x3\nIl Palloncino viola, 9 free spin con moltiplicatori x3 e x5\nIl Palloncino rosso, 5 free spin con moltiplicatori x5 e x10\n\nSlot simili a Balloonies\nBalloonies Farm è un altro gioco assolutamente da provare, molto simile al precedente Ballonies come dinamiche, adatto a tutti i tipi di giocatori anche ai meno esperti. Grazie alla modalità Floating Reels il divertimento è assicurato; non sarà affatto difficile infatti, portare a casa buone vincite attraverso questa funzione insieme ai tanti moltiplicatori presenti nella slot machine. Un altro colpo portato a segno dalla IGT.\n",

New balloon symbols come into play in the spaces left by the exploded ones, offering extra chances to create more winning combos on the same spin. The Star symbol also acts as the Wild symbol, helping to complete winning combinations, appearing on reels 2, 3, and 4, and offering variable multipliers of x2, x3, or x5, which can accumulate with more Star symbols. The Red Balloon is the Scatter symbol, appearing only on reels 2, 3, and 4. Three of these symbols trigger the slot's free spin feature.\n\nVisual and Sound Effects\n\nThe game features impressive and colorful graphics with charming farm animals in cartoonish style, including the Blue Dog, Sheep, Cow, and Pig. The surrounding farm scenery is also pleasant to the eye and creates a fun playing experience. The delightful sound effects enhance the overall atmosphere of the game.\n\nSymbols and Multipliers\n\nThe Star symbol, which is also the Wild symbol, offers various multipliers of x2, x3, or x5, which can accumulate with more Star symbols. The Red Balloon is the Scatter symbol, and three of these symbols trigger the slot's free spin feature.

In the free spin feature, the selected balloon holds a variable multiplier for each Star symbol that appears during the free spins, which vary depending on the color of the chosen balloon.\n\nFree Spin Feature\n\nThe free spin feature is triggered by landing three Red Balloon symbols on reels 2, 3, and 4, and players must then select one of the four different colored balloons on the screen to reveal the number of free spins won, ranging from 5 to 15. The selected balloon also holds a variable multiplier for each Star symbol that appears during the free spins, which vary depending on the color of the chosen balloon. The four different colored balloons and multipliers are as follows: Blue balloon - 15 free spins with x2 multiplier. Green balloon - 12 free spins with x2 and x3 multipliers.

This new chapter in the balloon saga features colorful and charming farm animals, the friendly residents of a picturesque farm. The Floating Reels mode, already used in the previous version, is the main gameplay mechanism, where symbols enter the grid from below and rise like balloons towards the sky, exploding when forming winning combinations. New balloon symbols come into play in the spaces left by the exploded ones, offering extra chances to create more winning combos on the same spin.\n\nSlot graphics\nIf you were impressed by the animations and graphics of the previous version, you will not be disappointed with this new game. IGT has crafted another masterpiece, with attention to detail and even smoother and more amusing animations. The visual and sound effects have been improved to enhance the enjoyment of this hugely successful title. The cartoonish style of the animal-shaped balloon symbols and the surrounding farm scenery, including the Blue Dog, Sheep, Cow, and Pig, has been retained for an overall pleasant and fun playing experience. The recurring Star symbol is not only the Wild symbol but also offers various multipliers, as in the previous version. The Red Balloon still acts as the Bonus symbol, triggering the free spin feature.\n\nSlot functions and bonuses\nBalloonies Farm is a 5x3 reel slot game with 20 paylines. The Star symbol also acts as the Wild symbol, helping to complete winning combinations. It appears on reels 2, 3, and 4, offering variable multipliers of x2, x3, or x5, which can accumulate with more Star symbols. The Red Balloon is the Scatter symbol, appearing only on reels 2, 3, and 4. Three of these symbols trigger the slot's free spin feature, where we select one of the four different colored balloons on the screen to reveal the number of free spins won, ranging from 5 to 15. The selected balloon also holds a variable multiplier for each Star symbol that appears during the free spins, which vary depending on the color of the chosen balloon:\n\nBlue balloon - 15 free spins with x2 multiplier.\nGreen balloon - 12 free spins with x2 and x3 multipliers.\nPurple balloon - 9 free spins with x3 and x5 multipliers.\nRed balloon - 5 free spins with x5 and x10 multipliers.\n\nSimilar slots\nBalloonies Farm is a must-try game, similar to its predecessor Ballonies regarding gameplay and suitable for all types of players, even those less experienced.
