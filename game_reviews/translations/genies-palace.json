The Genie of Genie's Palace promises to grant them all!\n\nTheme and Graphics\n\nWho among you is not familiar with the story of Aladdin and the genie of the lamp? With the title \"Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp,\" this tale is one of the most famous stories in the equally renowned compilation, \"The Thousand and One Nights.\"\n\nThe story tells of a young man named Aladdin, a streetwise delinquent, who is hired to collect a treasure in a cave. He discovers a mysterious lamp that will change his life forever. Inside the lamp resides a genie who promises to grant him three wishes.\n\nThe protagonist of Genie's Palace, a slot produced by the software house High 5 Games, is the genie of the lamp, in an oriental-themed setting created with great attention to detail and extreme care for all the intricate aspects.\n\nThe background is represented by a typical Arab landscape, with the domes of an ancient Middle Eastern city immersed in a landscape of blue and violet hues.\n\nAdding to the immersive gameplay experience is a classic Arabic melody, which leads the player to fully immerse themselves in an atmosphere reminiscent of \"The Thousand and One Nights\"!\n\nAre you ready to make your wishes come true?\n\nMain Features of the Slot Machine\n\nGenie's Palace is a slot machine with a traditional structure, with a game grid composed of 5 reels and 5 rows. There are 25 paylines, on which you can make bets ranging from 25 cents up to a maximum of €75, a range that we consider excellent for those who are just approaching the world of slot machines, but also for those who like to place slightly larger bets.\n\nGenie's Palace is characterized by a very high volatility: you will probably experience a significant number of losses before obtaining potentially rewarding wins, up to a maximum of 2,000 times the value of the bet.\n\nRegarding the theoretical return to the player (RTP), Genie's Palace is set at 96%, perfectly in line with the average.\n\nTo know the value of all the symbols and their combinations, we suggest consulting the paytable, which can be accessed by clicking on the \"I\" button.\n\nIf you want to play without spending any money, or if you want to try the slot for free before investing real money, there is a demo version of Genie's Palace available, free and without the need for registration!\n\nSymbols and Features of Genie's Palace\n\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Genie's Palace are represented by a series of differently colored diamonds, which pay up to 50 credits for a combination of 5, a treasure-filled chest, a turban, and a magic carpet, which is the icon that pays the most.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by colorful gems.

He discovers a mysterious lamp that will change his life forever. Inside the lamp resides a genie who promises to grant him three wishes.\n\nThe protagonist of Genie's Palace, a slot produced by the software house High 5 Games, is the genie of the lamp, in an oriental-themed setting created with great attention to detail and extreme care for all the intricate aspects.\n\nThe background is represented by a typical Arab landscape, with the domes of an ancient Middle Eastern city immersed in a landscape of blue and violet hues.\n\nAdding to the immersive gameplay experience is a classic Arabic melody, which leads the player to fully immerse themselves in an atmosphere reminiscent of \"The Thousand and One Nights\"!\n\nAre you ready to make your wishes come true?\n\nMain Features of the Slot Machine\n\nGenie's Palace is a slot machine with a traditional structure, with a game grid composed of 5 reels and 5 rows. There are 25 paylines, on which you can make bets ranging from 25 cents up to a maximum of €75, a range that we consider excellent for those who are just approaching the world of slot machines, but also for those who like to place slightly larger bets.\n\nGenie's Palace is characterized by a very high volatility: you will probably experience a significant number of losses before obtaining potentially rewarding wins, up to a maximum of 2,000 times the value of the bet.\n\nRegarding the theoretical return to the player (RTP), Genie's Palace is set at 96%, perfectly in line with the average.\n\nTo know the value of all the symbols and their combinations, we suggest consulting the paytable, which can be accessed by clicking on the \"I\" button.\n\nIf you want to play without spending any money, or if you want to try the slot for free before investing real money, there is a demo version of Genie's Palace available, free and without the need for registration!\n\nSymbols and Features of Genie's Palace\n\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Genie's Palace are represented by a series of differently colored diamonds, which pay up to 50 credits for a combination of 5, a treasure-filled chest, a turban, and a magic carpet, which is the icon that pays the most.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by colorful gems. It serves as a wild but also determines wins when it appears on the reels.\n\nThere are other special symbols in Genie's Palace that allow access to extra features and award free spins and rich multipliers.\n\nWhen you collect 12 or more Wild symbols on the game grid, the jackpot feature is activated, and the highest prize of 2,000 times the bet is awarded. \n\nSo, are you ready to try your luck in the world of Genies?\n            ",
