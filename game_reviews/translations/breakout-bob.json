E non parliamo soltanto del gameplay o dei bonus disseminati durante tutto il gioco, ma anche e soprattutto della bellissima grafica in stile cartone animato. D’altronde è questa la prima cosa che notiamo quando accediamo alla schermata di gioco, con le alte mura del carcere a fare da sfondo ai rulli. Accanto alla griglia c’è Bob, il nostro carcerato eroe con un piano, ossia evadere dal carcere facendo saltare in aria il muro con delle bombe. Purtroppo per lui però dovrà fare i conti con gli agenti e un bulldog-poliziotto che non hanno per niente voglia di rendergli la vita facile.\nLa musica che accompagna le giocate è molto soft, per nulla invasiva, inoltre ad ogni vincita Bob si complimenterà con noi.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nBreakout Bob ha una griglia di gioco quadrata, con 4 rulli e 4 righe. Le linee di pagamento sono fisse, 6 per l’esattezza, ed è possibile scommettere da un minimo di 0,05 € sino a un massimo di 500 €. Vengono pagate solo le combinazioni vincenti che si verificano da sinistra a destra e, in caso di vincite multiple, viene pagata soltanto la più alta. Volendo, si possono impostare da 5 a 100 giri automatici e c’è pure la funzione turbo per accelerare la rotazione dei rulli. Breakout Bob ha un RTP notevole, pari al 96,52%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nI simboli regolari sono solo 5, ma pagano molto bene. A differenza della maggior parte delle slot, qui si vince soltanto con 3 o 4 simboli adiacenti. Partendo dal valore più basso a salire, troviamo le manette, i soldi, il cane poliziotto, l’agente e Bob. Il simbolo Wild è la nuvola di fumo che segue l’esplosione della bomba. Oltre a essere pagante, sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter, rappresentato dalla bomba. Se sui rulli appaiono 3 simboli Scatter avremo diritto a 12 partite gratuite, con 4 simboli i Free Spins saranno 18. Durante le partite gratis tutti gli Scatter che si presentano saranno raccolti da Bob e alla fine del gioco bonus, verranno trasformati in Wild e piazzati in modo casuale sui rulli.\nOltre a questo, Breakout Bob ha due giochi bonus, entrambi che si verificano in modo casuale. La prima funzione detta “Bomb” assegna tra i 4 e i 6 giri gratis, durante i quali avremo un moltiplicatore progressivo 2X, 3X, 5X, 10X, 15X e 25X.\nIl secondo gioco Bonus è la ruota della fortuna. Il nostro compito è quello di far girare la ruota e sperare che si fermi su uno dei 4 spicchi colorati per vincere uno tra i 3 premi Minor, Major e Grand, che sono fissi e si basano sul valore della puntata iniziale.\n",

And we're not just talking about the gameplay or the bonuses scattered throughout the game, but also and above all, the beautiful cartoon-style graphics. After all, this is the first thing we notice when we access the game screen, with high prison walls as the background to the reels. Next to the grid is Bob, our heroic prisoner with a plan, to escape from prison by blowing up the wall with bombs. Unfortunately for him, he will have to deal with the agents and a police-bulldog who have no desire to make his life easy.\n\nThe music that accompanies the game is very soft, not at all invasive, and Bob will compliment us after each win. \n\nSlot Features\nBreakout Bob has a square game grid with 4 reels and 4 rows. The paylines are fixed, exactly 6, and you can bet from a minimum of €0.05 up to a maximum of €500. Only winning combinations that occur from left to right are paid out, and in case of multiple wins, only the highest one is paid. Optionally, you can set from 5 to 100 automatic spins, and there is also a turbo function to speed up the rotation of the reels. Breakout Bob has an impressive RTP of 96.52%.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\nThere are only 5 regular symbols, but they pay out very well. Unlike most slots, here you win only with 3 or 4 adjacent symbols. Starting from the lowest value and going up, we find handcuffs, money, the police dog, the agent, and Bob. The Wild symbol is the smoke cloud that follows the explosion of the bomb. In addition to being paying, it replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the bomb. If 3 Scatter symbols appear on the reels, we are entitled to 12 free spins, with 4 symbols the Free Spins will be 18. During the free spins, all Scatter symbols that appear will be collected by Bob and at the end of the bonus game, they will be transformed into Wild symbols and placed randomly on the reels.\n\nIn addition to this, Breakout Bob has two bonus games, both of which occur randomly. The first function called \"Bomb\" assigns between 4 and 6 free spins, during which we will have a progressive multiplier of 2X, 3X, 5X, 10X, 15X, and 25X.\n\nThe second bonus game is the Wheel of Fortune.

And we're not just talking about the gameplay or the bonuses scattered throughout the game, but also and above all, the beautiful cartoon-style graphics. After all, this is the first thing we notice when we access the game screen, with high prison walls as the background to the reels. Next to the grid is Bob, our heroic prisoner with a plan, to escape from prison by blowing up the wall with bombs. Unfortunately for him, he will have to deal with the agents and a police-bulldog who have no desire to make his life easy.\n\nThe music that accompanies the game is very soft, not at all invasive, and Bob will compliment us after each win. \n\nSlot Features\nBreakout Bob has a square game grid with 4 reels and 4 rows. The paylines are fixed, exactly 6, and you can bet from a minimum of €0.05 up to a maximum of €500. Only winning combinations that occur from left to right are paid out, and in case of multiple wins, only the highest one is paid. Optionally, you can set from 5 to 100 automatic spins, and there is also a turbo function to speed up the rotation of the reels. Breakout Bob has an impressive RTP of 96.52%.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\nThere are only 5 regular symbols, but they pay out very well. Unlike most slots, here you win only with 3 or 4 adjacent symbols. Starting from the lowest value and going up, we find handcuffs, money, the police dog, the agent, and Bob. The Wild symbol is the smoke cloud that follows the explosion of the bomb. In addition to being paying, it replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the bomb. If 3 Scatter symbols appear on the reels, we are entitled to 12 free spins, with 4 symbols the Free Spins will be 18. During the free spins, all Scatter symbols that appear will be collected by Bob and at the end of the bonus game, they will be transformed into Wild symbols and placed randomly on the reels.\n\nIn addition to this, Breakout Bob has two bonus games, both of which occur randomly. The first function called \"Bomb\" assigns between 4 and 6 free spins, during which we will have a progressive multiplier of 2X, 3X, 5X, 10X, 15X, and 25X.\n\nThe second bonus game is the Wheel of Fortune. Our task is to spin the wheel and hope it stops on one of the 4 colored slices to win one of the 3 Minor, Major, and Grand prizes, which are fixed and based on the initial bet value.\n\nExperience the thrill of the prison break with Breakout Bob. The stunning graphics and exciting bonus games make for a thrilling gaming experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Don't miss out on the chance to win big with this impressive slot game.\n            ",

And we're not just talking about the gameplay or the bonuses scattered throughout the game, but also and above all, the beautiful cartoon-style graphics. After all, this is the first thing we notice when we access the game screen, with high prison walls as the background to the reels. Next to the grid is Bob, our heroic prisoner with a plan, to escape from prison by blowing up the wall with bombs. Unfortunately for him, he will have to deal with the agents and a police-bulldog who have no desire to make his life easy.\n\nThe music that accompanies the game is very soft, not at all invasive, and Bob will compliment us after each win. \n\nSlot Features\nBreakout Bob has a square game grid with 4 reels and 4 rows. The paylines are fixed, exactly 6, and you can bet from a minimum of €0.05 up to a maximum of €500. Only winning combinations that occur from left to right are paid out, and in case of multiple wins, only the highest one is paid. Optionally, you can set from 5 to 100 automatic spins, and there is also a turbo function to speed up the rotation of the reels. Breakout Bob has an impressive RTP of 96.52%.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\nThere are only 5 regular symbols, but they pay out very well. Unlike most slots, here you win only with 3 or 4 adjacent symbols. Starting from the lowest value and going up, we find handcuffs, money, the police dog, the agent, and Bob. The Wild symbol is the smoke cloud that follows the explosion of the bomb. In addition to being paying, it replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the bomb. If 3 Scatter symbols appear on the reels, we are entitled to 12 free spins, with 4 symbols the Free Spins will be 18. During the free spins, all Scatter symbols that appear will be collected by Bob and at the end of the bonus game, they will be transformed into Wild symbols and placed randomly on the reels.\n\nIn addition to this, Breakout Bob has two bonus games, both of which occur randomly. The first function called \"Bomb\" assigns between 4 and 6 free spins, during which we will have a progressive multiplier of 2X, 3X, 5X, 10X, 15X, and 25X.\n\nThe second bonus game is the Wheel of Fortune. Our task is to spin the wheel and hope it stops on one of the 4 colored slices to win one of the 3 Minor, Major, and Grand prizes, which are fixed and based on the initial bet value.\n\nExperience the thrill of the prison break with Breakout Bob. The stunning graphics and exciting bonus games make for a thrilling gaming experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Don't miss out on the chance to win big with this impressive slot game.\n            ",

And we're not just talking about the gameplay or the bonuses scattered throughout the game, but also and above all, the beautiful cartoon-style graphics. After all, this is the first thing we notice when we access the game screen, with high prison walls as the background to the reels. Next to the grid is Bob, our heroic prisoner with a plan, to escape from prison by blowing up the wall with bombs. Unfortunately for him, he will have to deal with the agents and a police-bulldog who have no desire to make his life easy.\n\nThe music that accompanies the game is very soft, not at all invasive, and Bob will compliment us after each win. \n\nSlot Features\nBreakout Bob has a square game grid with 4 reels and 4 rows. The paylines are fixed, exactly 6, and you can bet from a minimum of €0.05 up to a maximum of €500. Only winning combinations that occur from left to right are paid out, and in case of multiple wins, only the highest one is paid. Optionally, you can set from 5 to 100 automatic spins, and there is also a turbo function to speed up the rotation of the reels. Breakout Bob has an impressive RTP of 96.52%.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\nThere are only 5 regular symbols, but they pay out very well. Unlike most slots, here you win only with 3 or 4 adjacent symbols. Starting from the lowest value and going up, we find handcuffs, money, the police dog, the agent, and Bob. The Wild symbol is the smoke cloud that follows the explosion of the bomb. In addition to being paying, it replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the bomb. If 3 Scatter symbols appear on the reels, we are entitled to 12 free spins, with 4 symbols the Free Spins will be 18. During the free spins, all Scatter symbols that appear will be collected by Bob and at the end of the bonus game, they will be transformed into Wild symbols and placed randomly on the reels.\n\nIn addition to this, Breakout Bob has two bonus games, both of which occur randomly. The first function called \"Bomb\" assigns between 4 and 6 free spins, during which we will have a progressive multiplier of 2X, 3X, 5X, 10X, 15X, and 25X.\n\nThe second bonus game is the Wheel of Fortune. Our task is to spin the wheel and hope it stops on one of the 4 colored slices to win one of the 3 Minor, Major, and Grand prizes, which are fixed and based on the initial bet value.\n\nExperience the thrill of the prison break with Breakout Bob. The stunning graphics and exciting bonus games make for a thrilling gaming experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Don't miss out on the chance to win big with this impressive slot game.\n            ",
