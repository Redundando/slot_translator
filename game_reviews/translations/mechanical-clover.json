This is why all providers, big or small, have tackled this theme at some point, often creating truly spectacular slots.\n\nBGaming's take on this theme is quite impressive: combining historical elements with the steampunk genre seems like a brilliant move.\n\nFor those who don't know, steampunk refers to a literary movement that sets its stories in the Victorian era, when technological progress relied solely on steam and increasingly precise gears capable of moving anything.\n\nThe graphics fully reflect this movement: the fruits seem to be made of metallic material yet still maintain their bright colors, and they move within a grid set in an attic. Surrounding them are pipes and bulbs, with two bells on the sides: one indicates the active paylines, while the other shows the multiplier applied at the moment of the spin.\n\nSlot Features\n\nThe game grid has 3 reels and 3 rows with 5 active paylines, which increase to 27 during the bonus round.\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.10 and can be increased up to a maximum of €50. You can choose the autoplay mode, from as little as 10 spins up to 1,000 or infinite, and simply click the same button again to stop. There are also several threshold limits that, once reached, will stop the automatic spins.\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.8%.\n\nSymbols and Functions\n\nThe symbols are almost all traditional ones seen in classic slots, such as cherries, plums, oranges, lemons, watermelons, bells, and double 7s, plus a cylinder-shaped hat.\n\nTo understand their value, simply refer to the paytable. As mentioned earlier, the game is played with 5 active lines in regular play. The four-leaf clover is the Wild symbol, landing only on the middle reel and completing winning combinations. It also has another function, which is to award between 1 and 6 free spins. During the bonus round, paylines increase to 27, and a progressive multiplier from x2 to x7 is also assigned to each Respin. Additional paylines and multipliers are shown in the bells next to the reels.\n\nIn addition to these features, there's also a Gamble function, which allows you to increase the last win or lose the entire amount. Here’s how it works: after a winning combination, two symbols will appear under the grid: a dollar symbol to collect the win and a card symbol to risk it. If you choose the latter, you'll see five playing cards: one on top and four below. The banker will reveal their card, and you'll have to choose one of the four hoping it's higher than theirs.\n\nOverall, Mechanical Clover is an exquisitely designed slot that offers an enjoyable gaming experience, with plenty of features to keep things interesting for experienced gamblers.\n            ",

The game's wild symbol is the four-leaf clover, which only appears on the middle reel and completes winning combinations. Landing the wild symbol can also award between 1 and 6 free spins. During the bonus round, paylines increase to 27, and a progressive multiplier from x2 to x7 is also assigned to each Respin. There is also a Gamble function, which allows players to increase the last win or lose the entire amount.\n\nGame Design\n\nMechanical Clover's design is inspired by steampunk, a literary movement set in the Victorian era. The game's fruits are made of metallic material and move within a grid set in an attic. Surrounding them are pipes and bulbs, with two bells on the sides: one indicates the active paylines, while the other shows the multiplier applied at the moment of the spin.\n\nPaylines and Betting Range\n\nMechanical Clover has 5 active paylines in regular play, which increase to 27 during the bonus round. The minimum bet is €0.10, and the maximum bet is €50. Players can choose the autoplay mode, with options ranging from 10 to 1,000 or infinite spins. There are also several threshold limits that, once reached, will stop the automatic spins.\n\nBonus Features\n\nMechanical Clover has several bonus features that add excitement to the game. Landing the wild symbol can award between 1 and 6 free spins, during which paylines increase to 27, and a progressive multiplier from x2 to x7 is also assigned to each Respin. There is also a Gamble function that allows players to increase the last win or lose the entire amount. The Gamble function presents players with five playing cards, one on top and four below. The banker will reveal their card, and the player must choose one of the four hoping it's higher.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP)\n\nMechanical Clover has a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.8%, which is a decent payout percentage for online slot games. This means that, on average, for every €100 played, the game will pay out €96.80 in winnings.\n\n        \n            ",

This is why all providers, big or small, have tackled this theme at some point, often creating truly spectacular slots.\n\nBGaming's take on this theme is quite impressive: combining historical elements with the steampunk genre seems like a brilliant move.\n\nFor those who don't know, steampunk refers to a literary movement that sets its stories in the Victorian era, when technological progress relied solely on steam and increasingly precise gears capable of moving anything.\n\nThe graphics fully reflect this movement: the fruits seem to be made of metallic material yet still maintain their bright colors, and they move within a grid set in an attic. Surrounding them are pipes and bulbs, with two bells on the sides: one indicates the active paylines, while the other shows the multiplier applied at the moment of the spin.\n\nSlot Features\n\nThe game grid has 3 reels and 3 rows with 5 active paylines, which increase to 27 during the bonus round.\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.10 and can be increased up to a maximum of €50. You can choose the autoplay mode, from as little as 10 spins up to 1,000 or infinite, and simply click the same button again to stop. There are also several threshold limits that, once reached, will stop the automatic spins.\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.8%.\n\nSymbols and Functions\n\nThe symbols are almost all traditional ones seen in classic slots, such as cherries, plums, oranges, lemons, watermelons, bells, and double 7s, plus a cylinder-shaped hat.\n\nTo understand their value, simply refer to the paytable. As mentioned earlier, the game is played with 5 active lines in regular play. The four-leaf clover is the Wild symbol, landing only on the middle reel and completing winning combinations. It also has another function, which is to award between 1 and 6 free spins. During the bonus round, paylines increase to 27, and a progressive multiplier from x2 to x7 is also assigned to each Respin. Additional paylines and multipliers are shown in the bells next to the reels.\n\nIn addition to these features, there's also a Gamble function, which allows you to increase the last win or lose the entire amount. Here’s how it works: after a winning combination, two symbols will appear under the grid: a dollar symbol to collect the win and a card symbol to risk it. If you choose the latter, you'll see five playing cards: one on top and four below. The banker will reveal their card, and you'll have to choose one of the four hoping it's higher than theirs.\n\nOverall, Mechanical Clover is an exquisitely designed slot that offers an enjoyable gaming experience, with plenty of features to keep things interesting for experienced gamblers.\n            ",

This is why all providers, big or small, have tackled this theme at some point, often creating truly spectacular slots.\n\nBGaming's take on this theme is quite impressive: combining historical elements with the steampunk genre seems like a brilliant move.\n\nFor those who don't know, steampunk refers to a literary movement that sets its stories in the Victorian era, when technological progress relied solely on steam and increasingly precise gears capable of moving anything.\n\nThe graphics fully reflect this movement: the fruits seem to be made of metallic material yet still maintain their bright colors, and they move within a grid set in an attic. Surrounding them are pipes and bulbs, with two bells on the sides: one indicates the active paylines, while the other shows the multiplier applied at the moment of the spin.\n\nSlot Features\n\nThe game grid has 3 reels and 3 rows with 5 active paylines, which increase to 27 during the bonus round.\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.10 and can be increased up to a maximum of €50. You can choose the autoplay mode, from as little as 10 spins up to 1,000 or infinite, and simply click the same button again to stop. There are also several threshold limits that, once reached, will stop the automatic spins.\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.8%.\n\nSymbols and Functions\n\nThe symbols are almost all traditional ones seen in classic slots, such as cherries, plums, oranges, lemons, watermelons, bells, and double 7s, plus a cylinder-shaped hat.\n\nTo understand their value, simply refer to the paytable. As mentioned earlier, the game is played with 5 active lines in regular play. The four-leaf clover is the Wild symbol, landing only on the middle reel and completing winning combinations. It also has another function, which is to award between 1 and 6 free spins. During the bonus round, paylines increase to 27, and a progressive multiplier from x2 to x7 is also assigned to each Respin. Additional paylines and multipliers are shown in the bells next to the reels.\n\nIn addition to these features, there's also a Gamble function, which allows you to increase the last win or lose the entire amount. Here’s how it works: after a winning combination, two symbols will appear under the grid: a dollar symbol to collect the win and a card symbol to risk it. If you choose the latter, you'll see five playing cards: one on top and four below. The banker will reveal their card, and you'll have to choose one of the four hoping it's higher than theirs.\n\nOverall, Mechanical Clover is an exquisitely designed slot that offers an enjoyable gaming experience, with plenty of features to keep things interesting for experienced gamblers.\n        ",
