I colori dello sfondo ovviamente sono scuri e in questo contesto risaltano il rosso delle scritte e i volti dei protagonisti.\nLe icone tematiche che si alternano sui rulli sono dedicate ai volti di diversi vampiri, bellissimi neanche a dirlo, e riprodotti con grande dovizia di particolari, con la pelle candida e gli occhi scintillanti.\nIn caso di vincita i rulli si incendiano, con un effetto grafico molto suggestivo, che contribuisce a rendere avvincente l’esperienza di gioco.\n\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nIn uno scenario molto tetro e oscuro sono posizionati i cinque rulli e le tre righe della slot. Le linee di pagamento di Blood Lust sono ben 99, e il numero può essere impostato grazie ai tasti posizionati in alto a sinistra sul menù.\nSu questa slot è possibile effettuare le proprie puntate a partire da un minimo di 20 centesimi fino a un massimo di 100 €, mentre la vincita più alta a cui si può ambire è, in crediti di gioco, pari a 250.000 monete.\nUna cosa interessante di Blood Lust è la possibilità di settare secondo diversi parametri anche le giocate in modalità automatica, che varieranno di volta in volta secondo le impostazioni date.\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore si attesta su un canonico 96%, niente di speciale ma del tutto nella media. La volatilità, nonostante il premio più alto sia pari solo a 2.500 volte il valore della puntata, è alta, il che significa che occorrerà avere un po’ di pazienza ma che potrete potenzialmente mettere le mani su ricchi premi.\n\nSimboli e funzionalità di Blood Lust\nI simboli che si alternano sui rulli di Blood Lust sono sia tematici che non. Quelli non tematici sono rappresentati dai quattro semi delle carte da gioco, cuori, fiori, picche e denari, riprodotti in colori brillanti, che tra tutte, sono le icone con minor valore.\nPer ottenere delle vincite più alte bisogna sperare che sui rulli compaiano i volti pallidi e affascinanti dei vampiri, che pagano per allineamenti di almeno tre simboli uguali, sempre da sinistra verso destra. Il simbolo più remunerativo in assoluto è il vampiro biondo con gli occhi gialli.\nÈ presente un Wild, identificato semplicemente dalla scritta corrispondente, e un Bonus, che permette di accedere a un numero di giri gratuiti variabile da quattro a quindici.\nAltre funzioni speciali sono quella Boosted Stacks e Boosted Respins, che aumentano le possibilità di ottenere delle combinazioni vincenti.\n",

The background colors are obviously dark and in this context, the red of the writing and the faces of the protagonists stand out.\n\nThe themed symbols that alternate on the reels are devoted to the faces of different vampires, beautiful to say the least, and reproduced with great attention to detail, with pale skin and sparkling eyes.\n\nIn the event of a win, the reels ignite with a very suggestive graphic effect that contributes to making the gaming experience exciting.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nThe five reels and three rows of the slot are positioned in a very dark and gloomy scenario. Blood Lust has 99 pay lines, and the number can be set thanks to the keys positioned in the top left corner of the menu.\n\nIn this slot, it is possible to place bets starting from a minimum of 20 cents up to a maximum of 100€, while the highest win to be coveted is 250,000 coins in game credits.\n\nOne interesting thing about Blood Lust is the ability to set different parameters for automatic play, which will vary from time to time according to the given settings.\n\nThe theoretical return to player is at a standard 96%, nothing special but entirely within the average. The volatility, despite the highest prize being only 2,500 times the value of the bet, is high, which means that you will need to have a bit of patience, but you may potentially get your hands on rich rewards.\n\nSymbols and functions of Blood Lust\n\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Blood Lust are both thematic and non-thematic. The non-thematic ones are represented by the four suits of playing cards, hearts, flowers, spades, and diamonds, reproduced in bright colours, which are, in total, the icons with lower value.\n\nTo get the highest winnings, one must hope that the pale and fascinating faces of the vampires appear on the reels, which pay for alignments of at least three identical symbols, always from left to right. The most rewarding symbol of all is the blond-haired vampire with yellow eyes.\n\nThere is a Wild, simply identified by the corresponding writing, and a Bonus, which allows access to a variable number of free spins, ranging from four to fifteen.\n\nOther special features include Boosted Stacks and Boosted Respins, which increase the chances of getting winning combinations.",

The background colors are obviously dark, making the red lettering and faces of the protagonists stand out.\n\nThe thematic icons that alternate on the reels are dedicated to the faces of different vampires, who are of course beautiful, and reproduced with great attention to detail, with their white skin and sparkling eyes. In case of a win, the reels catch fire, with a very suggestive visual effect that contributes to making the gaming experience exciting.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nIn a very dark and gloomy setting, the five reels and three rows of the slot are positioned. Blood Lust’s paylines are set at a solid 99, and players can adjust the number using the buttons at the top left of the menu.\n\nOn this slot machine, players can make their bets starting from a minimum of 20 cents up to a maximum of 100 €, while the highest payout to which to aspire is, in game credits, equal to 250,000 coins.\n\nOne interesting thing about Blood Lust is the ability to set different automatic betting parameters, which will vary from time to time depending on the settings given.\n\nThe theoretical return to player is a solid 96%, nothing too special, but entirely average. The volatility, despite the fact that the highest payout is only 2,500 times the value of the bet, is high, which means that you will need a bit of patience but can potentially get your hands on rich rewards.\n\nSymbols and functionality of Blood Lust\n\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Blood Lust are both thematic and non-thematic. The non-thematic ones are represented by the four suits of playing cards, hearts, flowers, spades, and diamonds, reproduced in bright colors, and they are the icons with the lowest value among all.\n\nTo obtain higher payouts, players must hope that the pale and mesmerizing faces of the vampires appear on the reels, paying for alignments of at least three identical symbols, always from left to right. The highest paying symbol of them all is the blonde vampire with yellow eyes.\n\nThere is a Wild, simply identified by the corresponding word, and a Bonus, which allows players to access a variable number of free spins, ranging from four to fifteen. Other special features are Boosted Stacks and Boosted Respins, which increase the chances of obtaining winning combinations.\n            ",

The background colors are obviously dark, making the red lettering and faces of the protagonists stand out.\n\nThe thematic icons that alternate on the reels are dedicated to the faces of different vampires, who are of course beautiful, and reproduced with great attention to detail, with their white skin and sparkling eyes. In case of a win, the reels catch fire, with a very suggestive visual effect that contributes to making the gaming experience exciting.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nIn a very dark and gloomy setting, the five reels and three rows of the slot are positioned.

The background colors are obviously dark, making the red lettering and faces of the protagonists stand out.\n\nThe thematic icons that alternate on the reels are dedicated to the faces of different vampires, who are of course beautiful, and reproduced with great attention to detail, with their white skin and sparkling eyes. In case of a win, the reels catch fire, with a very suggestive visual effect that contributes to making the gaming experience exciting.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nIn a very dark and gloomy setting, the five reels and three rows of the slot are positioned. Blood Lust’s paylines are set at a solid 99, and players can adjust the number using the buttons at the top left of the menu.\n\nOn this slot machine, players can make their bets starting from a minimum of 20 cents up to a maximum of 100 €, while the highest payout to which to aspire is, in game credits, equal to 250,000 coins.\n\nOne interesting thing about Blood Lust is the ability to set different automatic betting parameters, which will vary from time to time depending on the settings given.\n\nThe theoretical return to player is a solid 96%, nothing too special, but entirely average. The volatility, despite the fact that the highest payout is only 2,500 times the value of the bet, is high, which means that you will need a bit of patience but can potentially get your hands on rich rewards.\n\nSymbols and functionality of Blood Lust\n\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Blood Lust are both thematic and non-thematic. The non-thematic ones are represented by the four suits of playing cards, hearts, flowers, spades, and diamonds, reproduced in bright colors, and they are the icons with the lowest value among all.\n\nTo obtain higher payouts, players must hope that the pale and mesmerizing faces of the vampires appear on the reels, paying for alignments of at least three identical symbols, always from left to right. The highest paying symbol of them all is the blonde vampire with yellow eyes.\n\nThere is a Wild, simply identified by the corresponding word, and a Bonus, which allows players to access a variable number of free spins, ranging from four to fifteen. Other special features are Boosted Stacks and Boosted Respins, which increase the chances of obtaining winning combinations.\n        ",
