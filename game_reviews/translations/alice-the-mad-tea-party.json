Le immagini sono riprodotte in stile cartone animato utilizzando dei colori molto vividi, per un’esperienza di gioco divertente e che non mancherà di coinvolgere anche i giocatori più esigenti!\nCaratteristiche principali della slot\nAlice & The Mad Tea Party Slot è una slot con un gameplay molto ben articolato, che offre interessanti potenzialità di vincita. Dal punto di vista della struttura, presenta cinque rulli, tre righe e 30 linee di pagamento fisse.\nGiocando con Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot si possono effettuare delle puntate a partire da un solo centesimo per giro, fino a un massimo di 2 €. Questo potrebbe far storcere il naso ai cosiddetti high roller, ossia ai giocatori che amano effettuare delle puntate molto sostanziose, tuttavia il gameplay abbastanza complesso e le numerose opportunità per vincere, sopperiscono largamente a un range di scommesse così ristretto.\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP) di Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot si attesta su un buon 96,03%, niente di sbalorditivo ma in linea con la maggior parte dei giochi di slot.\nQuesto gioco della WMS è caratterizzato inoltre da una volatilità molto alta (4,5/5), per cui non scoraggiatevi se non ottenete delle vincite frequenti: basterà saper attendere e la vostra pazienza potrebbe essere ripagata con premi di un certo valore!\nSimboli e funzionalità speciali di Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot\nI simboli che si alternano sui rulli di Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot sono tutti tematici: non sono infatti presenti i numeri e le lettere che si riferiscono alle carte da gioco ma troviamo solamente i quattro semi, picche, fiori, cuori e quadri.\nI simboli sono rappresentati dalla scritta “Alice”, dalla protagonista della storia, dal Cappellaio Matto, il Bianconiglio, la torta di colore rosa, un’ampolla magica, le tazzine da tè.\nIl simbolo Wild è il jolly del gioco e sostituisce tutti gli altri simboli quando si tratta di completare una combinazione vincente. Lo Scatter invece attiva la modalità speciale The Mad Tea Party Free Spin Bonus Feature, che permette di accedere a sei giri gratuiti. Prima di ogni free spin al giocatore sarà chiesto di scegliere tra una delle teiere che compaiono sulla schermata, a ciascuna delle quali corrisponde un ulteriore premio.\nÈ presente inoltre una funzione Super Mad Respin, che viene attivata quando sui rulli appaiono tre simboli rappresentanti Alice; anche in questo caso il premio consiste in giri gratuiti.\n",

There are very few slots that have chosen this fairy tale as a theme, so we applaud the originality! The images are depicted in cartoon style using very vivid colors, creating a fun gaming experience that is sure to engage even the most demanding gamblers!\n\nKey Features of the Slot\nAlice & The Mad Tea Party Slot has a very well-structured gameplay that offers interesting winning potential. From a structural standpoint, it features five reels, three rows, and 30 fixed paylines. Playing Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot, you can make bets starting from just one cent per spin, up to a maximum of 2€. This may raise eyebrows among so-called high rollers, i.e., those players who like to make substantial bets. However, the fairly complex gameplay and numerous opportunities to win more than make up for such a limited betting range. The return to player (RTP) in Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot stands at a good 96.03%, nothing astounding, but in line with most slot games. This WMS game is also notorious for having very high volatility (4.5/5), so don’t be discouraged if you do not achieve frequent wins; just wait, and your patience may be rewarded with some valuable prizes!\n\nSymbols and Special Features of Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot are all thematic. The numbers and letters representing playing cards are not present; we simply have the four suits, spades, flowers, hearts, and diamonds. The symbols are represented by the word \"Alice,\" the protagonist of the story, the Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, a pink cake, a magic vial, and teacups. The Wild symbol is the game’s joker, replacing all other symbols when completing a winning combination. The Scatter, on the other hand, activates the special feature The Mad Tea Party Free Spin Bonus, which allows access to six free spins. Before each free spin, the player will be asked to choose from one of the teapots that appears on the screen, each of which corresponds to an additional prize.

The images are reproduced in cartoon style using very vivid colors for a fun gaming experience that will even engage the most demanding players!\n\nMain features of the slot\n\nAlice & The Mad Tea Party Slot is a slot with a very well-articulated gameplay that offers interesting winning potentials. From a structural point of view, it features five reels, three rows, and 30 fixed pay lines.\nPlaying with Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot, you can place bets starting from just one cent per spin, up to a maximum of €2. This may not appeal to high rollers, i.e., players who like to make very substantial bets. However, the gameplay is complex enough, and the numerous opportunities to win largely make up for such a restricted range of bets.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot is a good 96.03%, nothing astounding but in line with most slot games.\nThis WMS game is also characterized by very high volatility (4.5/5), so do not be discouraged if you do not get frequent payouts: just be patient, and your patience could be rewarded with significant prizes!\n\nSymbols and special features of Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot\n\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Alice & The Mad Tea Party Slot are all thematic: the numbers and letters that refer to playing cards are not present, but only the four suits, spades, flowers, hearts, and diamonds.\nThe symbols are represented by the word \"Alice,\" the story's protagonist, the Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, the pink cake, a magic vial, and tea cups.\nThe Wild symbol is the game's joker and replaces all other symbols when it comes to completing a winning combination. The Scatter, on the other hand, activates the special mode The Mad Tea Party Free Spin Bonus Feature, which allows access to six free spins. Before each free spin, the player will be asked to choose one of the teapots that appear on the screen, each of which corresponds to an additional prize.\nThere is also a Super Mad Respin function, which is activated when three symbols representing Alice appear on the reels. Again, the prize consists of free spins.\n            ",
