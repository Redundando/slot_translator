Ora potete rivivere l’avventura di Marco mentre andate alla ricerca delle vostre ricchezze, e sarete ben ricompensati per aver trovato lungo il cammino oggetti a tema, tra cui le lettere e i numeri che Marco Polo ha imparato per poter comunicare con il grande signore della guerra mongolo, così come le mappe, i forzieri e lo stesso Kublai Khan. Potrai anche beneficiare dei cammelli Scatter e Wild che possono offrirti giri gratis e moltiplicatori di premi che possono renderti ricco oltre i tuoi sogni più sfrenati.\nE si può iniziare quest’avventura con molto poco in banca, dato che le puntate partono da 1 sola moneta a giro. Questa epica avventura è perfetta anche per giocare su computer portatili e desktop.\nUna grafica che è un viaggio verso terre inesplorate\nC’era un uomo i cui scritti hanno influenzato molti altri viaggiatori durante il Medioevo. Fu Marco Polo che andò in Cina e riscoprì questa civiltà per i mercantilisti e i viaggiatori europei. Questo portò a molti nuovi viaggi, al commercio e all’innovazione. Certamente, la slot di Marco Polo non è l’unica cosa che immortala questo straordinario personaggio storico, perché ci sono scuole che portano il suo nome, piazze pubbliche e biblioteche. Ma i suoi viaggi lungo la via della seta hanno dato il via all’arrivo di nuovi prodotti in Europa e viceversa. Così abbiamo una serie di simboli che risalgono a quell’epoca nella fessura Marco Polo realizzata con il rastrello rosso.\nQuesto gioco di slot ha le cinque bobine standard e tre file. Il tema è ovvio, poiché anche i simboli delle carte alte assomigliano alla calligrafia cinese, mentre i simboli delle figure sono una bussola, una moneta cinese, un ventaglio a mano, un libro e il simbolo Yin Yang. Il gioco ha una lunga e comoda gamma di scommesse e queste funzionano sulle 30 linee di pagamento sempre attive. Quindi abbiamo un’avventura divertente con tutto questo, più un bonus gratuito per le rotazioni e la scelta per questo o una vincita istantanea.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nIl gioco viene fornito con un grande premio di payout massimo di 30.000€, ma ci sono molteplici grandi ricompense che possono essere raggiunte anche con una scommessa più piccola. Una delle caratteristiche del gioco sono i giri gratuiti. Questa funzione bonus si attiva atterrando tre dei simboli yin yang, tuttavia, le slot Marco Polo sono uno dei giochi più rari al mondo il cui simbolo jolly sostituisce lo scatter/bonus. In questo caso, anche due wilds possono sostituire il bonus.\nDurante il bonus, se ci sono simboli bonus aggiuntivi che appaiono come tre, quattro o cinque per spin, la funzione bonus verrà recuperata. Inoltre, c’è la possibilità che l’intera bobina sia coperta dal simbolo del bonus. In questo caso, i giocatori ricevono un moltiplicatore 60x su tutte le vincite fino a quel punto.\nLa tabella di pagamento dinamica del gioco riflette gli importi di pagamento del simbolo in base alla scommessa selezionata. Se i giocatori vincono cinque simboli corrispondenti delle monete cinesi su una scommessa di €3, il premio sarà di €100. Un premio di 50 euro viene fornito con cinque compassi e 25 euro con cinque dei libri aperti.\nLa funzione di giri gratis viene fornita con un incredibile vantaggio.

Con una moneta da un penny, la scommessa più piccola su tutte queste linee di pagamento è di 0,30 euro per giro. Ci sono molti importi che possono essere selezionati in seguito a questa, fino al raggiungimento del limite massimo di 30,00 euro a giro. La gamma di scommesse offre ai giocatori molte scelte su cui costruire un gameplay e una strategia per coloro che preferiscono pensare in questo modo.

Now you can relive Marco's adventure as you search for your own riches, and you will be well rewarded for finding themed objects along the way, including the letters and numbers that Marco Polo learned to communicate with the great Mongol warlord, as well as maps, treasure chests and Kublai Khan himself. You can also benefit from the Scatter and Wild camels that can offer free spins and prize multipliers that can make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.\n\nAnd you can start this adventure with very little in the bank, as bets start with just 1 coin per spin. This epic adventure is also perfect for playing on laptops and desktops.\n\nGraphics that take you on a journey to unexplored lands\n\nThere was a man whose writings influenced many other travelers during the Middle Ages. It was Marco Polo who went to China and rediscovered this civilization for the merchants and European travelers. This led to many new voyages, commerce and innovation. Certainly, the Marco Polo slot is not the only thing that immortalizes this extraordinary historical figure, as there are schools that bear his name, public squares and libraries. But his travels along the Silk Road led to the arrival of new products in Europe and vice versa. So we have a series of symbols that date back to that era in the Marco Polo slot machine made with the red rake.\n\nThis slot game has the standard five reels and three rows. The theme is obvious, as even the high card symbols resemble Chinese calligraphy, while the figure symbols are a compass, a Chinese coin, a handheld fan, a book and the Yin Yang symbol. The game has a long and comfortable range of bets and these work on the always active 30 paylines. So we have a fun adventure with all this, plus a free bonus for spins and the choice for this or an instant win.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe game comes with a huge maximum payout prize of €30,000, but there are multiple big rewards that can be achieved even with a smaller bet. One of the game's features is the free spins. This bonus feature is activated by landing three yin yang symbols, however, the Marco Polo slots are one of the rarest games in the world whose wild symbol replaces the scatter/bonus. In this case, even two wilds can replace the bonus.\n\nDuring the bonus, if there are additional bonus symbols that appear as three, four or five per spin, the bonus feature will be replayed. In addition, there is a chance that the entire reel will be covered by the bonus symbol. In this case, players receive a 60x multiplier on all winnings up to that point.\n\nThe game's dynamic paytable reflects the symbol payment amounts based on the selected bet. If players win five matching Chinese coin symbols on a €3 bet, the prize will be €100. A prize of €50 is provided with five compasses and €25 with five of the open books.\n\nThe free spins feature comes with an incredible advantage. All wins receive a 2x multiplier, which is double the amount won, whether there are activated respins or not. The Marco Polo wild symbol replaces the yin yang symbol. But even before the game is launched, players can choose whether to collect instant wins or let free spins play out.\n\nThe game is easy to set up and there is no need to activate paylines, as all 30 are active at the same time. With a penny coin, the smallest bet on all these paylines is €0.30 per spin. There are many amounts that can be selected after this, up to the maximum limit of €30.00 per spin. The range of bets offers players many choices on which to build a gameplay and strategy for those who prefer to think in this way. That said, there are few other buttons that can have a say in the gaming experience.\n\nThe autoplay option allows players to choose one of the preset automatic spin numbers. There is no loss or win limit to set in the Marco Polo slot as there is in some other slot games, but this is fine because the highest number of spins is 100, so players just have to think about their balance or anticipate how this might play out. To make single spins, just use the orange spin button in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nSilk Road Riches takes players back to the era of mainland travel, when transporting goods from one end of the world to the other required cunning and muscle strength. Leander Games has given this game a series of extra features and the dynamic payment system that makes each reel a dynamic zone in its own right.",

Now you can relive Marco's adventure while you search for your own riches, and you'll be well rewarded for finding themed objects along the way, including letters and numbers that Marco Polo learned to communicate with the great Mongol warlord, as well as maps, chests, and Kublai Khan himself. You can also benefit from Scatter and Wild camels that can offer you free spins and prize multipliers that can make you richer beyond your wildest dreams.\nAnd you can start this adventure with very little in your bank, as bets start at just one coin per spin. This epic adventure is also perfect for playing on laptops and desktops.\nA graphics that is a journey to unexplored lands\nThere was a man whose writings influenced many other travelers during the Middle Ages. It was Marco Polo who went to China and rediscovered this civilization for European merchants and travelers. This led to many new travels, commerce, and innovation. Certainly, Marco Polo's slot machine is not the only thing that immortalizes this extraordinary historical figure, as there are schools that bear his name, public squares, and libraries. But his travels along the Silk Road led to the arrival of new products in Europe and vice versa. So we have a series of symbols dating back to that era in the Marco Polo slot machine made with the red rake.\nThis slot game has the standard five reels and three rows. The theme is obvious, as even the high card symbols resemble Chinese calligraphy, while the figure symbols are a compass, a Chinese coin, a hand fan, a book, and the Yin Yang symbol. The game has a long and comfortable range of bets and these work on the 30 always-on paylines. So we have a fun adventure with all of this, plus a free bonus for spins and the choice for this or an instant win.\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe game comes with a huge maximum payout of €30,000, but there are multiple big rewards that can be achieved even with a smaller bet. One of the features of the game is free spins. This bonus feature is activated by landing three of the yin yang symbols, however, the Marco Polo slots are one of the rarest games in the world whose wild symbol replaces the scatter/bonus. In this case, even two wilds can replace the bonus.\nDuring the bonus, if there are additional bonus symbols that appear as three, four, or five per spin, the bonus feature will be retrieved. In addition, there is a chance that the entire reel is covered by the bonus symbol. In this case, players receive a 60x multiplier on all winnings up to that point.\nThe dynamic payout table of the game reflects the symbol payout amounts based on the selected bet. If players win five matching symbols of Chinese coins on a €3 bet, the prize will be €100. A prize of €50 is provided with five compasses and €25 with five open books.\nThe free spins feature comes with an incredible advantage. All winnings receive a 2x multiplier, i.e. double the amount won, regardless of whether reruns are activated or not. Marco Polo's wild symbol replaces the yin yang symbol. But even before the game is launched, players can choose whether to collect instant wins or let free spins take place.\nThe game is easy to set up and there is no need to activate the paylines, as all 30 are active at the same time. With a penny coin, the smallest bet on all these paylines is €0.30 per spin. There are many amounts that can be selected following this, up to the maximum limit of €30.00 per spin. The range of bets offers players many choices on which to build gameplay and a strategy for those who prefer to think in this way. That said, there are few other buttons that can have a say in the gaming experience.\nThe autoplay option allows players to choose one of the preset automatic spin numbers. There is no loss or win limit to set in the Marco Polo slot, as in some other slot games, but this is fine because the highest number of spins is 100, so players just have to think about their balance or anticipate how this might play out. To make single spin takes, simply use the orange spin button in the lower right corner of the screen.\nOther similar slot machines\nSilk Road Riches takes players into the era of overland travel, when the transport of goods from one end of the world to the other required ingenuity and muscle power. Leander Games has given this game a range of extra features and the dynamic payout system that makes each reel a dynamic zone in itself."

So we have a fun adventure with all this, plus a free bonus for spins and the choice for this or an instant win.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe game comes with a huge maximum payout prize of €30,000, but there are multiple big rewards that can be achieved even with a smaller bet. One of the game's features is the free spins. This bonus feature is activated by landing three yin yang symbols, however, the Marco Polo slots are one of the rarest games in the world whose wild symbol replaces the scatter/bonus. In this case, even two wilds can replace the bonus.\n\nDuring the bonus, if there are additional bonus symbols that appear as three, four or five per spin, the bonus feature will be replayed. In addition, there is a chance that the entire reel will be covered by the bonus symbol. In this case, players receive a 60x multiplier on all winnings up to that point.\n\nThe game's dynamic paytable reflects the symbol payment amounts based on the selected bet. If players win five matching Chinese coin symbols on a €3 bet, the prize will be €100. A prize of €50 is provided with five compasses and €25 with five of the open books.\n\nThe free spins feature comes with an incredible advantage. All wins receive a 2x multiplier, which is double the amount won, whether there are activated respins or not. The Marco Polo wild symbol replaces the yin yang symbol. But even before the game is launched, players can choose whether to collect instant wins or let free spins play out.\n\nThe game is easy to set up and there is no need to activate paylines, as all 30 are active at the same time. With a penny coin, the smallest bet on all these paylines is €0.30 per spin. There are many amounts that can be selected after this, up to the maximum limit of €30.00 per spin. The range of bets offers players many choices on which to build a gameplay and strategy for those who prefer to think in this way. That said, there are few other buttons that can have a say in the gaming experience.\n\nThe autoplay option allows players to choose one of the preset automatic spin numbers. There is no loss or win limit to set in the Marco Polo slot as there is in some other slot games, but this is fine because the highest number of spins is 100, so players just have to think about their balance or anticipate how this might play out. To make single spins, just use the orange spin button in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nSilk Road Riches takes players back to the era of mainland travel, when transporting goods from one end of the world to the other required cunning and muscle strength. Leander Games has given this game a series of extra features and the dynamic payment system that makes each reel a dynamic zone in its own right.\n            ",

Now you can relive Marco's adventure as you search for your own riches, and you will be well rewarded for finding themed objects along the way, including the letters and numbers that Marco Polo learned to communicate with the great Mongol warlord, as well as maps, treasure chests and Kublai Khan himself. You can also benefit from the Scatter and Wild camels that can offer free spins and prize multipliers that can make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.\n\nAnd you can start this adventure with very little in the bank, as bets start with just 1 coin per spin. This epic adventure is also perfect for playing on laptops and desktops.\n\nGraphics that take you on a journey to unexplored lands\n\nThere was a man whose writings influenced many other travelers during the Middle Ages. It was Marco Polo who went to China and rediscovered this civilization for the merchants and European travelers. This led to many new voyages, commerce and innovation. Certainly, the Marco Polo slot is not the only thing that immortalizes this extraordinary historical figure, as there are schools that bear his name, public squares and libraries. But his travels along the Silk Road led to the arrival of new products in Europe and vice versa. So we have a series of symbols that date back to that era in the Marco Polo slot machine made with the red rake.\n\nThis slot game has the standard five reels and three rows. The theme is obvious, as even the high card symbols resemble Chinese calligraphy, while the figure symbols are a compass, a Chinese coin, a handheld fan, a book and the Yin Yang symbol. The game has a long and comfortable range of bets and these work on the always active 30 paylines. So we have a fun adventure with all this, plus a free bonus for spins and the choice for this or an instant win.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe game comes with a huge maximum payout prize of €30,000, but there are multiple big rewards that can be achieved even with a smaller bet.

Now you can relive Marco's adventure as you search for your own riches, and you will be well rewarded for finding themed objects along the way, including the letters and numbers that Marco Polo learned to communicate with the great Mongol warlord, as well as maps, treasure chests and Kublai Khan himself. You can also benefit from the Scatter and Wild camels that can offer free spins and prize multipliers that can make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.\n\nAnd you can start this adventure with very little in the bank, as bets start with just 1 coin per spin. This epic adventure is also perfect for playing on laptops and desktops.\n\nGraphics that take you on a journey to unexplored lands\n\nThere was a man whose writings influenced many other travelers during the Middle Ages. It was Marco Polo who went to China and rediscovered this civilization for the merchants and European travelers. This led to many new voyages, commerce and innovation. Certainly, the Marco Polo slot is not the only thing that immortalizes this extraordinary historical figure, as there are schools that bear his name, public squares and libraries. But his travels along the Silk Road led to the arrival of new products in Europe and vice versa. So we have a series of symbols that date back to that era in the Marco Polo slot machine made with the red rake.\n\nThis slot game has the standard five reels and three rows. The theme is obvious, as even the high card symbols resemble Chinese calligraphy, while the figure symbols are a compass, a Chinese coin, a handheld fan, a book and the Yin Yang symbol. The game has a long and comfortable range of bets and these work on the always active 30 paylines. So we have a fun adventure with all this, plus a free bonus for spins and the choice for this or an instant win.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe game comes with a huge maximum payout prize of €30,000, but there are multiple big rewards that can be achieved even with a smaller bet. One of the game's features is the free spins. This bonus feature is activated by landing three yin yang symbols, however, the Marco Polo slots are one of the rarest games in the world whose wild symbol replaces the scatter/bonus. In this case, even two wilds can replace the bonus.\n\nDuring the bonus, if there are additional bonus symbols that appear as three, four or five per spin, the bonus feature will be replayed. In addition, there is a chance that the entire reel will be covered by the bonus symbol. In this case, players receive a 60x multiplier on all winnings up to that point.\n\nThe game's dynamic paytable reflects the symbol payment amounts based on the selected bet. If players win five matching Chinese coin symbols on a €3 bet, the prize will be €100. A prize of €50 is provided with five compasses and €25 with five of the open books.\n\nThe free spins feature comes with an incredible advantage. All wins receive a 2x multiplier, which is double the amount won, whether there are activated respins or not. The Marco Polo wild symbol replaces the yin yang symbol. But even before the game is launched, players can choose whether to collect instant wins or let free spins play out.\n\nThe game is easy to set up and there is no need to activate paylines, as all 30 are active at the same time. With a penny coin, the smallest bet on all these paylines is €0.30 per spin. There are many amounts that can be selected after this, up to the maximum limit of €30.00 per spin. The range of bets offers players many choices on which to build a gameplay and strategy for those who prefer to think in this way. That said, there are few other buttons that can have a say in the gaming experience.\n\nThe autoplay option allows players to choose one of the preset automatic spin numbers. There is no loss or win limit to set in the Marco Polo slot as there is in some other slot games, but this is fine because the highest number of spins is 100, so players just have to think about their balance or anticipate how this might play out. To make single spins, just use the orange spin button in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nSilk Road Riches takes players back to the era of mainland travel, when transporting goods from one end of the world to the other required cunning and muscle strength. Leander Games has given this game a series of extra features and the dynamic payment system that makes each reel a dynamic zone in its own right.\n            ",

Now you can relive Marco's adventure as you search for your own riches, and you will be well rewarded for finding themed objects along the way, including the letters and numbers that Marco Polo learned to communicate with the great Mongol warlord, as well as maps, treasure chests and Kublai Khan himself. You can also benefit from the Scatter and Wild camels that can offer free spins and prize multipliers that can make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.\n\nAnd you can start this adventure with very little in the bank, as bets start with just 1 coin per spin. This epic adventure is also perfect for playing on laptops and desktops.\n\nGraphics that take you on a journey to unexplored lands\n\nThere was a man whose writings influenced many other travelers during the Middle Ages. It was Marco Polo who went to China and rediscovered this civilization for the merchants and European travelers. This led to many new voyages, commerce and innovation. Certainly, the Marco Polo slot is not the only thing that immortalizes this extraordinary historical figure, as there are schools that bear his name, public squares and libraries. But his travels along the Silk Road led to the arrival of new products in Europe and vice versa. So we have a series of symbols that date back to that era in the Marco Polo slot machine made with the red rake.\n\nThis slot game has the standard five reels and three rows. The theme is obvious, as even the high card symbols resemble Chinese calligraphy, while the figure symbols are a compass, a Chinese coin, a handheld fan, a book and the Yin Yang symbol. The game has a long and comfortable range of bets and these work on the always active 30 paylines. So we have a fun adventure with all this, plus a free bonus for spins and the choice for this or an instant win.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe game comes with a huge maximum payout prize of €30,000, but there are multiple big rewards that can be achieved even with a smaller bet. One of the game's features is the free spins. This bonus feature is activated by landing three yin yang symbols, however, the Marco Polo slots are one of the rarest games in the world whose wild symbol replaces the scatter/bonus. In this case, even two wilds can replace the bonus.\n\nDuring the bonus, if there are additional bonus symbols that appear as three, four or five per spin, the bonus feature will be replayed. In addition, there is a chance that the entire reel will be covered by the bonus symbol. In this case, players receive a 60x multiplier on all winnings up to that point.\n\nThe game's dynamic paytable reflects the symbol payment amounts based on the selected bet. If players win five matching Chinese coin symbols on a €3 bet, the prize will be €100. A prize of €50 is provided with five compasses and €25 with five of the open books.\n\nThe free spins feature comes with an incredible advantage. All wins receive a 2x multiplier, which is double the amount won, whether there are activated respins or not. The Marco Polo wild symbol replaces the yin yang symbol. But even before the game is launched, players can choose whether to collect instant wins or let free spins play out.\n\nThe game is easy to set up and there is no need to activate paylines, as all 30 are active at the same time. With a penny coin, the smallest bet on all these paylines is €0.30 per spin. There are many amounts that can be selected after this, up to the maximum limit of €30.00 per spin. The range of bets offers players many choices on which to build a gameplay and strategy for those who prefer to think in this way. That said, there are few other buttons that can have a say in the gaming experience.\n\nThe autoplay option allows players to choose one of the preset automatic spin numbers. There is no loss or win limit to set in the Marco Polo slot as there is in some other slot games, but this is fine because the highest number of spins is 100, so players just have to think about their balance or anticipate how this might play out. To make single spins, just use the orange spin button in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nSilk Road Riches takes players back to the era of mainland travel, when transporting goods from one end of the world to the other required cunning and muscle strength. Leander Games has given this game a series of extra features and the dynamic payment system that makes each reel a dynamic zone in its own right.\n            ",
