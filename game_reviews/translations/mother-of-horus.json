This time, it's the free slot game \"Mother of Horus\" by Red Rake, featuring 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 ways to score winning combos. The plot revolves around the mighty goddess Isis and showcases some fantastic features. If I may, allow me to introduce you to this exhilarating slot game waiting to be played!\n\nMysterious gameplay and rich in history\n\nThe main scene depicts an ancient tomb where one can catch a glimpse of pyramids, trees, and the desert. The walls are drawn with hieroglyphics, and torches line the passageways. The soundtrack is a tad spooky, with a haunting wind blowing through the secret passages. The graphics are stunning, and the symbols are the classic protagonists of Ancient Egyptian slots. Some of these symbols include: \n\nRoyals\nPyramids\nTemples\nHorus and Osiris\n\nThe game has two wild symbols, Isis, and Nudge Wild as Scarab. To start playing, the minimum bet is €0.50, and the maximum is 35 coins per spin. The payouts are quite frequent until a maximum limit of 2,500 times the bet. Although the RTP is somewhat low at around 95.30%, game volatility is at a moderate level. \n\nLet Isis work her magic and enrich you!\n\nThis game has some truly original features. Let's explore them in detail:\n\nThe primary feature is the prize bar positioned above the reels and divided into 5 parts, one for each reel. There are Free Spins, a cash prize, or the Mini Roulette with a jackpot. They are triggered when Isis lands on a specific reel. During the base game, Isis can only appear on reels 1, 3, or 5.\nIsis, as previously mentioned, is the wild symbol that replaces all other symbols and forms various winning combinations.\nThe Wild Nudge can move across the reels and create new Wilds.\nThe game also has a Free Spins round activated by landing Isis on the reel marked with the Free Spins sign. Once activated, the player receives 10 Free Spins, and every time Isis appears on the marked reels, the player gets another 2 spins. During the round, the goddess can appear on all the reels instead of just 3 in the base game, creating several new opportunities.\nLast but not least, the Destiny Roulette mini-game is activated in the same way as the others. The number of spins on the roulette is determined by the number of wilds that activate it. The player has the chance to win a mini prize of 15x, a lesser one of 35x, a greater one of 100x, and a Grand prize of 500x the bet.\n\nExplore the enchanted temple of a goddess and win fantastic prizes.\n\nAll things considered, the free slot game \"Mother of Horus\" by Red Rake is one of the best games by Red Rake in our virtual library of video slots. The superb design accompanied by some very creative and exciting features that I briefly explained above are elements that convinced me to play this game, which also includes excellent payouts!

The game features 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 ways to score winning combos. The graphics are stunning, and the symbols are the classic protagonists of Ancient Egyptian slots. The game has two wild symbols, Isis, and Nudge Wild as Scarab. The primary feature is the prize bar positioned above the reels and divided into 5 parts, one for each reel. There are Free Spins, a cash prize, or the Mini Roulette with a jackpot. They are triggered when Isis lands on a specific reel. The game also has a Free Spins round activated by landing Isis on the reel marked with the Free Spins sign, and every time Isis appears, the player gets another 2 spins. Lastly, the Destiny Roulette mini-game is activated in the same way as the others.\n\nDesign and Graphics\n\nMother of Horus is set in an ancient tomb with stunning graphics. The walls are drawn with hieroglyphics, and torches line the passageways. The soundtrack is a tad spooky, with a haunting wind blowing through the secret passages. The symbols and the overall design are the classic protagonists of Ancient Egyptian slots, immersing players into the game's theme.\n\nPayouts and RTP\n\nThe game has moderate volatility, with quite frequent payouts until a maximum limit of 2,500 times the bet.

The minimum bet is €0.50, and the maximum is 35 coins per spin.\n\nJackpot and Bonus Features\n\nMother of Horus has several exciting bonus features, including Free Spins, a cash prize, and the Mini Roulette with a jackpot. Isis and Nudge Wild as Scarab are the two wild symbols in the game. The game's primary feature is the prize bar, where each reel has a specific prize like Free Spins or a cash prize or the Mini Roulette. The game also boasts a Free Spins round activated by landing Isis on the reel marked with the Free Spins sign, and every time Isis appears, the player gets another 2 spins. Lastly, the Destiny Roulette mini-game is activated in the same way as the others, and the player has the chance to win a mini prize of 15x, a lesser one of 35x, a greater one of 100x, and a Grand prize of 500x the bet.\n\nPersonal Opinion\n\nOverall, Mother of Horus is an excellent addition to Red Rake's collection of video slots. The game boasts stunning graphics and creative features centered around the goddess Isis. Although the RTP is somewhat low, the game has quite frequent payouts until a maximum limit of 2,500 times the bet.

This time, it's the free slot game \"Mother of Horus\" by Red Rake, featuring 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 ways to score winning combos. The plot revolves around the mighty goddess Isis and showcases some fantastic features. If I may, allow me to introduce you to this exhilarating slot game waiting to be played!\n\nMysterious gameplay and rich in history\n\nThe main scene depicts an ancient tomb where one can catch a glimpse of pyramids, trees, and the desert. The walls are drawn with hieroglyphics, and torches line the passageways. The soundtrack is a tad spooky, with a haunting wind blowing through the secret passages. The graphics are stunning, and the symbols are the classic protagonists of Ancient Egyptian slots. Some of these symbols include: \n\nRoyals\nPyramids\nTemples\nHorus and Osiris\n\nThe game has two wild symbols, Isis, and Nudge Wild as Scarab. To start playing, the minimum bet is €0.50, and the maximum is 35 coins per spin. The payouts are quite frequent until a maximum limit of 2,500 times the bet. Although the RTP is somewhat low at around 95.30%, game volatility is at a moderate level. \n\nLet Isis work her magic and enrich you!\n\nThis game has some truly original features. Let's explore them in detail:\n\nThe primary feature is the prize bar positioned above the reels and divided into 5 parts, one for each reel. There are Free Spins, a cash prize, or the Mini Roulette with a jackpot. They are triggered when Isis lands on a specific reel. During the base game, Isis can only appear on reels 1, 3, or 5.\nIsis, as previously mentioned, is the wild symbol that replaces all other symbols and forms various winning combinations.\nThe Wild Nudge can move across the reels and create new Wilds.\nThe game also has a Free Spins round activated by landing Isis on the reel marked with the Free Spins sign. Once activated, the player receives 10 Free Spins, and every time Isis appears on the marked reels, the player gets another 2 spins. During the round, the goddess can appear on all the reels instead of just 3 in the base game, creating several new opportunities.\nLast but not least, the Destiny Roulette mini-game is activated in the same way as the others. The number of spins on the roulette is determined by the number of wilds that activate it. The player has the chance to win a mini prize of 15x, a lesser one of 35x, a greater one of 100x, and a Grand prize of 500x the bet.\n\nExplore the enchanted temple of a goddess and win fantastic prizes.\n\nAll things considered, the free slot game \"Mother of Horus\" by Red Rake is one of the best games by Red Rake in our virtual library of video slots. The superb design accompanied by some very creative and exciting features that I briefly explained above are elements that convinced me to play this game, which also includes excellent payouts! So, it's worth giving it a shot.\n        ",
