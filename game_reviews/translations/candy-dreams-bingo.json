Evoplay has delighted us in the past with Candy Dreams, a candy-themed slot that quickly won the hearts of numerous players around the world. Just a few days ago, \"Candy Dreams: Bingo\" was launched on the market, which maintains the same theme and gameplay variations. We are certain that it will equal the success of its illustrious predecessor.\n\nThe graphics are an explosion of colors, with pink being the predominant one. In the background, you can see a square and a building with an Ice Cream sign on top. Strawberry and chocolate ice cream flows from the roof, complete with waffles. The game grid is in the center of the screen, with two other squares on the sides: one for the numbers drawn and the other for the paylines and their multipliers. At the bottom, you will find the play buttons. On the sound side, Evoplay did an excellent job, with a rhythmic tune that makes the plays cheerful and carefree.\n\nHow is Candy Dreams: Bingo played?\n\nNot being a slot in the strict sense of the word, we cannot talk about reels and rows. Instead, we have a container that can hold 25 numbers. The basic bet is 0.10 virtual coins, since the version illustrated here is just for demonstration purposes and does not involve real money. All combinations that develop horizontally, vertically, and diagonally are considered winning. The maximum win, with the applied multipliers, is 10,017 times the bet. For those who do not want to click continuously on the Start button, you can rely on the classic Autoplay function, where you can select from 10 to 100 automatic spins. You can have greater control over your winnings and losses by setting limits that stop the game when exceeded. The volatility is high, while the theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95.85%.\n\nThe gameplay mechanism is very simple. Each spin will land 25 numbers in the main grid and 40 in the right-hand square, all generated randomly. The corresponding numbers disappear, and in their place appears the ice cream symbol. When a combo of at least 5 symbols is formed, you win. Furthermore, the highest multiplier is applied to the first combinations formed, visible in the right-hand square. In this way, you can obtain a 25x, 100x, 250x multiplier, and up to a maximum of 10,000x!\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the RTP value?\n\nThe theoretical return to the player in this game is 95.85%.\n\nAre there any free spins in Candy Dreams: Bingo?\n\nNo, there are no special symbols, Wilds, or Scatters.\n\nCan I play Candy Dreams: Bingo on my smartphone?\n\nCertainly, the HTML5 architecture of this game allows you to play on any device, mobile, or fixed.\n            ",

Evoplay has delighted us in the past with Candy Dreams, a candy-themed slot that quickly won the hearts of numerous players around the world. Just a few days ago, \"Candy Dreams: Bingo\" was launched on the market, which maintains the same theme and gameplay variations. We are certain that it will equal the success of its illustrious predecessor.\n\nThe graphics are an explosion of colors, with pink being the predominant one. In the background, you can see a square and a building with an Ice Cream sign on top. Strawberry and chocolate ice cream flows from the roof, complete with waffles. The game grid is in the center of the screen, with two other squares on the sides: one for the numbers drawn and the other for the paylines and their multipliers. At the bottom, you will find the play buttons. On the sound side, Evoplay did an excellent job, with a rhythmic tune that makes the plays cheerful and carefree.\n\nHow is Candy Dreams: Bingo played?\n\nNot being a slot in the strict sense of the word, we cannot talk about reels and rows. Instead, we have a container that can hold 25 numbers. The basic bet is 0.10 virtual coins, since the version illustrated here is just for demonstration purposes and does not involve real money. All combinations that develop horizontally, vertically, and diagonally are considered winning. The maximum win, with the applied multipliers, is 10,017 times the bet. For those who do not want to click continuously on the Start button, you can rely on the classic Autoplay function, where you can select from 10 to 100 automatic spins. You can have greater control over your winnings and losses by setting limits that stop the game when exceeded. The volatility is high, while the theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95.85%.\n\nThe gameplay mechanism is very simple. Each spin will land 25 numbers in the main grid and 40 in the right-hand square, all generated randomly. The corresponding numbers disappear, and in their place appears the ice cream symbol. When a combo of at least 5 symbols is formed, you win. Furthermore, the highest multiplier is applied to the first combinations formed, visible in the right-hand square. In this way, you can obtain a 25x, 100x, 250x multiplier, and up to a maximum of 10,000x!\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the RTP value?\n\nThe theoretical return to the player in this game is 95.85%.\n\nAre there any free spins in Candy Dreams: Bingo?\n\nNo, there are no special symbols, Wilds, or Scatters.\n\nCan I play Candy Dreams: Bingo on my smartphone?\n\nCertainly, the HTML5 architecture of this game allows you to play on any device, mobile, or fixed.\n        ",
