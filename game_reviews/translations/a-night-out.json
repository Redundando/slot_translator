Fun, beautiful girls, and cocktails are chosen as symbols of the gameplay, perfectly in line with the \"vida loca\" style. Who wouldn't want to spend an evening with friends in the heart of the city and have a wild time? This machine helps you do just that with its 5 reels and 20 paylines, relying heavily on simple and somewhat retro graphics. As soon as the game starts, you're transported back in time, specifically to the 80s. This game has an impressive RTP of 97.06%, above the average for the online gambling market. Let's take a look at its features and strengths, keeping in mind that it doesn't have a progressive jackpot, which means you can't win big dream payouts.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nGraphics aren't necessarily the strength of this slot game if you're expecting something innovative and modern, and this extends to its animations. Playtech decided to keep the game board clean and simple to focus on the spins of the reels. Is this where the big game-changing moments happen? Yes, we can say that. It's important to find the Wild, that is the Beer Mug; this is the symbol that will help you win more. It has the power to substitute every other symbol, generating wins that will thrill you. The same goes for the Scatter, which is the Dancefloor icon that helps to multiply your wins. If you find at least three, you can get up to 5 times your bet, while if you find four, your winnings will be multiplied by 10x. However, the big hit comes if you find five Scatter symbols in one spin: the multiplier soars to 50x, giving you a chance to win a significant payout.\n\nOther than the special symbols we've mentioned, let's not forget the bonus symbol of the bartender and the sexy dancing girl. If you manage to align two bartenders on one reel, you'll see six playful girls created in a cartoon style. The player gets to choose one of them to get the corresponding prize, which is a certain number of free spins. But that's not the only choice you'll be asked to make - what do you say to a nice drink? Choose carefully, because you can win a multiplier that matches the spins and dramatically increases your winnings.\n\nFinal thoughts on A Night Out slot\nIn summary, A Night Out probably won't be remembered for its graphics and animation choices that accompany the spins of the reels. However, its retro effect and vintage spirit could attract a specific category of players who not only know and love this developer, but who seek something very specific. It's true, however, that the game lacks a good variety of features, which is made up for by its good playability. As an experienced gambler, you'll enjoy the gameplay of this slot game, even though it doesn't have a progressive jackpot.\n            ",

Fun, beautiful girls, and cocktails are chosen as symbols of the gameplay, perfectly in line with the \"vida loca\" style. Who wouldn't want to spend an evening with friends in the heart of the city and have a wild time? This machine helps you do just that with its 5 reels and 20 paylines, relying heavily on simple and somewhat retro graphics. As soon as the game starts, you're transported back in time, specifically to the 80s. This game has an impressive RTP of 97.06%, above the average for the online gambling market. Let's take a look at its features and strengths, keeping in mind that it doesn't have a progressive jackpot, which means you can't win big dream payouts.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nGraphics aren't necessarily the strength of this slot game if you're expecting something innovative and modern, and this extends to its animations. Playtech decided to keep the game board clean and simple to focus on the spins of the reels. Is this where the big game-changing moments happen? Yes, we can say that. It's important to find the Wild, that is the Beer Mug; this is the symbol that will help you win more. It has the power to substitute every other symbol, generating wins that will thrill you. The same goes for the Scatter, which is the Dancefloor icon that helps to multiply your wins. If you find at least three, you can get up to 5 times your bet, while if you find four, your winnings will be multiplied by 10x. However, the big hit comes if you find five Scatter symbols in one spin: the multiplier soars to 50x, giving you a chance to win a significant payout.\n\nOther than the special symbols we've mentioned, let's not forget the bonus symbol of the bartender and the sexy dancing girl. If you manage to align two bartenders on one reel, you'll see six playful girls created in a cartoon style. The player gets to choose one of them to get the corresponding prize, which is a certain number of free spins. But that's not the only choice you'll be asked to make - what do you say to a nice drink? Choose carefully, because you can win a multiplier that matches the spins and dramatically increases your winnings.\n\nFinal thoughts on A Night Out slot\nIn summary, A Night Out probably won't be remembered for its graphics and animation choices that accompany the spins of the reels. However, its retro effect and vintage spirit could attract a specific category of players who not only know and love this developer, but who seek something very specific. It's true, however, that the game lacks a good variety of features, which is made up for by its good playability. As an experienced gambler, you'll enjoy the gameplay of this slot game, even though it doesn't have a progressive jackpot.\n            ",

The same goes for the Scatter, which is the Dancefloor icon that helps to multiply your wins. If you find at least three, you can get up to 5 times your bet, while if you find four, your winnings will be multiplied by 10x. However, the big hit comes if you find five Scatter symbols in one spin: the multiplier soars to 50x, giving you a chance to win a significant payout.\n\nOther than the special symbols we've mentioned, let's not forget the bonus symbol of the bartender and the sexy dancing girl. If you manage to align two bartenders on one reel, you'll see six playful girls created in a cartoon style. The player gets to choose one of them to get the corresponding prize, which is a certain number of free spins. But that's not the only choice you'll be asked to make - what do you say to a nice drink? Choose carefully, because you can win a multiplier that matches the spins and dramatically increases your winnings.\n\nFinal thoughts on A Night Out slot\nIn summary, A Night Out probably won't be remembered for its graphics and animation choices that accompany the spins of the reels. However, its retro effect and vintage spirit could attract a specific category of players who not only know and love this developer, but who seek something very specific. It's true, however, that the game lacks a good variety of features, which is made up for by its good playability. As an experienced gambler, you'll enjoy the gameplay of this slot game, even though it doesn't have a progressive jackpot.\n            ",

Fun, beautiful girls, and cocktails are chosen as symbols of the gameplay, perfectly in line with the \"vida loca\" style. Who wouldn't want to spend an evening with friends in the heart of the city and have a wild time? This machine helps you do just that with its 5 reels and 20 paylines, relying heavily on simple and somewhat retro graphics. As soon as the game starts, you're transported back in time, specifically to the 80s. This game has an impressive RTP of 97.06%, above the average for the online gambling market. Let's take a look at its features and strengths, keeping in mind that it doesn't have a progressive jackpot, which means you can't win big dream payouts.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nGraphics aren't necessarily the strength of this slot game if you're expecting something innovative and modern, and this extends to its animations. Playtech decided to keep the game board clean and simple to focus on the spins of the reels. Is this where the big game-changing moments happen? Yes, we can say that. It's important to find the Wild, that is the Beer Mug; this is the symbol that will help you win more. It has the power to substitute every other symbol, generating wins that will thrill you. The same goes for the Scatter, which is the Dancefloor icon that helps to multiply your wins. If you find at least three, you can get up to 5 times your bet, while if you find four, your winnings will be multiplied by 10x. However, the big hit comes if you find five Scatter symbols in one spin: the multiplier soars to 50x, giving you a chance to win a significant payout.\n\nOther than the special symbols we've mentioned, let's not forget the bonus symbol of the bartender and the sexy dancing girl.
