Cash Falls Island Bounty, the slot produced by Light & Wonder, is set on a Caribbean beach, with light waves crashing on the shore and mountains rich in vegetation emerging from the crystal-clear water. The game grid is positioned on a wooden structure where we usually find the menus of beach bars, a short distance away there is an open oyster from which jewels and valuables emerge, and on the left four boxes indicating the jackpots.\n\nThe graphics are very minimal, without frills or animations, but with a fun and dynamic gameplay.\n\nFeatures of Cash Falls Island Bounty\n\nThe game grid has 5 reels and variable rows, according to the following scheme: 4-4-6-6-8. There are 4,608 ways to win, and the bet starts from a minimum of €0.10 and can go up to a maximum of €50. \n\nTo speed up the rotation of the reels, players can activate the Turbo by adjusting the slider of the seashell, so that the symbols fall faster, or activate Autoplay, choosing a variable number of automatic spins.\n\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.92%.\n\nHow to Win at Cash Falls Island Bounty\n\nThe core of the game is represented by the coin system which we will see shortly, but first let's focus on the symbols and their value. The playing cards from Jack to Ace are the ones that are worth the least, while higher sums are obtained thanks to the starfish, crab, and dolphin. If you want an accurate estimate of the value of the symbols, we suggest accessing the paytable from within the game.\n\nNow let's take a look at the special symbols: the yacht is the Wild symbol that can complete a combo when a regular symbol is missing.\n\nThe second special symbol is the Scatter coin that always lands accompanied by a multiplier, and remains in place for the next 3 spins. If the entire reel is filled with Scatters, then the Cash Falls function is activated, which assigns a sum equal to the total of the multipliers shown on the reel.\n\nIf the coin appears accompanied by Mini, Minor, Major, or Mega instead of the multiplier, and the entire reel is filled, then the corresponding jackpot is won.\n\nThe bonfire is another Scatter symbol. At least 3 are needed to get a variable number of free spins, during which the only symbols allowed are the Scatter coins and their respective multipliers. At the top of the reel, there will be a silver Scatter coin with a question mark in the center that will reveal a random multiplier to be added to all the others at the end of the function.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow can I get the Bonus game in Cash Falls Island Bounty?\n\nThere are two ways: the first is to hope that at least 3 Scatters land on the reels, the second is to buy the function using the appropriate button on the screen.\n\nHow many ways to win are there?\n\nIn Cash Falls Island Bounty, there are 4,608 ways to win.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player (RTP)?\n\nCash Falls Island Bounty has an RTP of 95.92%.\n            ",

Cash Falls Island Bounty, the slot produced by Light & Wonder, is set on a Caribbean beach, with light waves crashing on the shore and mountains rich in vegetation emerging from the crystal-clear water. The game grid is positioned on a wooden structure where we usually find the menus of beach bars, a short distance away there is an open oyster from which jewels and valuables emerge, and on the left four boxes indicating the jackpots.\n\nThe graphics are very minimal, without frills or animations, but with a fun and dynamic gameplay.\n\nFeatures of Cash Falls Island Bounty\n\nThe game grid has 5 reels and variable rows, according to the following scheme: 4-4-6-6-8. There are 4,608 ways to win, and the bet starts from a minimum of €0.10 and can go up to a maximum of €50. \n\nTo speed up the rotation of the reels, players can activate the Turbo by adjusting the slider of the seashell, so that the symbols fall faster, or activate Autoplay, choosing a variable number of automatic spins.\n\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.92%.\n\nHow to Win at Cash Falls Island Bounty\n\nThe core of the game is represented by the coin system which we will see shortly, but first let's focus on the symbols and their value. The playing cards from Jack to Ace are the ones that are worth the least, while higher sums are obtained thanks to the starfish, crab, and dolphin. If you want an accurate estimate of the value of the symbols, we suggest accessing the paytable from within the game.\n\nNow let's take a look at the special symbols: the yacht is the Wild symbol that can complete a combo when a regular symbol is missing.\n\nThe second special symbol is the Scatter coin that always lands accompanied by a multiplier, and remains in place for the next 3 spins. If the entire reel is filled with Scatters, then the Cash Falls function is activated, which assigns a sum equal to the total of the multipliers shown on the reel.\n\nIf the coin appears accompanied by Mini, Minor, Major, or Mega instead of the multiplier, and the entire reel is filled, then the corresponding jackpot is won.\n\nThe bonfire is another Scatter symbol. At least 3 are needed to get a variable number of free spins, during which the only symbols allowed are the Scatter coins and their respective multipliers. At the top of the reel, there will be a silver Scatter coin with a question mark in the center that will reveal a random multiplier to be added to all the others at the end of the function.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow can I get the Bonus game in Cash Falls Island Bounty?\n\nThere are two ways: the first is to hope that at least 3 Scatters land on the reels, the second is to buy the function using the appropriate button on the screen.\n\nHow many ways to win are there?\n\nIn Cash Falls Island Bounty, there are 4,608 ways to win.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player (RTP)?\n\nCash Falls Island Bounty has an RTP of 95.92%.\n            ",

With 4,608 ways to win, the game is set on a Caribbean beach with a wooden structure that holds the game grid. The slot has a high volatility with the theoretical return to player (RTP) at 95.92%. Players can activate Turbo or Autoplay to speed up the reels.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nThe game features 10 regular symbols, with playing cards from Jack to Ace being the lowest paying symbols. The highest paying symbols are the starfish, crab, and dolphin. The yacht symbol is the Wild, which can be substituted for any other symbol to form a winning combination. The Scatter coin is accompanied by a multiplier and remains in place for the next 3 spins. If the entire reel is filled with Scatters, then the Cash Falls function is activated, which awards a sum equal to the total of the multipliers shown on the reel. If the coin appears with Mini, Minor, Major, or Mega instead of the multiplier, and the entire reel is filled, then the corresponding jackpot is won. The bonfire symbol is another Scatter symbol that awards a variable number of free spins, during which the only symbols allowed are the Scatter coins and their respective multipliers.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nCash Falls Island Bounty has minimal graphics without frills or animations, but with a fun and dynamic gameplay. The game is set on a Caribbean beach, with light waves crashing on the shore and mountains rich in vegetation emerging from the crystal-clear water. The game grid is positioned on a wooden structure where players might usually find the menus of beach bars. The sound effects are basic but appropriate for the theme of the game.\n\nBetting and Jackpots\n\nThe minimum bet starts from €0.10 and can go up to a maximum of €50. The game has four jackpots, which are Mini, Minor, Major, and Mega. Players can win the jackpots by filling an entire reel with the corresponding symbol. The value of each jackpot increases as players place bigger bets.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nCash Falls Island Bounty has a high volatility with the theoretical return to player (RTP) at 95.92%. This means that the game might not see regular wins, but when wins do occur, they are usually big. Players should keep in mind that this value is theoretical, and the actual RTP may differ over a long gaming session.\n\n        \n            ",

Cash Falls Island Bounty, the slot produced by Light & Wonder, is set on a Caribbean beach, with light waves crashing on the shore and mountains rich in vegetation emerging from the crystal-clear water. The game grid is positioned on a wooden structure where we usually find the menus of beach bars, a short distance away there is an open oyster from which jewels and valuables emerge, and on the left four boxes indicating the jackpots.\n\nThe graphics are very minimal, without frills or animations, but with a fun and dynamic gameplay.\n\nFeatures of Cash Falls Island Bounty\n\nThe game grid has 5 reels and variable rows, according to the following scheme: 4-4-6-6-8. There are 4,608 ways to win, and the bet starts from a minimum of €0.10 and can go up to a maximum of €50. \n\nTo speed up the rotation of the reels, players can activate the Turbo by adjusting the slider of the seashell, so that the symbols fall faster, or activate Autoplay, choosing a variable number of automatic spins.\n\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.92%.\n\nHow to Win at Cash Falls Island Bounty\n\nThe core of the game is represented by the coin system which we will see shortly, but first let's focus on the symbols and their value. The playing cards from Jack to Ace are the ones that are worth the least, while higher sums are obtained thanks to the starfish, crab, and dolphin. If you want an accurate estimate of the value of the symbols, we suggest accessing the paytable from within the game.\n\nNow let's take a look at the special symbols: the yacht is the Wild symbol that can complete a combo when a regular symbol is missing.\n\nThe second special symbol is the Scatter coin that always lands accompanied by a multiplier, and remains in place for the next 3 spins. If the entire reel is filled with Scatters, then the Cash Falls function is activated, which assigns a sum equal to the total of the multipliers shown on the reel.\n\nIf the coin appears accompanied by Mini, Minor, Major, or Mega instead of the multiplier, and the entire reel is filled, then the corresponding jackpot is won.\n\nThe bonfire is another Scatter symbol. At least 3 are needed to get a variable number of free spins, during which the only symbols allowed are the Scatter coins and their respective multipliers. At the top of the reel, there will be a silver Scatter coin with a question mark in the center that will reveal a random multiplier to be added to all the others at the end of the function.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow can I get the Bonus game in Cash Falls Island Bounty?\n\nThere are two ways: the first is to hope that at least 3 Scatters land on the reels, the second is to buy the function using the appropriate button on the screen.\n\nHow many ways to win are there?\n\nIn Cash Falls Island Bounty, there are 4,608 ways to win.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player (RTP)?\n\nCash Falls Island Bounty has an RTP of 95.92%.\n            ",

Cash Falls Island Bounty, the slot produced by Light & Wonder, is set on a Caribbean beach, with light waves crashing on the shore and mountains rich in vegetation emerging from the crystal-clear water. The game grid is positioned on a wooden structure where we usually find the menus of beach bars, a short distance away there is an open oyster from which jewels and valuables emerge, and on the left four boxes indicating the jackpots.\n\nThe graphics are very minimal, without frills or animations, but with a fun and dynamic gameplay.\n\nFeatures of Cash Falls Island Bounty\n\nThe game grid has 5 reels and variable rows, according to the following scheme: 4-4-6-6-8. There are 4,608 ways to win, and the bet starts from a minimum of €0.10 and can go up to a maximum of €50. \n\nTo speed up the rotation of the reels, players can activate the Turbo by adjusting the slider of the seashell, so that the symbols fall faster, or activate Autoplay, choosing a variable number of automatic spins.\n\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.92%.\n\nHow to Win at Cash Falls Island Bounty\n\nThe core of the game is represented by the coin system which we will see shortly, but first let's focus on the symbols and their value. The playing cards from Jack to Ace are the ones that are worth the least, while higher sums are obtained thanks to the starfish, crab, and dolphin. If you want an accurate estimate of the value of the symbols, we suggest accessing the paytable from within the game.\n\nNow let's take a look at the special symbols: the yacht is the Wild symbol that can complete a combo when a regular symbol is missing.\n\nThe second special symbol is the Scatter coin that always lands accompanied by a multiplier, and remains in place for the next 3 spins. If the entire reel is filled with Scatters, then the Cash Falls function is activated, which assigns a sum equal to the total of the multipliers shown on the reel.\n\nIf the coin appears accompanied by Mini, Minor, Major, or Mega instead of the multiplier, and the entire reel is filled, then the corresponding jackpot is won.\n\nThe bonfire is another Scatter symbol. At least 3 are needed to get a variable number of free spins, during which the only symbols allowed are the Scatter coins and their respective multipliers. At the top of the reel, there will be a silver Scatter coin with a question mark in the center that will reveal a random multiplier to be added to all the others at the end of the function.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow can I get the Bonus game in Cash Falls Island Bounty?\n\nThere are two ways: the first is to hope that at least 3 Scatters land on the reels, the second is to buy the function using the appropriate button on the screen.\n\nHow many ways to win are there?\n\nIn Cash Falls Island Bounty, there are 4,608 ways to win.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player (RTP)?\n\nCash Falls Island Bounty has an RTP of 95.92%.\n            ",
