La slot, con il suo RTP al 95,7% ha una grafica standard che prevede rulli con una struttura di 5×4 e solo 10 linee attive. Offre fino a 4.825 volte la puntata con l’uso di simboli Scatter, simboli con i pesci e la possibilità di collezionare giri gratuiti. Il tutto considerando un range di scommessa che va da 0,10 a 20 monete.\nGrafica e caratteristiche della slot\nLa grafica è molto interessante e mantiene sempre lo stile di questo provider che sa studiare in modo perfetto le immagini del gioco. Si apre il gioco e veniamo catapultati sott’acqua, alle prese con un vivace universo marino:  e proprio lì a bordo della sua barca troviamo il nostro pescatore pronto a entrare in azione. A volte proprio lui abbasserà il suo amo su una delle file del gioco, consentendo di raccogliere tutti i pesci posizionati. Si tratta di una funzione bonus che, se non porta a una vittoria, porterà il suo amo a spostarsi su un’altra linea di gioco.\nBonus game e funzionalità \nSono numerose le funzionalità di Bass Boss, ma quella da cui è giusto partire è proprio la raccolta pesci di cui parlavamo poco fa: i tipi di pesci che offrono premi possono pagare da 5 volte fino a 15 volte la scommessa. Ma il tuo obiettivo è di trovare lo scorfano (paga fino a 50 volte) o il pesce rosso che raggiunge 200 volte la tua scommessa. Controlla anche l’eventuale presenza di un moltiplicatore fino a 10 volte per rendere ancora più vivace il gioco.\nE ovviamente non potevano mancare i giri gratuiti del nostro pescatore: con 3 o più simboli Scatter in un singolo round sblocchi questa funzionalità che mette in palio i tuoi free spin. Anche in questo caso resta il gioco dell’amo su uno dei livelli di gioco: più pesci vai a raccogliere e maggiore è il livello della funzione che porta il moltiplicatore fino a 10x.\n\nFAQ: Le risposte alle domande più frequenti \nPosso giocare gratuitamente anche da smartphone?\n\nCerto, trovi la slot proprio nel nostro sito e anche su casinò online che offrono la funzionalità For Fun, per provarla in versione demo, senza denaro reale.\n\n\n\nQual è l'RTP della slot?\n\nIl valore del ritorno al giocatore di Bass Boss è pari al 95,70%, poco sotto la media delle slot online.\n\n\n\nC’è un modo per vincere su Bass Boss?\n\nQuesta è una slot di divertimento, come tutte le altre e proprio per questo non esistono miracoli, ma si affida unicamente alla fortuna.

With its modern design and interesting twists in the gameplay, this 5x4 reels game with 10 active lines offers an RTP of 95.7%. The main goal is to catch as many fish as possible on the reels, with different reward amounts paid based on fish type. The scorpionfish and red fish offer the highest payouts, reaching up to 50 and 200 times the bet, respectively. Additionally, the game also offers a chance to collect free spins with a multiplier of up to 10x. \n\nThe graphics in Bass Boss are visually stunning and perfectly aligned with the aquatic environment. The fisherman, who operates from a small boat, is always ready to start the fishing experience and activate the various features present in the game. Among these features is the fish collection game, where catching fish brings bonus rewards. When the hook drops on a line and collects fish, the function moves to another line, giving players more chances to collect rewards. \n\nOverall, Bass Boss is a thrilling slot game with interesting features and exciting gameplay. Players can access it on various online casinos that offer the demo version for those who wish to play without placing real money bets. Remember though, as with all slot games, the outcome is subject to chance, and no guaranteed wins exist.\n        ",

The game features different types of fish, which all have different prize values, as well as classic card symbols. And the best part? You don't even have to feel guilty about catching too many fish, which can't always be said about real-life fishing!</p><p>But wait, there's more! The game offers free spins that can be triggered by landing three or more scatter symbols - and who doesn't love free spins? And the engaging bonus game adds even more excitement to the gameplay. Players can select from different fishing spots to try and catch the most valuable fish - just like in real fishing. Except in Bass Boss, you won't have to worry about getting seasick, losing your bait, or having a fish get away right before you reel it in.</p><p>All in all, Bass Boss is a solid online slot game for everyone who loves fishing, or just wants to enjoy a fun, low-key game with decent payouts. And remember - if you don't like the results of your last spin, you can always blame it on the one that got away.</p>"
