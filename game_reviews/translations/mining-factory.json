Starting this way may not seem particularly alluring, but we're not talking about hard work, rather a remote gaming solution that can make your bets more interesting. Enter this mine and get to work to achieve your most prestigious winnings. You can do it thanks to an idea developed by TrueLabs, who decided to launch a 3x5 reel video slot with 27 paylines with a rather unusual theme, which has also been developed in a way that is hard to imagine. Starting with its RTP at 96.1%, in line with the industry average, we will not only discover its richest symbols, but above all its features. Through the features, in fact, as you will understand, different winnings can be unlocked that can attribute higher prizes.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nIts graphic appearance is curious: Mining Factory reflects the style of this provider who has accustomed players to a series of titles with a varied gameplay, but which can also offer a respectable aesthetic touch. It is a solution easy enough to try, with more rewarding bonus and special symbols. For example, we think of the green clover, which has always been the true essence of luck, a mechanical bug, and the Wild. The idea of introducing the Bitcoin symbol is cute, presenting the icon of money through the famous cryptocurrency that has been talked about so much in recent months.\n\nIt must be said that while presenting a simple mechanics, it is not exactly the most intuitive choice you can make. It will take time and a few test spins to find the right level of confidence with the gameplay: for this reason, you can try your gaming techniques on our platform.\n\nSpecial features\nThere are several ways to achieve more important winnings: obviously, the features must be unlocked. Let's think of the Scatter symbol, i.e. the mechanical scarab that can appear on all reels during the base game. If you match three, you will have three free spins, with four you will have six spins, and with five you will land 12. When this phase is activated, the player can obtain the expanding Wilds that are ideal for winning rich prizes.\n\nBut that's not all: watch out for the energy symbol that on one hand gives a coin prize but can above all influence the Power Spin jackpot. If you reach 100 energy units, you can activate it and let yourself be carried away by the feature.\n\nFinal considerations on the Mining Factory slot\nIf it is true that the work done by TrueLabs, as announced by its team, is to make the remote gaming sector even more special, we can say that the mission is accomplished.

It may not sound very enticing, but we're not talking about hard work here. We're talking about a remote gaming solution that could pique your interest. Enter this mine and work your way to conquering your most prestigious wins. TrueLabs has developed an idea that has decided to launch a 3x5 reel video slot with 27 paylines with an unusual theme that has also been developed in an unimaginable way. Starting from its RTP at 96.1%, in line with industry standards, we will discover not only its richest symbols, but above all its features. Through these features, as you will discover, you will unlock various wins that can attribute higher prizes.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nIts graphic appearance is curious: Mining Factory reflects the best of this provider's style that has accustomed players to a series of titles with varied gameplay, but can also offer a respectable aesthetic touch. It is an easy enough solution to try, with more rewarding and special bonus symbols. Let's think, for example, of the green clover, which has always been the essence of true luck, a mechanical insect and the wild symbol. The idea of introducing the Bitcoin symbol is nice, as it presents the money icon through the famous cryptocurrency that has been talked about so much in recent months. It should be said that although presenting a simple mechanic, it is not the most intuitive choice you can make. It will take time and a few test spins to find the right level of confidence with the gameplay. For this reason, you can try your gaming techniques on our platform. But your goal is only one: to focus on the personal control panel and fixed paylines that allow you to establish your bet.\n\nSpecial features\n\nThere are several ways to achieve more significant wins: obviously the features must be unlocked. Let's think of the scatter symbol, or the mechanical beetle that can appear on all reels during the base game. If you match three, you'll get three free spins, with four you'll get six spins, and with five, you'll land 12. When this phase is activated, the player can get expanding wilds that are ideal for winning very rich prizes. But that's not all: keep an eye on the energy symbol that not only gives a coin prize but can also influence the Power Spin jackpot. If you get to 100 energy units, you can activate it and be carried away by the function.\n\nFinal thoughts on the slot Mining Factory\n\nIf it is true that TrueLabs' work, as announced by its team, is to make the remote gaming sector even more special, we can say that the mission is accomplished. In this case, the idea and its realization are good, particular, and attractive to different types of players. It should be said that after trying it, we noticed that it is a little slow as gameplay, although it has the right dose of bonuses that can make the adventure interesting. For experienced players, this slot game offers the perfect balance of strategy and excitement to keep you entertained for hours on end.\n            ",

It may not sound very enticing, but we're not talking about hard work here. We're talking about a remote gaming solution that could pique your interest. Enter this mine and work your way to conquering your most prestigious wins. TrueLabs has developed an idea that has decided to launch a 3x5 reel video slot with 27 paylines with an unusual theme that has also been developed in an unimaginable way. Starting from its RTP at 96.1%, in line with industry standards, we will discover not only its richest symbols, but above all its features. Through these features, as you will discover, you will unlock various wins that can attribute higher prizes.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nIts graphic appearance is curious: Mining Factory reflects the best of this provider's style that has accustomed players to a series of titles with varied gameplay, but can also offer a respectable aesthetic touch. It is an easy enough solution to try, with more rewarding and special bonus symbols. Let's think, for example, of the green clover, which has always been the essence of true luck, a mechanical insect and the wild symbol. The idea of introducing the Bitcoin symbol is nice, as it presents the money icon through the famous cryptocurrency that has been talked about so much in recent months. It should be said that although presenting a simple mechanic, it is not the most intuitive choice you can make. It will take time and a few test spins to find the right level of confidence with the gameplay. For this reason, you can try your gaming techniques on our platform. But your goal is only one: to focus on the personal control panel and fixed paylines that allow you to establish your bet.\n\nSpecial features\n\nThere are several ways to achieve more significant wins: obviously the features must be unlocked. Let's think of the scatter symbol, or the mechanical beetle that can appear on all reels during the base game. If you match three, you'll get three free spins, with four you'll get six spins, and with five, you'll land 12. When this phase is activated, the player can get expanding wilds that are ideal for winning very rich prizes. But that's not all: keep an eye on the energy symbol that not only gives a coin prize but can also influence the Power Spin jackpot. If you get to 100 energy units, you can activate it and be carried away by the function.\n\nFinal thoughts on the slot Mining Factory\n\nIf it is true that TrueLabs' work, as announced by its team, is to make the remote gaming sector even more special, we can say that the mission is accomplished. In this case, the idea and its realization are good, particular, and attractive to different types of players. It should be said that after trying it, we noticed that it is a little slow as gameplay, although it has the right dose of bonuses that can make the adventure interesting. For experienced players, this slot game offers the perfect balance of strategy and excitement to keep you entertained for hours on end.\n            ",
