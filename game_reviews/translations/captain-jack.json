Conta 5 rulli e le 20 payline che vedono alternarsi un vasto numero di figure e simboli speciali. E quali possono essere visto che parliamo di un contesto piratesco?

Il bonus spin offre solo 3 giri, che è altamente al di sotto della media; è anche vero per che potranno essere riattivati fino a 20. E inoltre viene aggiunto anche il bonus game che permette di moltiplicare le giocate effettuate così da aumentare il premio finale. In questo caso è necessario che si posizionino almeno 3 simboli della Mappa ma solo sui rulli 2, 3 e 4.

Let's talk about an online slot machine that takes the pirate theme and develops a series of bonuses and features that will attract numerous players. Captain Jack is one of the most curious titles ever produced by the software house Tuko. And as proud supporters of made in Italy, we couldn't help but review it!\n\nWe don't find the much-awaited Jack Sparrow, but an old pirate who is alone on a deserted island, where he is called upon to protect treasures that have been hidden for years. It's clear that his intention is not to share his fortune, but it's up to the player to find the right key (with a touch of luck) to activate  bonuses and extra features to steal his loot. Below, we will discover the technical and graphic characteristics of this slot machine, as well as all the quirks that make it so much fun!\n\nGraphics and Gameplay Features\nThe Captain Jack slot has a simple yet beautiful graphics, so attentive it even presents 3D animations. It has 5 reels and 20 pay lines that alternate a large number of figures and special symbols. And what can be expected from a pirate context situation? We have a flag complete with a Skull, a Sword, an Anchor, a Chest, a Cannon, a Helm, and much more. Among the special symbols, we have the unmissable Wilds and Scatters. The first, the game's wildcard, is represented by the Treasure Chest, which can help players obtain lucky combinations with its alignment on the game board. It can take on the value of any other icon but not the Scatter. This is represented by the Flag with the Skull, which has a special task: it must activate free spins, or it can also offer multipliers compared to the standard bet. It's necessary, however, for it to position itself on the reels, anywhere, at least for three symbols. Unfortunately, we found a small sore note here: compared to many other slots, it has a limited number of spins. The bonus spin offers only three spins, which is highly below average, but it is also true that these spins can be reactivated up to 20 times. A bonus game is added that allows players to multiply the bets made to increase the final prize. In this case, it's necessary to position at least three symbols of the Map but only on reels 2, 3, and 4. At that point, you can participate in a real treasure hunt: eight chests will appear on the screen in front of you, which you must open to collect the prize.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Captain Jack Slot\nThe testing phase of this online machine is generally positive, and the experience is not disappointing at all. The game requires a minimum bet of 0.02 cents and can go up to 20 euros. The default bet is set at €0.2 with the possibility of using one coin per pay line. We have 20 pay lines and a maximum number of free spins equal to three. The percentage of return to the player in winnings reaches 96.35%. As an experienced gambler, one can look forward to the exciting gameplay and bonuses offered by Captain Jack.\n            ",

Let's talk about an online slot machine that takes the pirate theme and develops a series of bonuses and features that will attract numerous players. Captain Jack is one of the most curious titles ever produced by the software house Tuko. And as proud supporters of made in Italy, we couldn't help but review it!\n\nWe don't find the much-awaited Jack Sparrow, but an old pirate who is alone on a deserted island, where he is called upon to protect treasures that have been hidden for years. It's clear that his intention is not to share his fortune, but it's up to the player to find the right key (with a touch of luck) to activate  bonuses and extra features to steal his loot. Below, we will discover the technical and graphic characteristics of this slot machine, as well as all the quirks that make it so much fun!\n\nGraphics and Gameplay Features\nThe Captain Jack slot has a simple yet beautiful graphics, so attentive it even presents 3D animations. It has 5 reels and 20 pay lines that alternate a large number of figures and special symbols. And what can be expected from a pirate context situation? We have a flag complete with a Skull, a Sword, an Anchor, a Chest, a Cannon, a Helm, and much more. Among the special symbols, we have the unmissable Wilds and Scatters. The first, the game's wildcard, is represented by the Treasure Chest, which can help players obtain lucky combinations with its alignment on the game board. It can take on the value of any other icon but not the Scatter. This is represented by the Flag with the Skull, which has a special task: it must activate free spins, or it can also offer multipliers compared to the standard bet. It's necessary, however, for it to position itself on the reels, anywhere, at least for three symbols. Unfortunately, we found a small sore note here: compared to many other slots, it has a limited number of spins. The bonus spin offers only three spins, which is highly below average, but it is also true that these spins can be reactivated up to 20 times. A bonus game is added that allows players to multiply the bets made to increase the final prize. In this case, it's necessary to position at least three symbols of the Map but only on reels 2, 3, and 4. At that point, you can participate in a real treasure hunt: eight chests will appear on the screen in front of you, which you must open to collect the prize.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Captain Jack Slot\nThe testing phase of this online machine is generally positive, and the experience is not disappointing at all. The game requires a minimum bet of 0.02 cents and can go up to 20 euros. The default bet is set at €0.2 with the possibility of using one coin per pay line. We have 20 pay lines and a maximum number of free spins equal to three. The percentage of return to the player in winnings reaches 96.35%. As an experienced gambler, one can look forward to the exciting gameplay and bonuses offered by Captain Jack.\n            ",

Below, we will discover the technical and graphic characteristics of this slot machine, as well as all the quirks that make it so much fun!\n\nGraphics and Gameplay Features\nThe Captain Jack slot has a simple yet beautiful graphics, so attentive it even presents 3D animations. It has 5 reels and 20 pay lines that alternate a large number of figures and special symbols. And what can be expected from a pirate context situation? We have a flag complete with a Skull, a Sword, an Anchor, a Chest, a Cannon, a Helm, and much more. Among the special symbols, we have the unmissable Wilds and Scatters. The first, the game's wildcard, is represented by the Treasure Chest, which can help players obtain lucky combinations with its alignment on the game board. It can take on the value of any other icon but not the Scatter. This is represented by the Flag with the Skull, which has a special task: it must activate free spins, or it can also offer multipliers compared to the standard bet. It's necessary, however, for it to position itself on the reels, anywhere, at least for three symbols. Unfortunately, we found a small sore note here: compared to many other slots, it has a limited number of spins. The bonus spin offers only three spins, which is highly below average, but it is also true that these spins can be reactivated up to 20 times. A bonus game is added that allows players to multiply the bets made to increase the final prize. In this case, it's necessary to position at least three symbols of the Map but only on reels 2, 3, and 4. At that point, you can participate in a real treasure hunt: eight chests will appear on the screen in front of you, which you must open to collect the prize.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Captain Jack Slot\nThe testing phase of this online machine is generally positive, and the experience is not disappointing at all. The game requires a minimum bet of 0.02 cents and can go up to 20 euros. The default bet is set at €0.2 with the possibility of using one coin per pay line. We have 20 pay lines and a maximum number of free spins equal to three. The percentage of return to the player in winnings reaches 96.35%. As an experienced gambler, one can look forward to the exciting gameplay and bonuses offered by Captain Jack.\n            ",
