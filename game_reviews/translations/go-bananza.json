Go Bananza is a 3x3 slot game with 10 fixed paylines, multipliers and unlimited Free Spins. \n\nAn easy game \nThe online video slot market is constantly expanding, with new games being launched almost every week. The problem is that too many of these games are too similar to each other. For this reason, many game providers are now focusing on creating slots that stand out from the crowd with their monstrous graphics, complicated gameplay and confusing bonus features and rules that are difficult to understand.\n\nWhich is why we highly recommend Go Bananza, a game that delivers pure fun with its simple gameplay and well-crafted graphics. The main theme of the game is a charming monkey with a stylish hairdo, gold necklaces and a passion for bananas. The reels are set on a tree house while the symbols are beautifully drawn and light up when you win. Click on them while they spin to reveal their worth!\n\nThe music is engaging and won't interrupt the gameplay. \n\nFeatures of Go Bananza \nThe grid is small, with 3 reels and 3 rows, and only 10 fixed paylines. Before you begin, place your bet, which starts from just €0.10 and can go up to €250. \n\nYou can speed up the game in three ways: clicking on the Bet Max button sets the highest bet in one go, the Quick Spin button accelerates the rotation of the reels, while the Autoplay button allows you to activate automatic spins. \n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.5%.\n\nHow to win in Go Bananza \nOne unique aspect of this game is the low number of base symbols, just 5. The BAR symbol, replicated once, twice and three times, pays the least, while the two monkeys, one with a hat and one with sunglasses, have higher values.\n\nThe banana symbol rewards you anywhere on the reels, even with just two symbols. In addition, after each win, a multiplier is added, which is visible in the table next to the grid. \n\nThe Wild symbol is your Joker and replaces all symbols except for the banana and Scatter symbols. It also pays more than any other symbol. \n\nThe golden monkey is the Scatter symbol and you need three of them to activate 10 Free Spins. During the Free Spins feature, the function can be re-triggered with the arrival of another 3 Scatters. \n\nAfter each win, you have the opportunity to use the Gamble function and bet your winnings by guessing the color of the card drawn from the deck. If successful, you can double your winnings, but if you fail, you lose everything! \n\nFAQs \nHow many Free Spins can I win? \n\nYou can win 10 Free Spins with 3 Scatters in Go Bananza, but the feature can be re-triggered indefinitely. \n\nWhere can I find this game? \n\nGo Bananza will soon be available on all legal Italian online casinos certified by the Ministry. \n\nCan I play Go Bananza on my mobile phone? \n\nYes, Go Bananza is designed to work on all devices, desktop and mobile alike.\n            ",

Go Bananza is a 3x3 slot game with 10 fixed paylines, multipliers and unlimited Free Spins. \n\nAn easy game \nThe online video slot market is constantly expanding, with new games being launched almost every week. The problem is that too many of these games are too similar to each other. For this reason, many game providers are now focusing on creating slots that stand out from the crowd with their monstrous graphics, complicated gameplay and confusing bonus features and rules that are difficult to understand.\n\nWhich is why we highly recommend Go Bananza, a game that delivers pure fun with its simple gameplay and well-crafted graphics. The main theme of the game is a charming monkey with a stylish hairdo, gold necklaces and a passion for bananas. The reels are set on a tree house while the symbols are beautifully drawn and light up when you win. Click on them while they spin to reveal their worth!\n\nThe music is engaging and won't interrupt the gameplay. \n\nFeatures of Go Bananza \nThe grid is small, with 3 reels and 3 rows, and only 10 fixed paylines. Before you begin, place your bet, which starts from just €0.10 and can go up to €250. \n\nYou can speed up the game in three ways: clicking on the Bet Max button sets the highest bet in one go, the Quick Spin button accelerates the rotation of the reels, while the Autoplay button allows you to activate automatic spins. \n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.5%.\n\nHow to win in Go Bananza \nOne unique aspect of this game is the low number of base symbols, just 5. The BAR symbol, replicated once, twice and three times, pays the least, while the two monkeys, one with a hat and one with sunglasses, have higher values.\n\nThe banana symbol rewards you anywhere on the reels, even with just two symbols. In addition, after each win, a multiplier is added, which is visible in the table next to the grid. \n\nThe Wild symbol is your Joker and replaces all symbols except for the banana and Scatter symbols. It also pays more than any other symbol. \n\nThe golden monkey is the Scatter symbol and you need three of them to activate 10 Free Spins. During the Free Spins feature, the function can be re-triggered with the arrival of another 3 Scatters. \n\nAfter each win, you have the opportunity to use the Gamble function and bet your winnings by guessing the color of the card drawn from the deck. If successful, you can double your winnings, but if you fail, you lose everything! \n\nFAQs \nHow many Free Spins can I win? \n\nYou can win 10 Free Spins with 3 Scatters in Go Bananza, but the feature can be re-triggered indefinitely. \n\nWhere can I find this game? \n\nGo Bananza will soon be available on all legal Italian online casinos certified by the Ministry. \n\nCan I play Go Bananza on my mobile phone? \n\nYes, Go Bananza is designed to work on all devices, desktop and mobile alike.\n            ",

Go Bananza is a 3x3 slot game with 10 fixed paylines, multipliers and unlimited Free Spins. \n\nAn easy game \nThe online video slot market is constantly expanding, with new games being launched almost every week. The problem is that too many of these games are too similar to each other. For this reason, many game providers are now focusing on creating slots that stand out from the crowd with their monstrous graphics, complicated gameplay and confusing bonus features and rules that are difficult to understand.\n\nWhich is why we highly recommend Go Bananza, a game that delivers pure fun with its simple gameplay and well-crafted graphics. The main theme of the game is a charming monkey with a stylish hairdo, gold necklaces and a passion for bananas. The reels are set on a tree house while the symbols are beautifully drawn and light up when you win. Click on them while they spin to reveal their worth!\n\nThe music is engaging and won't interrupt the gameplay. \n\nFeatures of Go Bananza \nThe grid is small, with 3 reels and 3 rows, and only 10 fixed paylines. Before you begin, place your bet, which starts from just €0.10 and can go up to €250. \n\nYou can speed up the game in three ways: clicking on the Bet Max button sets the highest bet in one go, the Quick Spin button accelerates the rotation of the reels, while the Autoplay button allows you to activate automatic spins. \n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.5%.\n\nHow to win in Go Bananza \nOne unique aspect of this game is the low number of base symbols, just 5. The BAR symbol, replicated once, twice and three times, pays the least, while the two monkeys, one with a hat and one with sunglasses, have higher values.\n\nThe banana symbol rewards you anywhere on the reels, even with just two symbols. In addition, after each win, a multiplier is added, which is visible in the table next to the grid. \n\nThe Wild symbol is your Joker and replaces all symbols except for the banana and Scatter symbols. It also pays more than any other symbol. \n\nThe golden monkey is the Scatter symbol and you need three of them to activate 10 Free Spins. During the Free Spins feature, the function can be re-triggered with the arrival of another 3 Scatters. \n\nAfter each win, you have the opportunity to use the Gamble function and bet your winnings by guessing the color of the card drawn from the deck. If successful, you can double your winnings, but if you fail, you lose everything! \n\nFAQs \nHow many Free Spins can I win? \n\nYou can win 10 Free Spins with 3 Scatters in Go Bananza, but the feature can be re-triggered indefinitely. \n\nWhere can I find this game? \n\nGo Bananza will soon be available on all legal Italian online casinos certified by the Ministry. \n\nCan I play Go Bananza on my mobile phone? \n\nYes, Go Bananza is designed to work on all devices, desktop and mobile alike.\n        ",
