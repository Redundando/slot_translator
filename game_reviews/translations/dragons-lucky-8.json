Stake your meditation spot and catch a golden dragon on the Dragons Lucky 8 slot, which comes with free spins bonus and multipliers up to 8x.\n\nThe Chinese Taoist theme, featuring dragons, tigers, and a solitary prairie surrounded by rocky peaks, is beautifully portrayed in the Dragons Lucky 8 slot by Wazdan. The experts at this company have designed a wonderful slot game that can satisfy the appetite of any player and there is not a single good reason to miss out.\n\nThe Dragons Lucky 8 slot is played on a set of reels that deviates from the standard 3x5. This time we have three rows and six reels spinning on 20 always-active paylines. Along the way, reel rotations can yield multipliers ranging from x1 to x8, a gambling feature, and a wild symbol. There are also three scatters that pay on the winning bet and trigger a bonus. Wins are paid from left to right when three or more matching symbols land on a payline, and there could be more than one winning outcome per spin.\n\nFind out more about the game and maybe you will be interested in trying it out at one of the UK's best online casinos, which has a welcome offer on this page. \n\nYou can view all the payout symbols and additional game information by accessing the paytable, which can be found by clicking the \"i\" button on the left side of the ticker at the bottom. The most valuable symbols in the game are the two creatures that have been widely celebrated since ancient China - the dragon is the wild and pays 2500x on the maximum bet of £100. The scatter pays 1000x on the same, maximum, bet. In both cases, these symbols land in six positions on the reels. The rest of the symbols in terms of value are the pineapple, paying 1250x, and the orange, paying 800x. Grapes, bread, peaches, and apples pay lesser amounts but can still sustain you in the game.\n\nIn addition to the random win multipliers that land on the reels in values of x1, x3, x5, and x8, the game has another feature that can help players achieve potentially bigger wins. The scatter is the tiger. Its landing in three, four, five, or six positions, anywhere on the reels, will bring free spins respectively to 15, 20, 25, and 30 spins.\n\nWazdan is an up-and-coming studio, but they already have a few enjoyable slots, each with noteworthy design features. The Dragons Lucky 8 slot is one of these and we can see why. The symbols are sharp, the background and reel set seem to create a place where one can settle in, and there is smooth action on the reels.\n\nWazdan has surprised our slot experts as the musical themes are not of great value but are part of the gaming experience. This time, they brought a flute and an instrumental melody for the lute that is quite zen, which fits the theme perfectly.\n\nDragons are extremely prevalent creatures in Eastern culture, especially in Chinese culture. It is not uncommon to see them in ancient inscriptions but also in films and artwork. For this reason, these mythical animals have undoubtedly caught your attention.

This time they brought a flute and a rather Zen lute instrumental melody that fits perfectly with the theme.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDragons are extremely present creatures in oriental culture, especially in Chinese culture. It is not uncommon to see them in ancient inscriptions, but also in movies and artworks. For this reason, these mythological animals will certainly have caught your attention. If so, we can suggest other similar slots.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay features of Dragons Lucky 8\nSymbols and their payouts\nBonus rounds and multipliers\nGambling game feature\nOverall impression and recommended similar games\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Discover golden dragons, tigers of gold, and multipliers up to 8x on the Dragons Lucky 8 slot from Wazdan. With six reels, 20 paylines, and a free spins bonus, bets range from 0.20 to 100, with stunning visuals for those who appreciate an exciting adventure on the reels.\n\nClaim your meditation spot and capture a golden dragon on the Dragons Lucky 8 slot, which comes with a free spins bonus and multipliers up to 8x.\n\nAn Oriental-themed slot with Chinese Taoist themes, dragons, tigers, and a solitary meadow surrounded by rocky peaks can be found on the Wazdan Dragons Lucky 8 slot. The slot experts at this company have created a marvelous slot game that can satisfy the appetites of any player. And there is not one good reason not to play.\n\nDragons Lucky 8 slot game plays on a set of reels that deviates from the standard 3x5. This time, we have three rows and six reels that spin on 20 always-active paylines. Along the way, reel rotation can bring multipliers ranging from x1 to x8, a gambling game feature, and a wild symbol.\n\nThere are also three scatters that pay on the winning bet and trigger a bonus. Wins are paid from left to right when three or more matching symbols fall on a payline, and there may be more than one winning outcome per spin.\n\nDiscover more details about the game and perhaps you would be interested in trying it out at one of the best online casinos in the UK that offers a welcome bonus on this page.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nYou can view all the payout symbols and additional game information by accessing the paytable. This is done by the ‘i’ button on the left side of the bottom ticker.\n\nThe most valuable symbols in the game are the two creatures that have been widely celebrated since ancient China. The dragon is the wild and pays 2500x on the maximum bet of £100.00.\n\nThe scatter pays 1000x on the same, maximum, bet. In both cases, these symbols land in six positions on the reels.\n\nThe rest of the symbols in terms of value are the pineapple, paying 1250x, and the orange, paying 800x. The grape, bread, peaches, and apples pay lower amounts that can sustain you in the game.\n\nIn addition to the random win multipliers that arrive on the reels in values of x1, x3, x5, and x8, the game has another feature that can help players achieve potentially greater wins. The scatter is the tiger. Its landing in three, four, five, or six positions anywhere on the reels will respectively bring free spins to 15, 20, 25, and 30 spins.\n\nWazdan is a rising studio, but they already have a few slots that are entertaining enough, each with notable design features. The Dragons Lucky 8 slot is one of them, and we can see why. The symbols are sharp, the background and reel set seem to create a place where you can settle, and there is smooth action on the reels.\n\nWazdan has surprised our slot experts since the musical themes are not of great value since they are part of the gaming experience. This time they brought a flute and a rather Zen lute instrumental melody that fits perfectly with the theme.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDragons are extremely present creatures in oriental culture, especially in Chinese culture. It is not uncommon to see them in ancient inscriptions, but also in movies and artworks. For this reason, these mythological animals will certainly have caught your attention. If so, we can suggest other similar slots. An example is Triple Dragons, the dragon-themed slot machine with an incredible RTP percentage of 96.51%, perfect for those who want to make a lot of money.\n            ",

The grape, bread, peaches, and apples pay lower amounts that can sustain you in the game.\n\nIn addition to the random win multipliers that arrive on the reels in values of x1, x3, x5, and x8, the game has another feature that can help players achieve potentially greater wins. The scatter is the tiger. Its landing in three, four, five, or six positions anywhere on the reels will respectively bring free spins to 15, 20, 25, and 30 spins.\n\nWazdan is a rising studio, but they already have a few slots that are entertaining enough, each with notable design features. The Dragons Lucky 8 slot is one of them, and we can see why. The symbols are sharp, the background and reel set seem to create a place where you can settle, and there is smooth action on the reels.\n\nWazdan has surprised our slot experts since the musical themes are not of great value since they are part of the gaming experience. This time they brought a flute and a rather Zen lute instrumental melody that fits perfectly with the theme.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDragons are extremely present creatures in oriental culture, especially in Chinese culture. It is not uncommon to see them in ancient inscriptions, but also in movies and artworks. For this reason, these mythological animals will certainly have caught your attention. If so, we can suggest other similar slots. An example is Triple Dragons, the dragon-themed slot machine with an incredible RTP percentage of 96.51%, perfect for those who want to make a lot of money.\n            ",
