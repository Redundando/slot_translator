Il gioco ha come protagonisti vari guerrieri animali, che sono disegnati con un’estetica così impressionante, che si potrebbe pensare che questo sia un gioco di marca basato su una serie televisiva.\nDopo un po’ di ambientazione, i giocatori si trovano in una stanza a pilastri del castello, davanti a un pannello di gioco a 6 rulli alimentato da Megaways, semi-coperto di tessere di blocco. Non è così stimolante come una stanza piena di tesori custoditi da un drago, ma comunque piena di fantasia, se questo è il tuo genere.\nLe statistiche sono interessanti. Su tutta la linea, ogni categoria offre un numero sano, ma non sempre riflette il modo in cui le sessioni di gioco si sono svolte. Iniziare le cose in modo positivo è l’RTP con un valore predefinito del 96,49%, che sale al 96,82% o al 96,97% quando si acquistano rispettivamente i Free Spins Werewolf o Vampire.

Quattro rocce di basso valore iniziano i simboli di pagamento, poi arrivano monete, corone, arcieri, maghi, guerrieri e vampiri come valori più alti. Se una combinazione vincente di sei simboli di premi atterra, i giocatori raccolgono una vincita che vale da 2 a 10 volte la loro puntata.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nOgni eroe ha il proprio modificatore, attivato quando l’eroe è attivo e il suo simbolo corrispondente atterra sui rulli 2-5 nel gioco base o nei Vampire Free Spins:\nIl mago ha una funzione Explosion, e quando il simbolo Explosion compare esplodendo e rimuovendo se stesso, i simboli di pagamento non vincenti e le tessere bloccanti in una o due aree 2×2, o un’area 3×3. Dopo l’esplosione, 1 tipo di simbolo pagante casuale riempie tutti gli spazi vuoti creati dalla bomba.\nIl Guerriero porta con sé una caratteristica Expanding Wild. Quando il simbolo della spada atterra, il rullo su cui si trova viene trasformato in un Wild Reel, rimuovendo i simboli sopra o sotto di esso. Questo Wild Reel ottiene un moltiplicatore da x2 a x6, applicato a qualsiasi vincita di cui fa parte. Un altro wild di dimensioni 1×1 viene anche aggiunto a un altro rullo in una posizione casuale.\nL’Arciere porta una funzione Respin. Quando trovi il simbolo della freccia, esso e 4 o 9 altri simboli casuali non vincenti o bloccanti vengono rimossi. Il numero di tessere rimosse crea un moltiplicatore dello stesso valore. Nuovi simboli scendono a cascata per riempire gli spazi vuoti, e qualsiasi vincita è soggetta al moltiplicatore.\nMentre si cerca di sbloccare gli eroi, i simboli del forziere possono atterrare sul rullo 6. Quando lo fanno, aggiungono +1 EXP a uno degli eroi bloccati o innescano Werewolf Free Spins. Ci vogliono 3 EXP per sbloccare un eroe.\nSe i Werewolf Free Spins si attivano, i giocatori ottengono 10 giri gratuiti che non possono essere riattivati. Durante questa funzione, i simboli Werewolf Wild possono apparire sui rulli 2-5, trasformando in wild anche i simboli Warrior, Wizard o Archer adiacenti.\nQuando tutti e 3 gli eroi sono attivati, i simboli del petto smettono di atterrare sul rullo 6, e un nuovo simbolo chiave entra in gioco, apparendo in qualsiasi posizione. Quando 3 chiavi sono in vista, su piastrelle non bloccanti, vengono assegnati 10 Vampire Free Spins. Durante questa funzione, se la funzione Explosion, Expanding Wild, o Respin rimuove 12 o più simboli del Vampiro, il Vampiro viene ucciso, e vengono assegnati Super Free Spins. Ogni volta che un simbolo del Vampiro viene rimosso, o per ogni simbolo Vampiro vincente, viene aggiunto +1 Vampire Spins. Quando i Vampire Free Spins si concludono, i giocatori tornano al gioco base e scelgono un eroe da sbloccare di nuovo, ricominciando il processo da capo.\nI Super Free Spins, quando vengono assegnati, permettono di ottenere 2 giri gratuiti su un tavolo di gioco 6×6 completamente aperto dove ogni vincita viene moltiplicata per 100.

Dopo l’esplosione, 1 tipo di simbolo pagante casuale riempie tutti gli spazi vuoti creati dalla bomba.\nIl Guerriero porta con sé una caratteristica Expanding Wild. Quando il simbolo della spada atterra, il rullo su cui si trova viene trasformato in un Wild Reel, rimuovendo i simboli sopra o sotto di esso. Questo Wild Reel ottiene un moltiplicatore da x2 a x6, applicato a qualsiasi vincita di cui fa parte. Un altro wild di dimensioni 1×1 viene anche aggiunto a un altro rullo in una posizione casuale.\nL’Arciere porta una funzione Respin. Quando trovi il simbolo della freccia, esso e 4 o 9 altri simboli casuali non vincenti o bloccanti vengono rimossi. Il numero di tessere rimosse crea un moltiplicatore dello stesso valore. Nuovi simboli scendono a cascata per riempire gli spazi vuoti, e qualsiasi vincita è soggetta al moltiplicatore.\nMentre si cerca di sbloccare gli eroi, i simboli del forziere possono atterrare sul rullo 6. Quando lo fanno, aggiungono +1 EXP a uno degli eroi bloccati o innescano Werewolf Free Spins. Ci vogliono 3 EXP per sbloccare un eroe.\nSe i Werewolf Free Spins si attivano, i giocatori ottengono 10 giri gratuiti che non possono essere riattivati. Durante questa funzione, i simboli Werewolf Wild possono apparire sui rulli 2-5, trasformando in wild anche i simboli Warrior, Wizard o Archer adiacenti.\nQuando tutti e 3 gli eroi sono attivati, i simboli del petto smettono di atterrare sul rullo 6, e un nuovo simbolo chiave entra in gioco, apparendo in qualsiasi posizione. Quando 3 chiavi sono in vista, su piastrelle non bloccanti, vengono assegnati 10 Vampire Free Spins. Durante questa funzione, se la funzione Explosion, Expanding Wild, o Respin rimuove 12 o più simboli del Vampiro, il Vampiro viene ucciso, e vengono assegnati Super Free Spins. Ogni volta che un simbolo del Vampiro viene rimosso, o per ogni simbolo Vampiro vincente, viene aggiunto +1 Vampire Spins. Quando i Vampire Free Spins si concludono, i giocatori tornano al gioco base e scelgono un eroe da sbloccare di nuovo, ricominciando il processo da capo.\nI Super Free Spins, quando vengono assegnati, permettono di ottenere 2 giri gratuiti su un tavolo di gioco 6×6 completamente aperto dove ogni vincita viene moltiplicata per 100. Solo i simboli jolly o regolari appaiono durante i Super Free Spins.\n\n        ",

Many of the criticisms of the first installment were due to the long animations and the difficulty in activating bonus games. In response, Fantasma Games has gone back to the drawing board and released Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways, a game that utilizes the fundamental concepts found in the first, with new missions to complete.\n\nIf you enjoy slots where modifiers play an important role, then you should consider trying Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways. Although here we have the same betting prizes as in Heroes Hunt Megaways, improvements have been made to the features. In addition to the modifiers, there are three types of free spins and expanding wilds. To learn more about Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways Slot, continue reading our full review.\n\nA fantasy RPG-like graphic\n\nHeroes Hunt 2 Megaways closely resembles the original slot, based on a medieval setting with great attention to detail. The game features various animal warriors, designed with such an impressive aesthetic that one might think this is a branded game based on a TV series.\n\nAfter a bit of setting, players find themselves in a pillared room of the castle, in front of a game panel with 6 Megaways-fed rolls, semi-covered by blocking tiles. It's not as exciting as a room full of treasures guarded by a dragon, but it's full of imagination, if this is your genre.\n\nThe stats are interesting. Across the board, each category offers a healthy number, although it doesn't always reflect how the gaming sessions have gone. Starting things off positively is the RTP with a default value of 96.49%, which goes up to 96.82% or 96.97% when you respectively purchase the Free Spins Werewolf or Vampire. As before, the adventure is highly volatile, with a great potential on offer, although the maximum limit has been lowered a bit this time. Betting range is possible from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin, all available on any device.\n\nPress \"spin\", and up to six symbols land on each reel, producing between 64 and 46,656 ways to win. Players win when three or more matching symbols land from left to right in any row starting from the leftmost reel. Four low-value rocks start the pay symbols, then come coins, crowns, archers, wizards, warriors, and vampires as higher values. If a winning combination of six prize symbols lands, players collect a win worth 2 to 10 times their bet.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nEach hero has his own modifier, activated when the hero is active, and his corresponding symbol lands on reels 2-5 in the base game or in the Vampire Free Spins:\n\nThe wizard has an Explosion feature, and when the Explosion symbol appears exploding and removing itself, non-winning pay symbols and blocking tiles in one or two 2×2 areas, or a 3×3 area, are removed. After the explosion, 1 random paying symbol type fills all empty spaces created by the bomb.\n\nThe Warrior brings with him an Expanding Wild feature. When the sword symbol lands, the reel on which it is located is transformed into a Wild Reel, removing the symbols above or below it. This Wild Reel gets a multiplier from x2 to x6, applied to any win it is part of. Another 1×1 sized wild is also added to another reel in a random position.\n\nThe Archer brings a Respin feature. When you find the arrow symbol, it and 4 or 9 other random non-winning or blocking symbols are removed. The number of tiles removed creates a multiplier of the same value. New symbols cascade down to fill the empty spaces, and any win is subject to the multiplier.\n\nWhile trying to unlock the heroes, the chest symbols can land on reel 6. When they do, they add +1 EXP to one of the blocked heroes or trigger Werewolf Free Spins. It takes 3 EXP to unlock a hero.\n\nIf the Werewolf Free Spins are triggered, players get 10 free spins that cannot be reactivated. During this feature, Werewolf Wild symbols can appear on reels 2-5, also transforming adjacent Warrior, Wizard, or Archer symbols into wilds.\n\nWhen all 3 heroes are activated, chest symbols stop landing on reel 6, and a new key symbol comes into play, appearing in any position. When 3 keys are in view, on non-blocking tiles, 10 Vampire Free Spins are awarded. During this feature, if the Explosion, Expanding Wild, or Respin feature removes 12 or more Vampire symbols, the Vampire is killed, and Super Free Spins are awarded. Every time a Vampire symbol is removed, or for every winning Vampire symbol, +1 Vampire Spins is added. When the Vampire Free Spins end, players return to the base game and choose a hero to unlock again, starting the process anew.\n\nThe Super Free Spins, when awarded, allow for 2 free spins on a 6×6 fully open game board where every win is multiplied by 100. Only regular or joker symbols appear during the Super Free Spins."

Many of the criticisms of the first installment were due to the long animations and the difficulty in activating bonus games. In response, Fantasma Games has gone back to the drawing board and released Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways, a game that utilizes the fundamental concepts found in the first, with new missions to complete.\n\nIf you enjoy slots where modifiers play an important role, then you should consider trying Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways. Although here we have the same betting prizes as in Heroes Hunt Megaways, improvements have been made to the features. In addition to the modifiers, there are three types of free spins and expanding wilds. To learn more about Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways Slot, continue reading our full review.\n\nA fantasy RPG-like graphic\n\nHeroes Hunt 2 Megaways closely resembles the original slot, based on a medieval setting with great attention to detail. The game features various animal warriors, designed with such an impressive aesthetic that one might think this is a branded game based on a TV series.\n\nAfter a bit of setting, players find themselves in a pillared room of the castle, in front of a game panel with 6 Megaways-fed rolls, semi-covered by blocking tiles. It's not as exciting as a room full of treasures guarded by a dragon, but it's full of imagination, if this is your genre.\n\nThe stats are interesting. Across the board, each category offers a healthy number, although it doesn't always reflect how the gaming sessions have gone. Starting things off positively is the RTP with a default value of 96.49%, which goes up to 96.82% or 96.97% when you respectively purchase the Free Spins Werewolf or Vampire. As before, the adventure is highly volatile, with a great potential on offer, although the maximum limit has been lowered a bit this time. Betting range is possible from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin, all available on any device.\n\nPress \"spin\", and up to six symbols land on each reel, producing between 64 and 46,656 ways to win. Players win when three or more matching symbols land from left to right in any row starting from the leftmost reel. Four low-value rocks start the pay symbols, then come coins, crowns, archers, wizards, warriors, and vampires as higher values. If a winning combination of six prize symbols lands, players collect a win worth 2 to 10 times their bet.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nEach hero has his own modifier, activated when the hero is active, and his corresponding symbol lands on reels 2-5 in the base game or in the Vampire Free Spins:\n\nThe wizard has an Explosion feature, and when the Explosion symbol appears exploding and removing itself, non-winning pay symbols and blocking tiles in one or two 2×2 areas, or a 3×3 area, are removed. After the explosion, 1 random paying symbol type fills all empty spaces created by the bomb.\n\nThe Warrior brings with him an Expanding Wild feature. When the sword symbol lands, the reel on which it is located is transformed into a Wild Reel, removing the symbols above or below it. This Wild Reel gets a multiplier from x2 to x6, applied to any win it is part of. Another 1×1 sized wild is also added to another reel in a random position.\n\nThe Archer brings a Respin feature. When you find the arrow symbol, it and 4 or 9 other random non-winning or blocking symbols are removed. The number of tiles removed creates a multiplier of the same value. New symbols cascade down to fill the empty spaces, and any win is subject to the multiplier.\n\nWhile trying to unlock the heroes, the chest symbols can land on reel 6. When they do, they add +1 EXP to one of the blocked heroes or trigger Werewolf Free Spins. It takes 3 EXP to unlock a hero.\n\nIf the Werewolf Free Spins are triggered, players get 10 free spins that cannot be reactivated. During this feature, Werewolf Wild symbols can appear on reels 2-5, also transforming adjacent Warrior, Wizard, or Archer symbols into wilds.\n\nWhen all 3 heroes are activated, chest symbols stop landing on reel 6, and a new key symbol comes into play, appearing in any position. When 3 keys are in view, on non-blocking tiles, 10 Vampire Free Spins are awarded. During this feature, if the Explosion, Expanding Wild, or Respin feature removes 12 or more Vampire symbols, the Vampire is killed, and Super Free Spins are awarded. Every time a Vampire symbol is removed, or for every winning Vampire symbol, +1 Vampire Spins is added. When the Vampire Free Spins end, players return to the base game and choose a hero to unlock again, starting the process anew.\n\nThe Super Free Spins, when awarded, allow for 2 free spins on a 6×6 fully open game board where every win is multiplied by 100. Only regular or joker symbols appear during the Super Free Spins.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics\n\nHeroes Hunt 2 Megaways features a medieval RPG-like setting with six Megaways-fed rolls. Up to six symbols can land on each reel, producing between 64 and 46,656 ways to win. Players win when three or more matching symbols land from left to right in any row starting from the leftmost reel. The adventure is highly volatile, with a great potential on offer, and interesting modifiers. Pressing 'spin', the player can bet from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin, on any device.\n\nFree Spin Features\n\nHeroes Hunt 2 Megaways offers three types of free spins: the Werewolf Free Spins, the Vampire Free Spins, and the Super Free Spins. The Werewolf Free Spins awards the player 10 free spins that cannot be reactivated, and during this feature, Werewolf Wild symbols can appear on reels 2-5, also transforming adjacent Warrior, Wizard, or Archer symbols into wilds. The Vampire Free Spins consist of 10 free spins that are triggered when three key symbols appear on non-blocking tiles. During this feature, if the Explosion, Expanding Wild, or Respin feature removes 12 or more Vampire symbols, the Vampire is killed, and Super Free Spins are awarded. Every time a Vampire symbol is removed, or for every winning Vampire symbol, +1 Vampire Spins are added. Finally, the Super Free Spins is triggered when it is awarded and it allows for 2 free spins on a 6×6 fully open game board where every win is multiplied by 100. Only regular or joker symbols appear during the Super Free Spins.\n\nVisual Design\n\nHeroes Hunt 2 Megaways closely resembles the original slot, based on a medieval setting with great attention to detail. The game features various animal warriors, designed with such an impressive aesthetic that one might think this is a branded game based on a TV series. Players will find themselves in a pillared room of the castle, in front of a game panel with 6 Megaways-fed rolls, semi-covered by blocking tiles. The graphic design is fantasy RPG-like and full of imagination.\n\nModifiers\n\nIn Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways, each hero has his own modifier, activated when the hero is active, and his corresponding symbol lands on reels 2-5 in the base game or in the Vampire Free Spins. The wizard has an Explosion feature, the Warrior brings with him an Expanding Wild feature, and the Archer brings a Respin feature. All of these modifiers are interesting and can lead to great payouts.\n\nStats\n\nThe RTP for Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways has a default value of 96.49%, which can go up to 96.82% or 96.97% when purchasing the Free Spins Werewolf or Vampire, respectively. The game is highly volatile with a great potential on offer, although the maximum limit has been lowered a bit this time. Across the board, each category offers a healthy number, although it doesn't always reflect how the gaming sessions have gone.\n\nBetting Options\n\nPlayers can bet from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin. Betting options are available on any device, so the players can enjoy the game from their mobile phone, tablet, or desktop computer.\n\nObjective of the Game\n\nThe objective of Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways is to collect wins by landing three or more matching symbols from left to right in any row starting from the leftmost reel. The game also offers the possibility to unlock three heroes and activate their corresponding modifiers. The ultimate objective of the game is to trigger the Super Free Spins and get huge payouts.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Modifiers\n\nHeroes Hunt 2 Megaways features three modifiers, one for each of the heroes (Wizard, Warrior, and Archer) when they land on specific reels. The modifiers are the Explosion feature, the Expanding Wild feature, and the Respin feature. Players have to unlock each hero by obtaining enough EXP and landing the corresponding chest symbols. Each modifier helps remove non-winning pay symbols or blocking tiles and can produce additional wilds and multipliers. These modifiers make gameplay more interesting and exciting, adding a new dimension to the traditional Megaways mechanics.\n\nFree Spins\n\nHeroes Hunt 2 Megaways offers three types of free spins, each with its own unique twist: Werewolf Free Spins, Vampire Free Spins, and Super Free Spins. To access the Werewolf Free Spins, players must collect 3 chest symbols. Werewolf Wild symbols are active throughout this feature and can transform adjacent Warrior, Wizard, or Archer symbols into wilds, increasing the chances of a win. Once the 3 heroes are unlocked, the Vampire Free Spins are activated. The Vampire Free Spins offer players the chance to kill vampires for massive wins and can lead to Super Free Spins if enough vampires are slayed. During these Super Free Spins, all wins are multiplied by 100. These three types of free spins offer players multiple opportunities to win big and add diversity to the gameplay.\n\nVisuals\n\nHeroes Hunt 2 Megaways features a fantasy RPG-like graphic set in a medieval castle environment. The animal warriors and the castle are designed with impressive attention to detail, making the game aesthetically pleasing and immersive. The game's animations are engaging, although at times lengthy, which may not suit players who prefer a faster-paced gaming experience.\n\nStats\n\nHeroes Hunt 2 Megaways offers players a healthy number in each category. The game's RTP has a default value of 96.49%, which goes up to 96.82% or 96.97% if players purchase the Free Spins Werewolf or Vampire. The betting range is from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin.

Players can take advantage of increasing their RTP by purchasing the Free Spins Werewolf or Vampire.

This wide range makes the game accessible to both high rollers and casual players who want to enjoy the game without risking too much.\n\nSymbols and Objectives\n\nThe symbols in Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways are based on a medieval setting.

The objective is to match three or more symbols of the same type, which pay from left to right in any row starting from the leftmost reel. Matching a combination of six prize symbols results in a win worth between 2 and 10 times the bet.\n\nSuper Free Spins\n\nThe Super Free Spins in Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways allow players to enjoy two free spins on a fully open 6x6 game board where every win is multiplied by 100. During the Super Free Spins, only regular or joker symbols appear, removing the low-value symbols on the reels.

In response, Fantasma Games has gone back to the drawing board and released Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways, a game that utilizes the fundamental concepts found in the first, with new missions to complete.\n\nIf you enjoy slots where modifiers play an important role, then you should consider trying Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways. Although here we have the same betting prizes as in Heroes Hunt Megaways, improvements have been made to the features. In addition to the modifiers, there are three types of free spins and expanding wilds. To learn more about Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways Slot, continue reading our full review.\n\nA fantasy RPG-like graphic\n\nHeroes Hunt 2 Megaways closely resembles the original slot, based on a medieval setting with great attention to detail. The game features various animal warriors, designed with such an impressive aesthetic that one might think this is a branded game based on a TV series.\n\nAfter a bit of setting, players find themselves in a pillared room of the castle, in front of a game panel with 6 Megaways-fed rolls, semi-covered by blocking tiles. It's not as exciting as a room full of treasures guarded by a dragon, but it's full of imagination, if this is your genre.\n\nThe stats are interesting. Across the board, each category offers a healthy number, although it doesn't always reflect how the gaming sessions have gone. Starting things off positively is the RTP with a default value of 96.49%, which goes up to 96.82% or 96.97% when you respectively purchase the Free Spins Werewolf or Vampire. As before, the adventure is highly volatile, with a great potential on offer, although the maximum limit has been lowered a bit this time.

Four low-value rocks start the pay symbols, then come coins, crowns, archers, wizards, warriors, and vampires as higher values. If a winning combination of six prize symbols lands, players collect a win worth 2 to 10 times their bet.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nEach hero has his own modifier, activated when the hero is active, and his corresponding symbol lands on reels 2-5 in the base game or in the Vampire Free Spins:\n\nThe wizard has an Explosion feature, and when the Explosion symbol appears exploding and removing itself, non-winning pay symbols and blocking tiles in one or two 2×2 areas, or a 3×3 area, are removed. After the explosion, 1 random paying symbol type fills all empty spaces created by the bomb.\n\nThe Warrior brings with him an Expanding Wild feature. When the sword symbol lands, the reel on which it is located is transformed into a Wild Reel, removing the symbols above or below it. This Wild Reel gets a multiplier from x2 to x6, applied to any win it is part of. Another 1×1 sized wild is also added to another reel in a random position.\n\nThe Archer brings a Respin feature. When you find the arrow symbol, it and 4 or 9 other random non-winning or blocking symbols are removed. The number of tiles removed creates a multiplier of the same value. New symbols cascade down to fill the empty spaces, and any win is subject to the multiplier.\n\nWhile trying to unlock the heroes, the chest symbols can land on reel 6. When they do, they add +1 EXP to one of the blocked heroes or trigger Werewolf Free Spins. It takes 3 EXP to unlock a hero.\n\nIf the Werewolf Free Spins are triggered, players get 10 free spins that cannot be reactivated. During this feature, Werewolf Wild symbols can appear on reels 2-5, also transforming adjacent Warrior, Wizard, or Archer symbols into wilds.\n\nWhen all 3 heroes are activated, chest symbols stop landing on reel 6, and a new key symbol comes into play, appearing in any position. When 3 keys are in view, on non-blocking tiles, 10 Vampire Free Spins are awarded. During this feature, if the Explosion, Expanding Wild, or Respin feature removes 12 or more Vampire symbols, the Vampire is killed, and Super Free Spins are awarded. Every time a Vampire symbol is removed, or for every winning Vampire symbol, +1 Vampire Spins is added. When the Vampire Free Spins end, players return to the base game and choose a hero to unlock again, starting the process anew.\n\nThe Super Free Spins, when awarded, allow for 2 free spins on a 6×6 fully open game board where every win is multiplied by 100. Only regular or joker symbols appear during the Super Free Spins.\n            ",

Many of the criticisms of the first installment were due to the long animations and the difficulty in activating bonus games. In response, Fantasma Games has gone back to the drawing board and released Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways, a game that utilizes the fundamental concepts found in the first, with new missions to complete.\n\nIf you enjoy slots where modifiers play an important role, then you should consider trying Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways. Although here we have the same betting prizes as in Heroes Hunt Megaways, improvements have been made to the features. In addition to the modifiers, there are three types of free spins and expanding wilds. To learn more about Heroes Hunt 2 Megaways Slot, continue reading our full review.\n\nA fantasy RPG-like graphic\n\nHeroes Hunt 2 Megaways closely resembles the original slot, based on a medieval setting with great attention to detail. The game features various animal warriors, designed with such an impressive aesthetic that one might think this is a branded game based on a TV series.\n\nAfter a bit of setting, players find themselves in a pillared room of the castle, in front of a game panel with 6 Megaways-fed rolls, semi-covered by blocking tiles. It's not as exciting as a room full of treasures guarded by a dragon, but it's full of imagination, if this is your genre.\n\nThe stats are interesting. Across the board, each category offers a healthy number, although it doesn't always reflect how the gaming sessions have gone. Starting things off positively is the RTP with a default value of 96.49%, which goes up to 96.82% or 96.97% when you respectively purchase the Free Spins Werewolf or Vampire. As before, the adventure is highly volatile, with a great potential on offer, although the maximum limit has been lowered a bit this time. Betting range is possible from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin, all available on any device.\n\nPress \"spin\", and up to six symbols land on each reel, producing between 64 and 46,656 ways to win. Players win when three or more matching symbols land from left to right in any row starting from the leftmost reel. Four low-value rocks start the pay symbols, then come coins, crowns, archers, wizards, warriors, and vampires as higher values. If a winning combination of six prize symbols lands, players collect a win worth 2 to 10 times their bet.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nEach hero has his own modifier, activated when the hero is active, and his corresponding symbol lands on reels 2-5 in the base game or in the Vampire Free Spins:\n\nThe wizard has an Explosion feature, and when the Explosion symbol appears exploding and removing itself, non-winning pay symbols and blocking tiles in one or two 2×2 areas, or a 3×3 area, are removed. After the explosion, 1 random paying symbol type fills all empty spaces created by the bomb.\n\nThe Warrior brings with him an Expanding Wild feature. When the sword symbol lands, the reel on which it is located is transformed into a Wild Reel, removing the symbols above or below it. This Wild Reel gets a multiplier from x2 to x6, applied to any win it is part of. Another 1×1 sized wild is also added to another reel in a random position.\n\nThe Archer brings a Respin feature. When you find the arrow symbol, it and 4 or 9 other random non-winning or blocking symbols are removed. The number of tiles removed creates a multiplier of the same value. New symbols cascade down to fill the empty spaces, and any win is subject to the multiplier.\n\nWhile trying to unlock the heroes, the chest symbols can land on reel 6. When they do, they add +1 EXP to one of the blocked heroes or trigger Werewolf Free Spins. It takes 3 EXP to unlock a hero.\n\nIf the Werewolf Free Spins are triggered, players get 10 free spins that cannot be reactivated. During this feature, Werewolf Wild symbols can appear on reels 2-5, also transforming adjacent Warrior, Wizard, or Archer symbols into wilds.\n\nWhen all 3 heroes are activated, chest symbols stop landing on reel 6, and a new key symbol comes into play, appearing in any position. When 3 keys are in view, on non-blocking tiles, 10 Vampire Free Spins are awarded. During this feature, if the Explosion, Expanding Wild, or Respin feature removes 12 or more Vampire symbols, the Vampire is killed, and Super Free Spins are awarded. Every time a Vampire symbol is removed, or for every winning Vampire symbol, +1 Vampire Spins is added. When the Vampire Free Spins end, players return to the base game and choose a hero to unlock again, starting the process anew.\n\nThe Super Free Spins, when awarded, allow for 2 free spins on a 6×6 fully open game board where every win is multiplied by 100. Only regular or joker symbols appear during the Super Free Spins.\n        ",
