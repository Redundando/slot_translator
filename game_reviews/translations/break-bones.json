They're about the symbols, the graphics, and the sheer fun of it all. That's exactly what you'll get with <em>Break Bones</em>. This game features a mix of standard and extra symbols that will keep you on your toes.</p><p>The card suits (A, J) might not be the most exciting symbols, but they're still a necessary part of any good slot game. Plus, they'll come in handy when you need to build up your winnings. On the other hand, the higher value symbols will really make your heart race. Who doesn't love graffiti of skulls in different colors? The orange, blue with purple eyes, green, and blue skull with a green geometric shape are all unique and eye-catching. And let's not forget about the most expensive symbol in the standard paytable - that one's a real game-changer.</p><p>Of course, what would a good slot game be without a few extra symbols? <em>Break Bones</em> has three different ones to keep things interesting. First up is the Wild symbol, which can substitute for any other symbol on the reels (except for the Scatters, of course). Next, we have the Skeleton Hand Scatter symbol. Get three or more of these bad boys on the reels, and you'll trigger some free spins that will keep you playing for hours. And finally, we have the Bones Game Scatter symbol. Land three or more of these, and you'll trigger the bonus game where you get to break some bones (virtually, of course).</p><p>So, what are you waiting for? Give <em>Break Bones</em> a spin and see if you can land those Scatter symbols. Who knows - you might just break the bank (or some bones).</p>\"\n}"

The Break Bones slot game has an array of colorful icons, each with their own value. Starting with the lower value symbols, we have the AJ card suits, which are as common as pigeons in New York City.</p><p> Now, for the higher value symbols, we get to see some truly rockin' graffiti skulls. We've got orange, blue with purple eyes (we're not asking questions here), green, and finally, a blue skull with a green geometric design that puts our high school math teacher's whiteboard to shame.</p><p>But wait, there's more! The blue skull is the most valuable symbol, making it the Mick Jagger of the paytable. If you land this dude five times on a payline, you'll be screaming, 'I can't get no satisfaction!'</p><p>When it comes to the extra paytable features, the Wild symbol is represented by the letter 'W' (Because Wizard was taken, we guess?), replacing icons on paylines for more wins. Then there's the Skeleton Hand Scatter symbol, which activates the respins feature. This feature can really come in handy when you're on a roll like a sushi chef. </p><p>And last, but certainly not least, there's a Bones Game Scatter symbol that activates the Bonus Round. This spooky, eerie bonus round is your chance to break the bank like a skull in a death metal concert.</p>\"\n}"

The game features an Urban Graffiti theme with eye-catching graphics and an electronic music background. It has a medium volatility and an RTP of 96.22%, making it suitable for both experienced and novice players. You can set your bet from 0.1€ up to 100€ and choose from 10 to 1,000 automatic spins using the advanced settings.\n\nSymbols and Paytable\n\nThe slot game features standard and extra symbols. Lower value symbols are the card suits (A, J), while the higher value symbols are graffiti of various skulls in four colors: orange, blue with purple eyes, green, and a blue skull with a green geometric shape on it. The last skull is the most expensive symbol in the standard paytable. Three extra symbols include the Wild, the Skeleton Hand Scatter symbol, and the Bones Game Scatter symbol.\n\nSpecial Features - Wild and Global Multipliers\n\nThe Wild symbol, represented by the letter \"W\", can substitute any icon on paylines, except for the Scatter symbols. The Wild can also appear on reels as a Wild multiplier, increasing your payout by 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 10x, 25x, 50x, or 100x. The Global Multiplier feature will be triggered when a large number of Wilds appear on reels, multiplying your winnings.\n\nSpecial Features - Echo Spins Feature\n\nThe Echo Spins feature is activated when the Skeleton Hand Scatter symbol appears along with at least 1 winning payline. You will be awarded 1 to 5 Echo Spins, and the position of the symbols on the reels will be identical to those that activated the bonus round. This means that you will receive a win on every respin. \n\nSpecial Features - Bones Game\n\nThe Bones Game feature is the free spin bonus round. When 3 Bones Game Scatter symbols appear on reels, you will automatically receive 10 free spins. During the bonus round, you can also get the previous bonus features, such as Wild multipliers and Echo Spins, that can increase your payout significantly. \n\n        \n            ",

The theme is well represented with original graphics and an electronic music background. The game offers a minimum bet of 0.1€ and a maximum of 100€, making it accessible to beginners and experienced players alike. The RTP is 96.22%, and the game has medium volatility.\n\nSymbols and Paytable in Break Bones\n\nThe Break Bones slot has a standard paytable with lower and higher value symbols. The lower value symbols consist of the AJ card suits, while the higher value symbols are graffiti of various skulls in four colors: orange, blue with purple eyes, green, and a blue skull with a green geometric design. The most expensive symbol is the blue skull. The extra paytable features three symbols: the Wild, represented by the letter 'W,' which replaces icons on paylines, the Skeleton Hand Scatter symbol, which activates the respins feature, and the Bones Game Scatter symbol, which activates the Bonus Round.\n\nSpecial Features in the Free Break Bones Slot\n\nBreak Bones has several special features, including:\n\n- Wild Multipliers and Global Multipliers: The Wild symbol can appear on the reels as a Wild multiplier, which can increase your winnings by 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 10x, 25x, 50x, or 100x. When a high number of Wilds appears on the reels, the Global Multiplier feature is activated, multiplying your winnings.\n\n- Echo Spins Feature: When the Skeleton Hand Scatter symbol appears alongside at least one winning payline, you receive 1 to 5 EchoSpins. The bonus of this feature is that you receive a win on every respin, as the symbols and their positions on the reels are identical to those that activated the bonus round.\n\n- Bones Game (Free Spins): This feature activates when three Scatter symbols, i.e., the Bones Game Scatter symbol, appear on reels, and you automatically obtain ten free spins. In the Bonus Round, you can also get the previous bonus features, which can significantly increase your winnings.\n\n- Buy Bonus: If you do not want to await Scatters to appear on the reels and want to try your luck in the Bonus Round immediately, you can buy it for 80 times your bet.\n\nWild Multipliers and Global Multipliers\n\nThe Wild symbol can appear on the reels as a normal Wild and a Wild multiplier. The Wild multiplier can increase your winnings by 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 10x, 25x, 50x, or 100x. The Global Multiplier feature is activated when many Wilds appear on the reels, multiplying your winnings.\n\nEcho Spins Feature\n\nThe Echo Spins Feature is activated when the Skeleton Hand Scatter symbol appears with at least one winning payline. You obtain 1 to 5 EchoSpins. The unique aspect of this feature is that you obtain a win on every respin, since the symbols and their positions on the reels are identical to those that activated the bonus round.\n\n        \n            ",
