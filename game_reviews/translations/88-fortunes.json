Questo vuol dire che, sul lungo periodo, per ogni 100€ giocati dagli utenti all’interno della slot, essa ne rilascerà almeno 96 in forma di vincita.

However, the superstitions and folklore of the East, specifically China, continue to be popular themes due to their association with wealth and legend. WMS has chosen this theme for their slot game, 88 Fortunes, which we will review in detail, starting with the visual components and then moving onto the technical aspects of the game.\n\nVisually, as is customary with Chinese-themed slots, the predominant colors in 88 Fortunes are red and gold. The former is heavily used in the game's interface and grid, while the latter is used in various symbols and payouts. Players have the option to adjust the amount of gold on the screen, as we will see in the subsequent section of this review. The slot does not have a particular soundtrack but immediately immerses the player in an oriental motif upon spinning the reels, allowing players to get into the right mood for gambling.\n\n88 Fortunes makes use of a 5x3 mechanism that showcases fifteen symbols per spin. Its RTP or return-to-player is 96%, which is an average value in the online market. This means that over the long run, for every €100 played, the slot will release at least €96 in winnings. Considering that the legal minimum is 90%, and the maximum is usually less than 100% (otherwise, the slot game will not generate profits), 96% is a value that cannot be ignored.\n\nIn terms of gameplay mechanics, the slot has some interesting features. On the left side of the screen, players can choose how many credits they wish to use per spin, with a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 88, each unlock a respective number of gold symbols. This function turns four of the shown symbols on the grid into gold, at a steep cost that increases depending on the chosen credit amount, potentially elevating the payout to twenty times the original value. It is then up to the player to determine their gameplay strategy in response to this personalized feature, which the slot offers.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is not uncommon to come across Chinese-themed slots online, WMS' 88 Fortunes stands out thanks to its customizable gameplay mechanics and striking visual aesthetics. If you enjoy this type of slots, we also recommend 108 Heroes by Microgaming (also available on mobile devices) or 3888 Ways of the Dragon by iSoftBet – both of which feature the beloved number 8.",

One of the most common themes, due to its strong ties to wealth and legends, is superstition and Eastern folklore - specifically Chinese folklore. WMS has chosen this exact theme for their slot game, 88 Fortunes; and we're going to explore it in detail in this review, starting with the visual aspect and moving on to the more technical aspects of the game.\n\n88 Fortunes: The Visuals\n\nAs is customary with Chinese-themed slot games, red and gold reign supreme within WMS's 88 Fortunes. Red dominates the game's interface and the grid itself, while gold is used in the various symbols and wins. We are free to choose how much gold we want displayed on the screen (as we'll see in the next part of the review). The slot doesn't feature a specific music, but an Oriental melody starts playing immediately as we take our first spin, allowing the player to get into the right mindset to play.\n\nFundamentally speaking, 88 Fortunes pays the price for not having a chromatic division between the game's frame and grid, making the first visual impact particularly heavy. However, once we've adjusted our eyes, we can enjoy all the features this title has to offer.\n\n88 Fortunes: The Gameplay\n\nLet's move on to the technical aspect of the game: to begin with, WMS's 88 Fortunes is a slot that uses a 5x3 mechanism, showing 15 symbols for each bet. The RTP, or Return to Player, is 96%, which is about average for the online market. This means that, over time, for every €100 wagered by the players, the slot will release at least €96 in winnings. Considering that the legal minimum is 90% and the maximum is usually less than 100% (otherwise, the slot won't generate any profit), 96% is not a value to be underestimated.\n\nContinuing to talk about gameplay mechanics, the slot presents some interesting ideas: on the left, we can choose how many credits to use for each spin, ranging from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 88, unlocking 1 to 5 gold symbols respectively. Essentially, this function can turn four of the symbols displayed in the game grid into gold; the cost of playing increases exponentially (by up to 11 times, depending on the value of our bet), but the same can be said for the value of the wins, which (in some cases) can reach a value twenty times greater than the original amount. It's up to the player to decide their own strategy to make the most of this customization feature offered by the slot.\n\nSlots Similar to 88 Fortunes\n\nAs previously mentioned, it's not uncommon to find the Eastern world (and specifically the Chinese world) in online slots, so we have various choices if we want to try similar games. Starting from Microgaming's 108 Heroes (also available in mobile version) to iSoftBet's 3888 Ways of the Dragon (as you can see, the number 8 is particularly appreciated in this type of slot). For experienced gamblers who are familiar with the world of slot games, 88 Fortunes is a classic that shouldn't be missed.\n            ",

The RTP, or Return to Player, is 96%, which is about average for the online market. This means that, over time, for every €100 wagered by the players, the slot will release at least €96 in winnings. Considering that the legal minimum is 90% and the maximum is usually less than 100% (otherwise, the slot won't generate any profit), 96% is not a value to be underestimated.\n\nContinuing to talk about gameplay mechanics, the slot presents some interesting ideas: on the left, we can choose how many credits to use for each spin, ranging from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 88, unlocking 1 to 5 gold symbols respectively. Essentially, this function can turn four of the symbols displayed in the game grid into gold; the cost of playing increases exponentially (by up to 11 times, depending on the value of our bet), but the same can be said for the value of the wins, which (in some cases) can reach a value twenty times greater than the original amount. It's up to the player to decide their own strategy to make the most of this customization feature offered by the slot.\n\nSlots Similar to 88 Fortunes\n\nAs previously mentioned, it's not uncommon to find the Eastern world (and specifically the Chinese world) in online slots, so we have various choices if we want to try similar games. Starting from Microgaming's 108 Heroes (also available in mobile version) to iSoftBet's 3888 Ways of the Dragon (as you can see, the number 8 is particularly appreciated in this type of slot). For experienced gamblers who are familiar with the world of slot games, 88 Fortunes is a classic that shouldn't be missed.\n            ",

The RTP, or Return to Player, is 96%, which is about average for the online market. This means that, over time, for every €100 wagered by the players, the slot will release at least €96 in winnings.\n\n88 Fortunes: Customization Feature and Symbol Values\n\nPlayers can choose how many credits to use for each spin, ranging from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 88, unlocking 1 to 5 gold symbols respectively. This function can turn four of the symbols displayed in the game grid into gold; the cost of playing increases exponentially (by up to 11 times, depending on the value of our bet), but the same can be said for the value of the wins, which (in some cases) can reach a value twenty times greater than the original amount. It's up to the player to decide their own strategy to make the most of this customization feature offered by the slot.\n\n88 Fortunes: Eastern-Themed Design and Music\n\nLike most Chinese-themed slot games, red and gold dominate WMS's 88 Fortunes. The slot features an Oriental melody to set the mood, and players can choose how much gold they want displayed on the screen. While lacking a chromatic division between the game's frame and grid, players can enjoy all the features this title has to offer after some initial adjustment.\n\n88 Fortunes: Similar Slot Games\n\nThere are various slots with similar themes as 88 Fortunes, including Microgaming's 108 Heroes and iSoftBet's 3888 Ways of the Dragon. The Chinese world is a popular theme in online slots, and experienced gamblers shouldn't miss the classic 88 Fortunes.\n\n88 Fortunes: Recommendation and Target Audience\n\n88 Fortunes is a classic Chinese-themed slot game with customizable features that can offer great value for players who employ a strategic betting approach. With an RTP of 96%, players can expect decent returns over time. Fans of similar slots or Eastern themed games will find this a great addition to their gaming repertoire.\n\n        \n            ",

One of the most common themes, due to its strong ties to wealth and legends, is superstition and Eastern folklore - specifically Chinese folklore. WMS has chosen this exact theme for their slot game, 88 Fortunes; and we're going to explore it in detail in this review, starting with the visual aspect and moving on to the more technical aspects of the game.\n\n88 Fortunes: The Visuals\n\nAs is customary with Chinese-themed slot games, red and gold reign supreme within WMS's 88 Fortunes. Red dominates the game's interface and the grid itself, while gold is used in the various symbols and wins. We are free to choose how much gold we want displayed on the screen (as we'll see in the next part of the review). The slot doesn't feature a specific music, but an Oriental melody starts playing immediately as we take our first spin, allowing the player to get into the right mindset to play.\n\nFundamentally speaking, 88 Fortunes pays the price for not having a chromatic division between the game's frame and grid, making the first visual impact particularly heavy. However, once we've adjusted our eyes, we can enjoy all the features this title has to offer.\n\n88 Fortunes: The Gameplay\n\nLet's move on to the technical aspect of the game: to begin with, WMS's 88 Fortunes is a slot that uses a 5x3 mechanism, showing 15 symbols for each bet. The RTP, or Return to Player, is 96%, which is about average for the online market. This means that, over time, for every €100 wagered by the players, the slot will release at least €96 in winnings. Considering that the legal minimum is 90% and the maximum is usually less than 100% (otherwise, the slot won't generate any profit), 96% is not a value to be underestimated.\n\nContinuing to talk about gameplay mechanics, the slot presents some interesting ideas: on the left, we can choose how many credits to use for each spin, ranging from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 88, unlocking 1 to 5 gold symbols respectively. Essentially, this function can turn four of the symbols displayed in the game grid into gold; the cost of playing increases exponentially (by up to 11 times, depending on the value of our bet), but the same can be said for the value of the wins, which (in some cases) can reach a value twenty times greater than the original amount. It's up to the player to decide their own strategy to make the most of this customization feature offered by the slot.\n\nSlots Similar to 88 Fortunes\n\nAs previously mentioned, it's not uncommon to find the Eastern world (and specifically the Chinese world) in online slots, so we have various choices if we want to try similar games. Starting from Microgaming's 108 Heroes (also available in mobile version) to iSoftBet's 3888 Ways of the Dragon (as you can see, the number 8 is particularly appreciated in this type of slot). For experienced gamblers who are familiar with the world of slot games, 88 Fortunes is a classic that shouldn't be missed.\n            ",

One of the most common themes, due to its strong ties to wealth and legends, is superstition and Eastern folklore - specifically Chinese folklore. WMS has chosen this exact theme for their slot game, 88 Fortunes; and we're going to explore it in detail in this review, starting with the visual aspect and moving on to the more technical aspects of the game.\n\n88 Fortunes: The Visuals\n\nAs is customary with Chinese-themed slot games, red and gold reign supreme within WMS's 88 Fortunes. Red dominates the game's interface and the grid itself, while gold is used in the various symbols and wins. We are free to choose how much gold we want displayed on the screen (as we'll see in the next part of the review). The slot doesn't feature a specific music, but an Oriental melody starts playing immediately as we take our first spin, allowing the player to get into the right mindset to play.\n\nFundamentally speaking, 88 Fortunes pays the price for not having a chromatic division between the game's frame and grid, making the first visual impact particularly heavy. However, once we've adjusted our eyes, we can enjoy all the features this title has to offer.\n\n88 Fortunes: The Gameplay\n\nLet's move on to the technical aspect of the game: to begin with, WMS's 88 Fortunes is a slot that uses a 5x3 mechanism, showing 15 symbols for each bet. The RTP, or Return to Player, is 96%, which is about average for the online market. This means that, over time, for every €100 wagered by the players, the slot will release at least €96 in winnings. Considering that the legal minimum is 90% and the maximum is usually less than 100% (otherwise, the slot won't generate any profit), 96% is not a value to be underestimated.\n\nContinuing to talk about gameplay mechanics, the slot presents some interesting ideas: on the left, we can choose how many credits to use for each spin, ranging from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 88, unlocking 1 to 5 gold symbols respectively. Essentially, this function can turn four of the symbols displayed in the game grid into gold; the cost of playing increases exponentially (by up to 11 times, depending on the value of our bet), but the same can be said for the value of the wins, which (in some cases) can reach a value twenty times greater than the original amount. It's up to the player to decide their own strategy to make the most of this customization feature offered by the slot.\n\nSlots Similar to 88 Fortunes\n\nAs previously mentioned, it's not uncommon to find the Eastern world (and specifically the Chinese world) in online slots, so we have various choices if we want to try similar games. Starting from Microgaming's 108 Heroes (also available in mobile version) to iSoftBet's 3888 Ways of the Dragon (as you can see, the number 8 is particularly appreciated in this type of slot). For experienced gamblers who are familiar with the world of slot games, 88 Fortunes is a classic that shouldn't be missed.\n            ",
