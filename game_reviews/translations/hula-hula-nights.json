Symbols include the traditional playing cards (A, K, Q and J) in colorful, yet basic fonts, along with symbols that recall Hawaii such as hibiscus, lotus, gardenia, and two hula dancers. The Wild symbol is the smiling tiki, and the Scatter symbol is the words 'Hula Hula Nights' accompanied by a coconut. The Scatter symbol allows for free spins, during which additional symbols with a palm tree appear: the Collect symbols, which allow the player to accumulate winnings on the green reels. The green reels, called the Green Reels, can also appear randomly outside of free spins, making symbol combinations that start from a low win like playing cards, then medium with flowers and high with dancers.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nThe special symbols in Hula Hula Nights are the Wild symbol (the smiling tiki) and the Scatter symbol ('Hula Hula Nights' accompanied by a coconut). The Scatter symbol allows for free spins, during which additional symbols with a palm tree appear: the Collect symbols, which help the player accumulate winnings on the green reels.\n\nGraphics\n\nHula Nights has a very simple, almost essential graphic design. The game screen shows an illustration of a smiling dancer, and against the backdrop of some photos of Hawaiian beaches that turn shades of red and purple, the game grid seems to aim for simplicity with few details and special attention paid to the symbols. The playing cards (A, K, Q and J) are in colorful, yet basic fonts, and other symbols that recall Hawaii include hibiscus, lotus, gardenia, and two hula dancers. The slot game also features music with sounds of ukuleles and drums, which is what we would expect in an online slot with a Hawaii theme.\n\nPaylines\n\nHula Nights is played on a 5x3 grid with 10 paylines.\n\nSimilar Slots\n\nOther slot games with a Hawaiian theme include Hawaiian Dream, Hawaiian Vacation, Island Heat, Waikiki Heroes, and The Real King Aloha, which is centered on the unforgettable Elvis Presley.\n\n        \n            ",

Both in terms of graphics and gameplay, the Hula Nights slot seems to be based on pure simplicity. The special symbols are the smiling tiki that represents the Wild and the words \"Hula Hula Nights\" accompanied by a coconut, which is the Scatter symbol. The Scatter symbol allows for free spins, which make additional symbols with a palm tree appear: the Collect symbols, which allow you to accumulate winnings on the green reels. These green reels, called the Green Reels, can also appear randomly outside of free spins, making symbol combinations that start from a low win like playing cards, then medium with flowers and high with dancers. Hula Nights is a simple and intuitive slot, although it doesn't stand out in terms of original bonus modes.\n\nSymbols\n\nOn the reels, we will see the inevitable symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q and J) in colorful but essential fonts, as well as symbols that recall Hawaii such as the faces of two hula dancers (even if they are actually the same but with different flowers in their hair) and typical flowers of the archipelago such as hibiscus, lotus and gardenia.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nThe special symbols are the smiling tiki that represents the Wild and the words \"Hula Hula Nights\" accompanied by a coconut, which is the Scatter symbol. The Scatter symbol allows for free spins, which make additional symbols with a palm tree appear: the Collect symbols, which allow you to accumulate winnings on the green reels.\n\nGraphics\n\nAgainst the backdrop of some photos of Hawaiian beaches that turn shades of red and purple, the game grid seems to aim for simplicity with few details and special attention paid to the symbols. Hula Nights has a very simple, almost essential graphics. In some ways, it doesn't particularly stand out, such as the background, which is literally just modified photos, and the music that's a little too predictable, but overall it's an enjoyable slot to watch.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nThe wonderful Hawaiian islands also come to life in other interesting online slots such as Hawaiian Dream, Hawaiian Vacation, Island Heat, the fun Waikiki Heroes or The Real King Aloha, centered on the unforgettable Elvis Presley.\n\n        \n            ",

White sandy beaches, perhaps shaded by palm trees, and the vast ocean in shades of blue and turquoise that blend into the clear sky. But if you can't travel to Hawaii, playing slots can make you feel like you're there.\n\nHula Nights from Bencrest allows us to virtually travel to a Hawaiian island and enjoy a performance of the famous hula dance. Our review will cover both the aesthetic and technical aspects of Hula Nights.\n\nHula Nights - Graphics\n\nThis first point of the review will discuss the graphic design of Hula Nights. What can we expect as soon as we see the game screen? After loading with a beautiful illustration of a smiling dancer, we will have our game grid in front of us.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of some photos of Hawaiian beaches that turn shades of red and purple, the game grid seems to aim for simplicity with few details and special attention paid to the symbols.\n\nOn the reels, we will see the inevitable symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q and J) in colorful but essential fonts, as well as symbols that recall Hawaii such as the faces of two hula dancers (even if they are actually the same but with different flowers in their hair) and typical flowers of the archipelago such as hibiscus, lotus and gardenia.\n\nThe musical accompaniment of Hula Nights is what you would expect in an online slot with a Hawaii theme, with sounds of ukuleles and drums.\n\nHula Nights has a very simple, almost essential graphics. In some ways, it doesn't particularly stand out, such as the background, which is literally just modified photos, and the music that's a little too predictable, but overall it's an enjoyable slot to watch.\n\nHula Nights - Gameplay\n\nHula Nights is played on a 5x3 grid with 10 paylines. Both in terms of graphics and gameplay, the Hula Nights slot seems to be based on pure simplicity.\n\nThe special symbols are the smiling tiki that represents the Wild and the words \"Hula Hula Nights\" accompanied by a coconut, which is the Scatter symbol. The Scatter symbol allows for free spins, which make additional symbols with a palm tree appear: the Collect symbols, which allow you to accumulate winnings on the green reels.\n\nThese green reels, called the Green Reels, can also appear randomly outside of free spins, making symbol combinations that start from a low win like playing cards, then medium with flowers and high with dancers.\n\nHula Nights is a simple and intuitive slot, although it doesn't stand out in terms of original bonus modes.\n\nSlots similar to Hula Nights\n\nThe wonderful Hawaiian islands also come to life in other interesting online slots such as Hawaiian Dream, Hawaiian Vacation, Island Heat, the fun Waikiki Heroes or The Real King Aloha, centered on the unforgettable Elvis Presley.\n        ",
