Cosa significa che un gioco ha una volatilità media? Significa che i premi sono abbastanza costanti, ma che se si aspira ad ottenere delle vincite di un certo livello occorre armarsi di pazienza perché queste non sono molto frequenti.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Macau High Roller\nI simboli che si alternano sui rulli di Macau High Roller sono sia tematici che non, ma tutti rappresentati in maniera fedele rispetto al tema.\nLe carte da gioco dal J all’Asso sono colorati e luccicanti e pagano fino a 100 volte il valore del gettone, mentre i simboli tematici, la roulette, l’auto da corsa, il tavolo da poker e una bella donna, regalano premi fino a 2.000 volte il valore del gettone.\nIl simbolo Scatter è una valigetta con inciso il simbolo del dollaro e permette di ottenere fino a 15 Free Spins, in cui sono attivi solo dei simboli speciali (Cash Chip) che vengono poi accumulati nel rullo di destra. Per i giocatori più impavidi, con Macau High Roller è possibile giocare con l’High Roller Bet, in cui sono attivi sia i simboli ordinari sia i Cash Chips.\n",

This slot machine could be considered a game made specifically for gamblers: the theme of Macau High Roller is the world of casinos, highlighting typical aspects such as beautiful women, cards, luxury machines, and green tables. The initial screen opens with the game title framed in a bright billboard, while in the background you can see the thousand lights and buildings of Las Vegas.\n\nThe game screen is very simple, with the reels simply framed in a golden border and colored symbols that stand out on a dark background. Although the graphics are nothing exceptional, we find that they are still well-made. If you are looking for a linear slot machine that offers a pleasant gaming experience, without going overboard, then Macau High Roller may be the right one for you!\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nMacau High Roller appears as a slot machine with a fairly traditional structure but with some details that make it particularly interesting: the rows are three but the reels are five plus one, with the sixth reel having special functions. This slot machine is called Macau High Roller and there is a reason for it: although the betting options start at just 10 cents per spin, thanks to the sixth reel, the special High Roller Bet function can be activated, allowing you to bet up to 200 coins, making high rollers happy.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player of this slot machine is not too satisfying at 95.88%, slightly below average, while regarding volatility, Macau High Roller is a medium variance slot. What does it mean for a game to have medium volatility? It means that prizes are fairly constant, but if you aspire to get winnings of a certain level, you have to be patient because they are not very frequent.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Macau High Roller\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Macau High Roller are both thematic and not, but all are faithfully represented with respect to the theme. The playing cards from J to Ace are colorful and shiny and pay up to 100 times the value of the token, while the thematic symbols, the roulette, the racing car, the poker table, and a beautiful woman, can give prizes up to 2,000 times the value of the token.\n\nThe Scatter symbol is a suitcase with the dollar symbol engraved on it and allows you to get up to 15 Free Spins, in which only special symbols (Cash Chip) are active and then accumulate in the right-hand reel. For the bravest players, with Macau High Roller it is possible to play with the High Roller Bet, in which both the regular symbols and the Cash Chips are active.\n            ",

This slot machine could be considered a game made specifically for gamblers: the theme of Macau High Roller is the world of casinos, highlighting typical aspects such as beautiful women, cards, luxury machines, and green tables. The initial screen opens with the game title framed in a bright billboard, while in the background you can see the thousand lights and buildings of Las Vegas.\n\nThe game screen is very simple, with the reels simply framed in a golden border and colored symbols that stand out on a dark background. Although the graphics are nothing exceptional, we find that they are still well-made. If you are looking for a linear slot machine that offers a pleasant gaming experience, without going overboard, then Macau High Roller may be the right one for you!\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nMacau High Roller appears as a slot machine with a fairly traditional structure but with some details that make it particularly interesting: the rows are three but the reels are five plus one, with the sixth reel having special functions. This slot machine is called Macau High Roller and there is a reason for it: although the betting options start at just 10 cents per spin, thanks to the sixth reel, the special High Roller Bet function can be activated, allowing you to bet up to 200 coins, making high rollers happy.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player of this slot machine is not too satisfying at 95.88%, slightly below average, while regarding volatility, Macau High Roller is a medium variance slot. What does it mean for a game to have medium volatility? It means that prizes are fairly constant, but if you aspire to get winnings of a certain level, you have to be patient because they are not very frequent.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Macau High Roller\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Macau High Roller are both thematic and not, but all are faithfully represented with respect to the theme. The playing cards from J to Ace are colorful and shiny and pay up to 100 times the value of the token, while the thematic symbols, the roulette, the racing car, the poker table, and a beautiful woman, can give prizes up to 2,000 times the value of the token.\n\nThe Scatter symbol is a suitcase with the dollar symbol engraved on it and allows you to get up to 15 Free Spins, in which only special symbols (Cash Chip) are active and then accumulate in the right-hand reel. For the bravest players, with Macau High Roller it is possible to play with the High Roller Bet, in which both the regular symbols and the Cash Chips are active.\n            ",
