The game is set against a backdrop of a snowy country built near a temple dedicated to the griffin. The game grid is surrounded by grapevines, and the symbols on the five reels are all related to Greek mythology such as winged horses, unicorns, satyrs, and the Medusa. The game has an archaic flavor and features epic and sacred music. The graphics and sound are of high quality and give the game an exquisite look and feel.\n\nGriffin's Quest Reel and Pay Lines\n\nGriffin's Quest features a unique game mechanism with five reels of variable length. The two reels at the extremes have four symbols, the two intern ones have five, and the central one has six symbols. The game has 2,400 pay lines, which is a huge number and provides many opportunities for players to win. The RTP of the game is 97.52%, which is high and offers players a great chance of winning.\n\nGriffin's Quest Volatility\n\nGriffin's Quest has a very high volatility. This means that there will be many spins with meager winnings in view of a potential high payout later on. Players need to have a lot of patience and a generous bankroll to play this game and unlock its full potential. The game is more suited to long gaming sessions rather than a bite and run approach.\n\nGriffin's Quest Bonus Features\n\nGriffin's Quest has a varied gameplay that favors long gaming sessions rather than a bite and run approach. The shield with the griffin symbol is the Scatter symbol that triggers the bonus mode when at least three appear in a single play. Once unlocked, a reel will appear that assigns a random bonus such as a multiplier on the gain or free spins. The bonus mode is an excellent opportunity for players to win big in this high-volatility game.\n\nOther Slots that may interest Griffin's Quest players\n\nIf players particularly love the mythological figure of the griffin, we recommend two other slots that propose it in a different way: Griffins Throne and Beat The Beast Griffin's Gold. These games are also based on Greek mythology and feature the griffin as a prominent character. Griffin's Throne is a high-volatility game with a 96.24% RTP, and Beat The Beast Griffin's Gold is a medium-volatility game with a 96.14% RTP. Both games offer players a chance to win big while enjoying an exciting gameplay experience.\n\n        \n            ",

It features the mythological creature, griffin, known for its incredible abilities and legendary strength. The game has a Christmas version but the review focuses on the original version.\n\nKalamba Games\n\nKalamba Games is the developer of Griffin's Quest and many other slot games. Griffin's Quest has five reels with variable length and 2,400 pay lines. The RTP is 97.52%, with very high volatility, making gameplay long and rewarding.\n\nGame mechanics\n\nGriffin's Quest uses a peculiar game mechanism with 24 symbols in total, featuring figures from mythology, particularly Greek mythology, including the griffin, winged horses, unicorns, satyrs, and the terrible Medusa. The slot has a snow-covered game grid with a background of a temple dedicated to the griffin itself. The music is epic and sacred, fitting the archaic flavor of the game. The symbols move inside the grapevine-surrounded game grid, and the reels positioned at the extremes show four symbols, while the two intern reels show five, and the central one six symbols.\n\nBonus features\n\nIn Griffin's Quest,  the shield with the griffin symbol is the Scatter symbol that allows players to access the bonus mode. Players need to find at least three in a single play to unlock the mode. Once unlocked, a reel appears that assigns a random bonus, which can be a multiplier on the gain, free spins, or something else. Griffin's Quest has a varied gameplay, favoring long gaming sessions rather than bite-and-run approach.\n\nVolatility\n\nGriffin's Quest has a very high volatility, meaning players can expect to have many spins with meager winnings for a potential high payout later on. Players who particularly love the mythological figure of the griffin may also enjoy two other slots that propose it differently, like Griffins Throne and Beat The Beast Griffin's Gold.\n\n        \n            ",

Just like Kalamba Games did, with its online slot Griffin’s Quest.\n\nThe griffin, a creature born from the cross between an eagle and a lion, with incredible abilities and legendary strength, accompanies us through the various plays in this slot different from the others.\n\nIn today's review, we will try to give you a precise image of what to expect when opening this title, so that you can decide if it meets your videoludic needs.\n\nThe Hour of the Griffin\n\nLet's start by talking about the graphic and sound aspect: the game grid has as a background a snow-covered country built on the slopes of a temple dedicated to the griffin itself. We also remember that there is a Christmas version of the same slot, but today we will focus on the original.\n\nThe game grid is surrounded by grapevines and inside it, the numerous symbols that will make up the winning combinations move, all accompanied by epic and sacred music, which gives the right pathos to this slot with an archaic flavor.\n\nThe symbols recall figures from mythology, particularly Greek mythology: in addition to the griffin, we find winged horses, unicorns, satyrs, the terrible Medusa, and much more.\n\nAn exquisite slot from a stylistic point of view, which also reserves surprises in its game mechanics.\n\nHow does Griffin's Quest work?\n\nLet's talk about the aspect that interests our players the most: how does Griffin's Quest behave from a technical point of view? The slot uses a rather peculiar game mechanism: we find five reels (like in most online titles) of variable length. In fact, those positioned at the extremes show four symbols inside them, the two intern ones show five, and the central one even six.\n\nThe symbols are therefore 24 in total, in line with other titles from Kalamba Games, the RTP (i.e. the player's return rate) is 97.52%, with very high volatility, and 2,400 pay lines.\n\nThe volatility, in particular, prepares us for a large number of spins with meager winnings in view of a potential high payout later on.\n\nThe shield with the griffin symbol is the Scatter symbol that allows us to access the bonus mode, if we manage to find at least three in a single play.

Just like Kalamba Games did, with its online slot Griffin’s Quest.\n\nThe griffin, a creature born from the cross between an eagle and a lion, with incredible abilities and legendary strength, accompanies us through the various plays in this slot different from the others.\n\nIn today's review, we will try to give you a precise image of what to expect when opening this title, so that you can decide if it meets your videoludic needs.\n\nThe Hour of the Griffin\n\nLet's start by talking about the graphic and sound aspect: the game grid has as a background a snow-covered country built on the slopes of a temple dedicated to the griffin itself. We also remember that there is a Christmas version of the same slot, but today we will focus on the original.\n\nThe game grid is surrounded by grapevines and inside it, the numerous symbols that will make up the winning combinations move, all accompanied by epic and sacred music, which gives the right pathos to this slot with an archaic flavor.\n\nThe symbols recall figures from mythology, particularly Greek mythology: in addition to the griffin, we find winged horses, unicorns, satyrs, the terrible Medusa, and much more.\n\nAn exquisite slot from a stylistic point of view, which also reserves surprises in its game mechanics.\n\nHow does Griffin's Quest work?\n\nLet's talk about the aspect that interests our players the most: how does Griffin's Quest behave from a technical point of view? The slot uses a rather peculiar game mechanism: we find five reels (like in most online titles) of variable length. In fact, those positioned at the extremes show four symbols inside them, the two intern ones show five, and the central one even six.\n\nThe symbols are therefore 24 in total, in line with other titles from Kalamba Games, the RTP (i.e. the player's return rate) is 97.52%, with very high volatility, and 2,400 pay lines.\n\nThe volatility, in particular, prepares us for a large number of spins with meager winnings in view of a potential high payout later on.\n\nThe shield with the griffin symbol is the Scatter symbol that allows us to access the bonus mode, if we manage to find at least three in a single play. Once unlocked, a reel will appear before us that will assign us a random bonus: this can be a multiplier on the gain, free spins, or something else.\n\nA varied gameplay, therefore, that favors long gaming sessions rather than a bite and run approach.\n\nSlots similar to Griffin’s Quest\n\nIf you particularly love the mythological figure of the griffin, we recommend two other slots that propose it in a different way: Griffins Throne and Beat The Beast Griffin’s Gold.\n        ",
