The 4x4 grid uses a Scatter Pays mechanic to award wins, meaning you don't have to land matching symbols in specific positions or patterns. All you need is 10 or more of the same symbol to win big.\n\nWith an RTP of 96.19%, Burning Sun is in line with most modern online slots. However, it's worth noting the game's volatility. Unlike other providers, Wazdan included an adjustable volatility setting that allows players to modify the underlying gameplay. You can choose from three options (Low, Standard, and High) by clicking the chili pepper symbol beside the selection button. More chili peppers indicate higher volatility. The betting range for the game is from €0.10 to €100.\n\nWazdan has infused Burning Sun's gameplay with several unique features and mechanics. The game's base is equipped with new elements, but the main attraction is the Hold the Jackpot Respin bonus game. Let's take a closer look:\n\nScatter Pays - Instead of using a traditional payline structure, Burning Sun includes a Scatter Pays mechanic. All you need is 10-16 matching symbols to land anywhere on the reels to win big.\n\nWilds - The wild symbol substitutes all standard icons on the Paytable to help create winning combinations. However, it cannot be used with Bonus symbols to activate the Hold the Jackpot feature.\n\nSticky to Infinity - The feature that sets this video slot apart from other Burning series games is the new Sticky to Infinity mechanic. During the base game, landing a Mystery or Jackpot Mystery Bonus symbol with the Sticky to Infinity logo increases your chances of triggering the Hold the Jackpot bonus game by permanently sticking to the reels.\n\nBurning Sun does not offer traditional free spins since the main feature of this online slot game is the Hold the Jackpot bonus game. However, players receive a Respin bonus that significantly improves their chances of winning more significant prizes. To activate it, you need to land at least six Bonus symbols of any kind. The bonus game continues until you run out of respins, or all reels are filled with Bonus icons. From these symbols, you can win Cash, Jackpot Mystery (Mini, Minor, and Major), and Collectibles.\n\nFinally, if you're lucky enough to land 16 Bonus symbols, covering the entire grid during the bonus game, you'll win the Grand Jackpot worth 5,000 times your bet. Check the game's official Paytable to see the payout for each symbol.\n\nIn conclusion, Wazdan has recently launched a selection of fun slots, and I'm sure Burning Sun will be another hit amongst fans of this series, particularly those who prefer a less complicated approach to online slots gameplay. Graphically, the game has some room for improvement, but its features are nothing to scoff at. The Hold the Jackpot bonus game activation requirement doesn't seem overly demanding, especially considering the game's sticky symbols and respins from the base game. Moreover, the prospect of multiple jackpots and a maximum win of 5,000 times your bet upon accessing the feature will surely get your adrenaline pumping!\n\nFAQs:\nWhat is the most valuable symbol in Burning Sun?\nThe most valuable symbol is the Seven with multipliers of 2x, 4x, 8x, 15x, 30x, 100x, and 200x.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the Burning Sun online slot?\nThe RTP of Burning Sun is 96.19%.

It takes players on a cosmic journey in search of massive wins and multiple fixed jackpots. The game boasts a new Sticky to Infinity feature, along with respins, wilds, and a Hold the Jackpot bonus that could award up to 5,000 times your bet at one of our top online casinos.\n\nPlaying the flaming Burning Sun slot game is a breeze despite its unique features and mechanics. The 4x4 grid uses a Scatter Pays mechanic to award wins, meaning you don't have to land matching symbols in specific positions or patterns. All you need is 10 or more of the same symbol to win big.\n\nWith an RTP of 96.19%, Burning Sun is in line with most modern online slots. However, it's worth noting the game's volatility. Unlike other providers, Wazdan included an adjustable volatility setting that allows players to modify the underlying gameplay. You can choose from three options (Low, Standard, and High) by clicking the chili pepper symbol beside the selection button. More chili peppers indicate higher volatility. The betting range for the game is from €0.10 to €100.\n\nWazdan has infused Burning Sun's gameplay with several unique features and mechanics. The game's base is equipped with new elements, but the main attraction is the Hold the Jackpot Respin bonus game. Let's take a closer look:\n\nScatter Pays - Instead of using a traditional payline structure, Burning Sun includes a Scatter Pays mechanic. All you need is 10-16 matching symbols to land anywhere on the reels to win big.\n\nWilds - The wild symbol substitutes all standard icons on the Paytable to help create winning combinations. However, it cannot be used with Bonus symbols to activate the Hold the Jackpot feature.\n\nSticky to Infinity - The feature that sets this video slot apart from other Burning series games is the new Sticky to Infinity mechanic. During the base game, landing a Mystery or Jackpot Mystery Bonus symbol with the Sticky to Infinity logo increases your chances of triggering the Hold the Jackpot bonus game by permanently sticking to the reels.\n\nBurning Sun does not offer traditional free spins since the main feature of this online slot game is the Hold the Jackpot bonus game. However, players receive a Respin bonus that significantly improves their chances of winning more significant prizes. To activate it, you need to land at least six Bonus symbols of any kind. The bonus game continues until you run out of respins, or all reels are filled with Bonus icons. From these symbols, you can win Cash, Jackpot Mystery (Mini, Minor, and Major), and Collectibles.\n\nFinally, if you're lucky enough to land 16 Bonus symbols, covering the entire grid during the bonus game, you'll win the Grand Jackpot worth 5,000 times your bet. Check the game's official Paytable to see the payout for each symbol.\n\nIn conclusion, Wazdan has recently launched a selection of fun slots, and I'm sure Burning Sun will be another hit amongst fans of this series, particularly those who prefer a less complicated approach to online slots gameplay. Graphically, the game has some room for improvement, but its features are nothing to scoff at. The Hold the Jackpot bonus game activation requirement doesn't seem overly demanding, especially considering the game's sticky symbols and respins from the base game. Moreover, the prospect of multiple jackpots and a maximum win of 5,000 times your bet upon accessing the feature will surely get your adrenaline pumping!\n\nFAQs:\nWhat is the most valuable symbol in Burning Sun?\nThe most valuable symbol is the Seven with multipliers of 2x, 4x, 8x, 15x, 30x, 100x, and 200x.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the Burning Sun online slot?\nThe RTP of Burning Sun is 96.19%. It's a medium volatility slot, and you can try it out for free on Slotjava.\n\nCan I activate the free spins bonus feature in Burning Sun?\nYes, Burning Sun offers free spins for all budgets. Additionally, there are many other fantastic features like Autoplay, Scatter, Wild, and the exciting Hold the Jackpot bonus game.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nBurning Sun's unique features and mechanics\nHold the Jackpot Respin bonus game\nSticky to Infinity feature\nScatter Pays mechanic\nMaximum win potential\nGraphics and design quality\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Burning Sun: A Game Review for Experienced Gamblers\n\nExperience the fiery adventure with Burning Sun - the latest addition to Wazdan's Hold the Jackpot series. It takes players on a cosmic journey in search of massive wins and multiple fixed jackpots. The game boasts a new Sticky to Infinity feature, along with respins, wilds, and a Hold the Jackpot bonus that could award up to 5,000 times your bet at one of our top online casinos.\n\nPlaying the flaming Burning Sun slot game is a breeze despite its unique features and mechanics. The 4x4 grid uses a Scatter Pays mechanic to award wins, meaning you don't have to land matching symbols in specific positions or patterns. All you need is 10 or more of the same symbol to win big.\n\nWith an RTP of 96.19%, Burning Sun is in line with most modern online slots. However, it's worth noting the game's volatility. Unlike other providers, Wazdan included an adjustable volatility setting that allows players to modify the underlying gameplay. You can choose from three options (Low, Standard, and High) by clicking the chili pepper symbol beside the selection button. More chili peppers indicate higher volatility. The betting range for the game is from €0.10 to €100.\n\nWazdan has infused Burning Sun's gameplay with several unique features and mechanics. The game's base is equipped with new elements, but the main attraction is the Hold the Jackpot Respin bonus game. Let's take a closer look:\n\nScatter Pays - Instead of using a traditional payline structure, Burning Sun includes a Scatter Pays mechanic. All you need is 10-16 matching symbols to land anywhere on the reels to win big.\n\nWilds - The wild symbol substitutes all standard icons on the Paytable to help create winning combinations. However, it cannot be used with Bonus symbols to activate the Hold the Jackpot feature.\n\nSticky to Infinity - The feature that sets this video slot apart from other Burning series games is the new Sticky to Infinity mechanic. During the base game, landing a Mystery or Jackpot Mystery Bonus symbol with the Sticky to Infinity logo increases your chances of triggering the Hold the Jackpot bonus game by permanently sticking to the reels.\n\nBurning Sun does not offer traditional free spins since the main feature of this online slot game is the Hold the Jackpot bonus game. However, players receive a Respin bonus that significantly improves their chances of winning more significant prizes. To activate it, you need to land at least six Bonus symbols of any kind. The bonus game continues until you run out of respins, or all reels are filled with Bonus icons. From these symbols, you can win Cash, Jackpot Mystery (Mini, Minor, and Major), and Collectibles.\n\nFinally, if you're lucky enough to land 16 Bonus symbols, covering the entire grid during the bonus game, you'll win the Grand Jackpot worth 5,000 times your bet. Check the game's official Paytable to see the payout for each symbol.\n\nIn conclusion, Wazdan has recently launched a selection of fun slots, and I'm sure Burning Sun will be another hit amongst fans of this series, particularly those who prefer a less complicated approach to online slots gameplay. Graphically, the game has some room for improvement, but its features are nothing to scoff at. The Hold the Jackpot bonus game activation requirement doesn't seem overly demanding, especially considering the game's sticky symbols and respins from the base game. Moreover, the prospect of multiple jackpots and a maximum win of 5,000 times your bet upon accessing the feature will surely get your adrenaline pumping!\n\nFAQs:\nWhat is the most valuable symbol in Burning Sun?\nThe most valuable symbol is the Seven with multipliers of 2x, 4x, 8x, 15x, 30x, 100x, and 200x.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the Burning Sun online slot?\nThe RTP of Burning Sun is 96.19%. It's a medium volatility slot, and you can try it out for free on Slotjava.\n\nCan I activate the free spins bonus feature in Burning Sun?\nYes, Burning Sun offers free spins for all budgets. Additionally, there are many other fantastic features like Autoplay, Scatter, Wild, and the exciting Hold the Jackpot bonus game.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics\n\nBurning Sun features a 4x4 grid that uses a Scatter Pays mechanic that awards wins when you land ten or more of the same symbols anywhere on the reels. Players can choose from three different volatility levels (Low, Standard, and High). The game's RTP is 96.19%, and the betting range is from €0.10 to €100.\n\nUnique Features\n\nBurning Sun comes with several unique features and mechanics, including the Hold the Jackpot Respin bonus, wilds, and the new Sticky to Infinity feature. The Sticky to Infinity bonus makes it more likely to trigger the Hold the Jackpot feature during the base game. The newer features, in combination with the Scatter Pays mechanic, provide an entirely different slot experience.\n\nHold the Jackpot Respin Bonus Game\n\nThe Hold the Jackpot Respin bonus game is the main feature of Burning Sun. To activate, land at least six Bonus symbols to start the bonus game. Collecting Bonus symbols during this round can get you Cash, Jackpot Mystery, and Collectibles. Landing sixteen Bonus symbols can reward you with the Grand Jackpot worth 5,000 times your bet.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nWith an RTP of 96.19%, players can expect to see reasonable returns on investment. The game is of medium volatility, and the betting range is from €0.10 to €100. Players can potentially win up to 5,000 times their bet through the Hold the Jackpot Respin Bonus game and the multiple fixed jackpots available.\n\nGraphical Design\n\nBurning Sun's graphics are not the best Wazdan has to offer, with only a few animations and graphics. However, it does offer a cosmic feel that matches the game's space theme and works well with the audio and gameplay. The game's design is focusing more on creating an entertaining and exciting gambling experience than visual details.\n\nAccessibility and Ease of Play\n\nDespite the unique gameplay and mechanics, Burning Sun is easy to play. The game's user interface is intuitive, and the controls are easy to manage. Burning Sun is instant-play and available on mobile devices and desktops, allowing players to enjoy the game anywhere and anytime. The adjustable volatility setting also lets players adjust the gameplay according to personal preferences.\n\n        \n            ",

The game also comes equipped with an adjustable volatility setting (Low, Standard, and High), and a betting range of €0.10 to €100. The base game features new elements, while the Hold the Jackpot Respin feature offers players the chance to win up to 5,000 times their bet at a top online casino.\n\nHold the Jackpot Respin Bonus Game\n\nBurning Sun does not offer traditional free spins. Instead, players receive a Respin bonus when landing at least six Bonus symbols of any kind. The Hold the Jackpot feature grants players access to Cash, Jackpot Mystery (Mini, Minor, and Major), and Collectibles. To activate the Hold the Jackpot feature, you need to collect bonus symbols with the Sticky to Infinity logo, which permanently sticks them to the reels and increases your chances of triggering the bonus game.\n\nSticky to Infinity Feature\n\nThe new Sticky to Infinity mechanic is one of Burning Sun's unique features. When landing a Mystery or Jackpot Mystery Bonus symbol with the Sticky to Infinity logo during the base game, the symbol sticks to the reels, increasing your chances of accessing the Hold the Jackpot bonus game.\n\nScatter Pays Mechanic\n\nBurning Sun uses a Scatter Pays mechanic, meaning players don't have to land matching symbols in specific patterns. All you need is 10 or more matching symbols anywhere on the reels to win big.\n\nMaximum Win Potential\n\nIf a player lands 16 Bonus symbols during the Hold the Jackpot feature on all reels, they could win the Grand Jackpot worth 5,000 times their bet. It's also worth noting that each symbol has its own payout, so check the game's official Paytable to see each symbol's value.\n\nGraphics and Design Quality\n\nGraphically, Burning Sun has some room for improvement. However, the game's unique features and the Hold the Jackpot bonus game more than make up for it. The game's activation requirements aren't overly demanding, and the sticky symbols from the base game add an extra level of excitement to the gameplay.\n\n        \n            ",

The game boasts a new Sticky to Infinity feature, along with respins, wilds, and a Hold the Jackpot bonus that could award up to 5,000 times your bet at one of our top online casinos.\n\nPlaying the flaming Burning Sun slot game is a breeze despite its unique features and mechanics. The 4x4 grid uses a Scatter Pays mechanic to award wins, meaning you don't have to land matching symbols in specific positions or patterns. All you need is 10 or more of the same symbol to win big.\n\nWith an RTP of 96.19%, Burning Sun is in line with most modern online slots. However, it's worth noting the game's volatility. Unlike other providers, Wazdan included an adjustable volatility setting that allows players to modify the underlying gameplay. You can choose from three options (Low, Standard, and High) by clicking the chili pepper symbol beside the selection button. More chili peppers indicate higher volatility. The betting range for the game is from €0.10 to €100.\n\nWazdan has infused Burning Sun's gameplay with several unique features and mechanics. The game's base is equipped with new elements, but the main attraction is the Hold the Jackpot Respin bonus game. Let's take a closer look:\n\nScatter Pays - Instead of using a traditional payline structure, Burning Sun includes a Scatter Pays mechanic. All you need is 10-16 matching symbols to land anywhere on the reels to win big.\n\nWilds - The wild symbol substitutes all standard icons on the Paytable to help create winning combinations. However, it cannot be used with Bonus symbols to activate the Hold the Jackpot feature.\n\nSticky to Infinity - The feature that sets this video slot apart from other Burning series games is the new Sticky to Infinity mechanic. During the base game, landing a Mystery or Jackpot Mystery Bonus symbol with the Sticky to Infinity logo increases your chances of triggering the Hold the Jackpot bonus game by permanently sticking to the reels.\n\nBurning Sun does not offer traditional free spins since the main feature of this online slot game is the Hold the Jackpot bonus game. However, players receive a Respin bonus that significantly improves their chances of winning more significant prizes. To activate it, you need to land at least six Bonus symbols of any kind.

Check the game's official Paytable to see the payout for each symbol.\n\nIn conclusion, Wazdan has recently launched a selection of fun slots, and I'm sure Burning Sun will be another hit amongst fans of this series, particularly those who prefer a less complicated approach to online slots gameplay. Graphically, the game has some room for improvement, but its features are nothing to scoff at. The Hold the Jackpot bonus game activation requirement doesn't seem overly demanding, especially considering the game's sticky symbols and respins from the base game. Moreover, the prospect of multiple jackpots and a maximum win of 5,000 times your bet upon accessing the feature will surely get your adrenaline pumping!\n\nFAQs:\nWhat is the most valuable symbol in Burning Sun?\nThe most valuable symbol is the Seven with multipliers of 2x, 4x, 8x, 15x, 30x, 100x, and 200x.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the Burning Sun online slot?\nThe RTP of Burning Sun is 96.19%. It's a medium volatility slot, and you can try it out for free on Slotjava.\n\nCan I activate the free spins bonus feature in Burning Sun?\nYes, Burning Sun offers free spins for all budgets. Additionally, there are many other fantastic features like Autoplay, Scatter, Wild, and the exciting Hold the Jackpot bonus game.\n            ",

It takes players on a cosmic journey in search of massive wins and multiple fixed jackpots. The game boasts a new Sticky to Infinity feature, along with respins, wilds, and a Hold the Jackpot bonus that could award up to 5,000 times your bet at one of our top online casinos.\n\nPlaying the flaming Burning Sun slot game is a breeze despite its unique features and mechanics. The 4x4 grid uses a Scatter Pays mechanic to award wins, meaning you don't have to land matching symbols in specific positions or patterns. All you need is 10 or more of the same symbol to win big.\n\nWith an RTP of 96.19%, Burning Sun is in line with most modern online slots. However, it's worth noting the game's volatility. Unlike other providers, Wazdan included an adjustable volatility setting that allows players to modify the underlying gameplay. You can choose from three options (Low, Standard, and High) by clicking the chili pepper symbol beside the selection button. More chili peppers indicate higher volatility. The betting range for the game is from €0.10 to €100.\n\nWazdan has infused Burning Sun's gameplay with several unique features and mechanics. The game's base is equipped with new elements, but the main attraction is the Hold the Jackpot Respin bonus game. Let's take a closer look:\n\nScatter Pays - Instead of using a traditional payline structure, Burning Sun includes a Scatter Pays mechanic. All you need is 10-16 matching symbols to land anywhere on the reels to win big.\n\nWilds - The wild symbol substitutes all standard icons on the Paytable to help create winning combinations. However, it cannot be used with Bonus symbols to activate the Hold the Jackpot feature.\n\nSticky to Infinity - The feature that sets this video slot apart from other Burning series games is the new Sticky to Infinity mechanic. During the base game, landing a Mystery or Jackpot Mystery Bonus symbol with the Sticky to Infinity logo increases your chances of triggering the Hold the Jackpot bonus game by permanently sticking to the reels.\n\nBurning Sun does not offer traditional free spins since the main feature of this online slot game is the Hold the Jackpot bonus game. However, players receive a Respin bonus that significantly improves their chances of winning more significant prizes. To activate it, you need to land at least six Bonus symbols of any kind. The bonus game continues until you run out of respins, or all reels are filled with Bonus icons. From these symbols, you can win Cash, Jackpot Mystery (Mini, Minor, and Major), and Collectibles.\n\nFinally, if you're lucky enough to land 16 Bonus symbols, covering the entire grid during the bonus game, you'll win the Grand Jackpot worth 5,000 times your bet. Check the game's official Paytable to see the payout for each symbol.\n\nIn conclusion, Wazdan has recently launched a selection of fun slots, and I'm sure Burning Sun will be another hit amongst fans of this series, particularly those who prefer a less complicated approach to online slots gameplay. Graphically, the game has some room for improvement, but its features are nothing to scoff at. The Hold the Jackpot bonus game activation requirement doesn't seem overly demanding, especially considering the game's sticky symbols and respins from the base game. Moreover, the prospect of multiple jackpots and a maximum win of 5,000 times your bet upon accessing the feature will surely get your adrenaline pumping!\n\nFAQs:\nWhat is the most valuable symbol in Burning Sun?\nThe most valuable symbol is the Seven with multipliers of 2x, 4x, 8x, 15x, 30x, 100x, and 200x.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the Burning Sun online slot?\nThe RTP of Burning Sun is 96.19%.
