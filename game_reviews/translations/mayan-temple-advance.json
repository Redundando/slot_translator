The serene in-game music, primarily a pan flute playing lost melodies, adds relaxation during the inactive game phases. As the reels start rotating, the serenity is replaced with the rumble of drums, suggesting us into active combat with each spin.\n\nThe pre-Columbian temple archetype serves as the inspiration for the slot visuals, with rocks and plants climbing up the walls. The symbols, which alternate amidst golden totems and native ladies, have a distinct graphic style and color harmony that sets them apart from the usual choices.\n\nMayan Temple Advance: Technical Aspect\n\nThis slot follows the 5*3 layout common in online slots and has fifteen paylines to score wins. Mayan Temple Advance boasts a solid 95.09% RTP, meaning that players can win back 95% of their total bet.\n\nThe Temple Bonus Game is where the actual gold lies in this game.

The game was released in July 2019 and focuses on pre-Columbian populations that we will quickly analyze in our review.\n\nMayan Temple Advance: graphics and music\n\nThe eye wants its share and the ear too, which is why we focus on the aspect that we pay the most attention to during the first game. From a musical point of view, the game during the pause phases is accompanied by relaxing music, like a pan flute playing lost melodies. During the game itself, when the reels rotate on themselves, this music is replaced by the roar of drums, as if we were going to battle with our game.\n\nVisually, the slot recalls the archetype of the pre-Columbian temple: rocks and plants growing along the walls, as well as symbols that alternate between golden totems and native girls. The graphic style of the symbols may deviate from classic taste, but the slot still shows a good harmony of colors.\n\nMayan Temple Advance: technical aspect\n\nLet's move on to the game mechanics: first of all, we are facing a slot that uses a mechanism common to other Capecod titles. The 5*3 scheme is very present in online slots and the fifteen winning lines available in the game are typical of this development house.\n\nFrom a winning point of view, Mayan Temple Advance uses an RTP of 95.09%. What does this mean in plain words? RTP indicates the return per player, that is the amount of money issued as winnings (over the long term) in relation to the money played.\n\nIf in the past this value could be much lower and therefore it was very difficult to win, today by law the percentage must be at least 90%. A 95%, as in this case, is an excellent value that indicates that for every €100 played, on average, €95 are issued as winnings.\n\nThe best way to materialize a rich win is through the Temple Bonus Game: by obtaining 5 Scatter symbols (the skull) it is possible to access a multi-stage prize game that allows you to obtain huge winnings.\n\nSlots similar to Mayan Temple Advance\n\nAs we said earlier, it is not particularly rare to see pre-Columbian populations as the theme of a slot.

From a musical point of view, the game during the pause phases is accompanied by relaxing music, like a pan flute playing lost melodies. During the game itself, when the reels rotate on themselves, this music is replaced by the roar of drums, as if we were going to battle with our game.\n\nVisually, the slot recalls the archetype of the pre-Columbian temple: rocks and plants growing along the walls, as well as symbols that alternate between golden totems and native girls. The graphic style of the symbols may deviate from classic taste, but the slot still shows a good harmony of colors.\n\nMayan Temple Advance: technical aspect\n\nLet's move on to the game mechanics: first of all, we are facing a slot that uses a mechanism common to other Capecod titles. The 5*3 scheme is very present in online slots and the fifteen winning lines available in the game are typical of this development house.\n\nFrom a winning point of view, Mayan Temple Advance uses an RTP of 95.09%. What does this mean in plain words? RTP indicates the return per player, that is the amount of money issued as winnings (over the long term) in relation to the money played.\n\nIf in the past this value could be much lower and therefore it was very difficult to win, today by law the percentage must be at least 90%. A 95%, as in this case, is an excellent value that indicates that for every €100 played, on average, €95 are issued as winnings.\n\nThe best way to materialize a rich win is through the Temple Bonus Game: by obtaining 5 Scatter symbols (the skull) it is possible to access a multi-stage prize game that allows you to obtain huge winnings.\n\nSlots similar to Mayan Temple Advance\n\nAs we said earlier, it is not particularly rare to see pre-Columbian populations as the theme of a slot. Always staying on the Maya and with a common RTP of 95%, we can recommend Novomatic's Book of Maya or, changing population, Inca's Treasure, Inca Jackpot by Playtech, which can prove to be a winning choice thanks to its special functions.\n            ",

Few things in the world contain both these factors as our history, especially in those populations that once seemed unreachable and whose culture still influences our present today.\n\nLet's talk about the Maya, for example: it hasn't been that long since we all trembled at the thought of an impending end of the world prophesied by their calendar, not to mention the myth of Eldorado that guided the conquerors in their journeys of destruction. \n\nSo it's no surprise to see the Maya people as the protagonists of a slot and this is the case with Mayan Temple Advance by Capecod. The game was released in July 2019 and focuses on pre-Columbian populations that we will quickly analyze in our review.\n\nMayan Temple Advance: graphics and music\n\nThe eye wants its share and the ear too, which is why we focus on the aspect that we pay the most attention to during the first game. From a musical point of view, the game during the pause phases is accompanied by relaxing music, like a pan flute playing lost melodies. During the game itself, when the reels rotate on themselves, this music is replaced by the roar of drums, as if we were going to battle with our game.\n\nVisually, the slot recalls the archetype of the pre-Columbian temple: rocks and plants growing along the walls, as well as symbols that alternate between golden totems and native girls. The graphic style of the symbols may deviate from classic taste, but the slot still shows a good harmony of colors.\n\nMayan Temple Advance: technical aspect\n\nLet's move on to the game mechanics: first of all, we are facing a slot that uses a mechanism common to other Capecod titles. The 5*3 scheme is very present in online slots and the fifteen winning lines available in the game are typical of this development house.\n\nFrom a winning point of view, Mayan Temple Advance uses an RTP of 95.09%. What does this mean in plain words? RTP indicates the return per player, that is the amount of money issued as winnings (over the long term) in relation to the money played.\n\nIf in the past this value could be much lower and therefore it was very difficult to win, today by law the percentage must be at least 90%. A 95%, as in this case, is an excellent value that indicates that for every €100 played, on average, €95 are issued as winnings.\n\nThe best way to materialize a rich win is through the Temple Bonus Game: by obtaining 5 Scatter symbols (the skull) it is possible to access a multi-stage prize game that allows you to obtain huge winnings.\n\nSlots similar to Mayan Temple Advance\n\nAs we said earlier, it is not particularly rare to see pre-Columbian populations as the theme of a slot. Always staying on the Maya and with a common RTP of 95%, we can recommend Novomatic's Book of Maya or, changing population, Inca's Treasure, Inca Jackpot by Playtech, which can prove to be a winning choice thanks to its special functions.\n            ",

What does this mean in plain words? RTP indicates the return per player, that is the amount of money issued as winnings (over the long term) in relation to the money played.\n\nIf in the past this value could be much lower and therefore it was very difficult to win, today by law the percentage must be at least 90%. A 95%, as in this case, is an excellent value that indicates that for every €100 played, on average, €95 are issued as winnings.\n\nThe best way to materialize a rich win is through the Temple Bonus Game: by obtaining 5 Scatter symbols (the skull) it is possible to access a multi-stage prize game that allows you to obtain huge winnings.\n\nSlots similar to Mayan Temple Advance\n\nAs we said earlier, it is not particularly rare to see pre-Columbian populations as the theme of a slot. Always staying on the Maya and with a common RTP of 95%, we can recommend Novomatic's Book of Maya or, changing population, Inca's Treasure, Inca Jackpot by Playtech, which can prove to be a winning choice thanks to its special functions.\n        ",
