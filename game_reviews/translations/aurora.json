Alcuni hanno avuto modo di vederla davvero, ma tutti gli appassionati di slot potranno viverla da vicino attraverso questo gioco.\nI simboli del gioco prevedono il logo W, il troll, il logo della slot Aurora e le lettere/figure delle carte. La W è il Wild che va a sostituire tutte le icone del gioco: aiuterà così a formare le combinazioni regolari, purché i simboli siano presenti in quantità sufficiente per generare le combinazioni. Se trovi più Wild sulla griglia, riuscirà a pagare fino a 5 volte la scommessa effettuata, che è in tutto e per tutto il premio più alto della slot. Molto importante è anche l’altro Jolly del gioco, ovvero il Troll che ti farà accedere ai giri gratuiti se riempie completamente la bobina numero 3. Nel momento in cui si avviano i tuoi Free Spin si risveglia un troll che può muoversi in libertà sui rulli, da destra a sinistra, oppure dividersi. La funzione termina quando nel round game ti ritroverai senza più troll attivi. Aurora prevede un RTP fissato a 96,08%, che è nella media del mercato di gambling online.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Aurora\nSe hai voglia di provare un titolo molto semplice (per regole di gioco) e capace di garantire più vincite medio basse nel lungo periodo, allora ti conviene fermarti e provare subito la slot Aurora. Abbiamo riscontrato che oltre ad avere interessanti animazioni durante le rotazioni e buone funzioni, conta anche su un buon aspetto, utile per attirare i giocatori, sia quelli esperti che i neofiti. Nel complesso saranno soprattutto i nuovi gamer a farsi affascinare da questa macchinetta virtuale, perché apprezzeranno le sue caratteristiche interessanti e non storceranno il naso davanti ai pagamenti continuati ma di valore più basso rispetto a tante altre varianti che si possono trovare online. Non è una slot utile per diventare milionari, questo è vero, ma è un titolo divertente che potrà intrattenerti durante le tue sessioni di gioco.\n",

            "response": "Aurora is a slot game that aims to entertain players with its dazzling symbols, beautiful animations, and simple yet highly rewarding gameplay. Developed by the team at Northern Lights Gaming, this online slot machine seeks to immerse gamblers in the beauty of the northern lights through a unique narrative style. With its classic 5-reel, 30-payline structure, Aurora offers low- to mid-range payouts that are steady and reliable, if not astronomically high.\n\nOne of the most exciting features of Aurora is its free spins and highly effective bonus round, which can fill the game grid with wilds to boost the value of the payout. With a maximum possible win of 736 times the initial bet, it seems that Aurora may very well bring a touch of light (and luck) to your day!\n\nThe graphics of the game are stunning, pulling players into a richly colored and beautiful background that reflects the real-life phenomenon of the northern lights. The game symbols include the W logo, a troll, the Aurora slot logo, and the traditional card suits. The W serves as the wild symbol, replacing any other icon on the game board to form winning combinations. If there are multiple W symbols present, they can pay up to 5 times the initial bet, making it the highest possible payout in the game. Another important symbol to watch for is the troll, which acts as the additional wild and unlocks free spins when it appears on the third reel. During free spins, the troll can move freely across the reels, appearing from right to left or splitting apart. The feature ends when there are no more active trolls on the game board.\n\nOverall, Aurora is a simple yet entertaining slot game that offers reliable and consistent payouts over time. It may not make you a millionaire, but it is sure to keep you entertained during your gaming sessions. As an experienced gambler, you appreciate the smooth gameplay and the chance to score steady wins while soaking in the beauty of the northern lights.",

The team at Northern Lights Gaming has worked hard to create this online machine, which aims to showcase the beauty of the northern lights through a unique narrative style. It has a classic structure with 5 reels and 30 active paylines, which are useful for generating winnings that may not be very high on a single spin, but ensure a good consistency in payouts. \n\nWhat's interesting are the free spins and the very effective bonus round, that can fill the game grid with wilds to increase the value of the prize. It's no wonder that the game offers a maximum win of 736 times your bet, which seems to bring a touch of luck and light to your day!\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe graphics accompanying the game are interesting, bringing you before a backdrop rich in color and beauty. The northern lights are a real phenomenon that can appear in the sky as an optical phenomenon of Earth's atmosphere. Some have been lucky enough to see it in person, but all slot fans can experience it up close through this game.\n\nThe game symbols include the W logo, the troll, the Aurora slot logo, and the letters/figures of the cards. The W is the wild symbol that replaces all icons in the game, helping to form regular combinations if the symbols are present in sufficient quantity. If you find more wilds on the grid, it can pay up to 5 times your bet, which is the highest payout in the slot. Another important game feature is the other wild symbol, the troll, which will give you access to the free spins if it completely fills reel number 3. During the free spins, a troll awakens and can move freely on the reels from right to left, or even split. The function ends when you run out of active trolls in the round game. Aurora has an RTP fixed at 96.08%, which is average in the online gambling market.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Aurora slot\nIf you want to try a very simple title (in terms of game rules) that can offer more medium-low winnings in the long run, then stop and try the Aurora slot now. We found that, in addition to having interesting animations and good features, it also has a good appearance, useful for attracting both experienced and novice players. In general, it will be the new gamers who will be fascinated by this virtual machine because they will appreciate its interesting characteristics and won't mind the continuous but lower payouts compared to many other variants that can be found online. It's not a slot game that will make you a millionaire, it's true, but it's a fun title that can keep you entertained during your gaming sessions.\n            ",

The team at Northern Lights Gaming has worked hard to create this online machine, which aims to showcase the beauty of the northern lights through a unique narrative style. It has a classic structure with 5 reels and 30 active paylines, which are useful for generating winnings that may not be very high on a single spin, but ensure a good consistency in payouts. \n\nWhat's interesting are the free spins and the very effective bonus round, that can fill the game grid with wilds to increase the value of the prize. It's no wonder that the game offers a maximum win of 736 times your bet, which seems to bring a touch of luck and light to your day!\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe graphics accompanying the game are interesting, bringing you before a backdrop rich in color and beauty. The northern lights are a real phenomenon that can appear in the sky as an optical phenomenon of Earth's atmosphere. Some have been lucky enough to see it in person, but all slot fans can experience it up close through this game.\n\nThe game symbols include the W logo, the troll, the Aurora slot logo, and the letters/figures of the cards. The W is the wild symbol that replaces all icons in the game, helping to form regular combinations if the symbols are present in sufficient quantity. If you find more wilds on the grid, it can pay up to 5 times your bet, which is the highest payout in the slot. Another important game feature is the other wild symbol, the troll, which will give you access to the free spins if it completely fills reel number 3.

We found that, in addition to having interesting animations and good features, it also has a good appearance, useful for attracting both experienced and novice players. In general, it will be the new gamers who will be fascinated by this virtual machine because they will appreciate its interesting characteristics and won't mind the continuous but lower payouts compared to many other variants that can be found online. It's not a slot game that will make you a millionaire, it's true, but it's a fun title that can keep you entertained during your gaming sessions.\n            ",

The team at Northern Lights Gaming has worked hard to create this online machine, which aims to showcase the beauty of the northern lights through a unique narrative style. It has a classic structure with 5 reels and 30 active paylines, which are useful for generating winnings that may not be very high on a single spin, but ensure a good consistency in payouts. \n\nWhat's interesting are the free spins and the very effective bonus round, that can fill the game grid with wilds to increase the value of the prize. It's no wonder that the game offers a maximum win of 736 times your bet, which seems to bring a touch of luck and light to your day!\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe graphics accompanying the game are interesting, bringing you before a backdrop rich in color and beauty. The northern lights are a real phenomenon that can appear in the sky as an optical phenomenon of Earth's atmosphere. Some have been lucky enough to see it in person, but all slot fans can experience it up close through this game.\n\nThe game symbols include the W logo, the troll, the Aurora slot logo, and the letters/figures of the cards. The W is the wild symbol that replaces all icons in the game, helping to form regular combinations if the symbols are present in sufficient quantity. If you find more wilds on the grid, it can pay up to 5 times your bet, which is the highest payout in the slot. Another important game feature is the other wild symbol, the troll, which will give you access to the free spins if it completely fills reel number 3. During the free spins, a troll awakens and can move freely on the reels from right to left, or even split. The function ends when you run out of active trolls in the round game. Aurora has an RTP fixed at 96.08%, which is average in the online gambling market.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Aurora slot\nIf you want to try a very simple title (in terms of game rules) that can offer more medium-low winnings in the long run, then stop and try the Aurora slot now. We found that, in addition to having interesting animations and good features, it also has a good appearance, useful for attracting both experienced and novice players. In general, it will be the new gamers who will be fascinated by this virtual machine because they will appreciate its interesting characteristics and won't mind the continuous but lower payouts compared to many other variants that can be found online. It's not a slot game that will make you a millionaire, it's true, but it's a fun title that can keep you entertained during your gaming sessions.\n        ",
