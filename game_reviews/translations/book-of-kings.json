No! Few themes are as captivating, with high volatility and an RTP: the online slot machine Book of Kings was born from an idea by Rarestone Gaming (Playtech) that takes us to Ancient Egypt. Its title is a clear reference to other famous games that have found success in the online gambling sector and beyond. It has a standard structure of 5 reels and 10 pay lines and not only offers free bonuses but also the possibility to turn any random symbol into its new special icon. Amongst the sand, scorching heat and dunes, the game tells the story of an explorer who rewards us with rich rewards. In this review, we will discover the features of the game, the functions and the winning symbols that increase your winnings.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe slot is characterized by typical design for this type of adventure in Ancient Egypt: we have the mysterious pyramids in the background, which ensure a simple but visually pleasing graphics. Its soundtrack is well done and recalls a very pleasant traditional style while playing the game. Amongst the game symbols, we have the inevitable A, K, Q, J, and 10 that are paired with the Eye of Ra, the image of Tutankhamun, our explorer protagonist, and Horus (the falcon god). It is precisely these last symbols that are the luckiest, and just 2 on the game board are enough to form a winning combination. But the explorer is what reigns supreme, a beautiful and young woman with a highly rewarding power! If combinations with her image appear on 2, 3, 4, or 5 boxes, you will receive a prize equal to 1, 10, 50, or 500 times the total bet. The slot's wild symbols are 2: the book and the snake, which have the enormous power to replace all game symbols. The total value of 5 combinations allows you to reach 200x your bet. We have had the opportunity to try the slot not only from the computer but also from our smartphone and to our great surprise, found it engaging with the animations provided by the game. Especially because we did not detect any loss in graphic quality.\n\nFinal Considerations on the Book of Kings Slot\nBook of Kings is a product that wants to delve deeper into a theme already popular for slot machines. Ancient Egyptian symbols are a great certainty for worldwide software houses that seek to always offer new gaming solutions that attract gamblers. Maximum winnings can also reach up to 15,000 times your bet when you take advantage of the various bonuses and additional features. As the slot shows, tombs and pyramids not only still attract large online audiences but can also be the reason for excellent winnings. Its RTP is 96.5%, and the high volatility guarantees relatively high prizes with lower frequency than other games. Experienced gamblers will find the Book of Kings slot to be a great addition to their repertoire.\n            ",
