The background is the planet Mars with its desert landscape that can be seen behind the game grid. The colors of the symbols are bright, with a vibrant pink frame and a mustard yellow pattern. Rather than being just reproduced, the symbols appear to be drawn, just like in animated cartoons.\n\nMoney From Mars is full of animations, such as occasional appearances of a spaceship passing behind the grid or a robot taking a walk among the planet's craters. The game also features an upbeat tune that can be turned off at any time with the appropriate button.\n\nThe slot game has 50 paylines that spin on a grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. Bets are suitable for all pockets, with a minimum bet of €1 and a maximum of €50, which can be determined with a single click. Between 10 and 100 automatic spins can be set with no limits on winning or losing. To stop the Autoplay, simply click the same text again.\n\nWinning combinations are made by matching 3 to 5 identical symbols on a payline from left to right. The RTP value is not very high at 94.66%, while volatility is medium, striking a balance between the size of the winnings and the frequency of winning combinations.\n\nThe slot game is full of symbols that can be divided into low-level and high-level symbols and special symbols. Low-level symbols are represented by playing cards from 10 to Ace. 9, 10, and J pay just the bet, while Q, K, and Ace double it. The high-level symbols are the transmission tower, followed by the gun and the robot, and finally the alien couple. \n\nThere are also four special symbols. The UFO is the Wild symbol that replaces all other symbols except the special ones. The circle with the letter A and the disc with the blue prism are also Wild symbols. When they appear, the UFO flies across the grid and drops a x2 multiplier that doubles the payout.\n\nThe meteorite is the Scatter symbol and, besides being payable itself, awards free spins. The number of Free Spins depends on the symbols with the money and the question mark. It includes:\n\n10 Free Spins and a x5 multiplier.\n15 Free Spins but with a x3 multiplier.\n20 Free Spins but with a x2 multiplier.\n\nThe disc with the prism activates the Money Bags Feature. In this case, the purple bag is a Scatter symbol and awards three free spins. Each spin locks the bags onto the reels. At the end of the free spins, depending on the number of bags, we could win either one of two minor or major jackpots or a payout equal to 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 times the bet.\n\nThe Grand jackpot is won only when all 15 slots are full with bags.\n            ",

It has 50 paylines spinning on a 5x3 grid, with a medium volatility and an RTP of 94.66%. The game also features an upbeat tune that can be turned off at any time.\n\nPaylines and Bets\n\nBets range from €1 to €50 with a single click. The Autoplay feature allows for between 10 and 100 automatic spins. The Autoplay feature can be disabled by simply clicking the same text again.\n\nSymbols and Combinations\n\nThe slot game is full of colorful and animated symbols, including low-level and high-level paying symbols, and special symbols. Low-level symbols are represented by playing cards. High-level symbols are a transmission tower, a gun, a robot, and an alien couple. There are four special symbols, including the UFO Wild symbol, the blue prism Wild symbol, the letter A Wild symbol, and the meteorite Scatter symbol. Winning combinations are made by matching 3 to 5 identical symbols on a payline from left to right.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThere are multiple bonus features in Money From Mars, including multipliers and free spins. The blue prism and letter A Wild symbols have x2 multipliers; they unlock when the UFO flies across the grid and drops the multiplier onto the reels. The meteorite Scatter symbol pays out and awards free spins, depending on the symbols with the money and the question mark. Players can win between 10 to 20 free spins with a x2 to x5 multiplier. The purple bag Scatter symbol unlocks the Money Bags Feature, where players can win minor or major jackpots or a payout equal to 1 to 250 times the bet, depending on the number of bags on the reels.\n\nVisual Design\n\nMoney From Mars has an attractive and charming graphic design that is rich in animations. The background is the planet Mars with its desert landscape illuminated by a vibrant pink frame and a mustard yellow pattern. The symbols appear to be drawn, like in animated cartoons. The game is full of animations of a spaceship passing behind the grid and a robot taking a walk among the planet's craters.\n\n        \n            ",

There are three Wild symbols, and two of them trigger a UFO that flies across the grid and drops a x2 multiplier. There is also a Scatter symbol, a meteorite, which not only pays out but also awards free spins that come with multipliers ranging from x2 to x5.

The game is set against the background of the planet Mars, and there are many animations, such as a spaceship passing behind the grid or a robot walking around the planet's craters. The game features an upbeat tune that can be turned off at any time, with a vibrant pink frame and a mustard yellow pattern surrounding the symbols that look like they were drawn, as in animated cartoons.\n\nPaylines and Bets\n\nMoney From Mars has 50 paylines and a betting range suitable for all pockets, with a minimum bet of €1 and a maximum of €50.

High-level symbols are the transmission tower, followed by the gun and the robot, ending with the alien couple. There are also four special symbols, including three different Wild symbols and the meteorite Scatter symbol. The disc with the blue prism and the letter A is a Wild symbol, which activates the UFO's x2 multiplier.\n\n        \n            ",

Bets are suitable for all pockets, with a minimum bet of €1 and a maximum of €50, which can be determined with a single click. Between 10 and 100 automatic spins can be set with no limits on winning or losing. To stop the Autoplay, simply click the same text again.\n\nWinning combinations are made by matching 3 to 5 identical symbols on a payline from left to right. The RTP value is not very high at 94.66%, while volatility is medium, striking a balance between the size of the winnings and the frequency of winning combinations.\n\nThe slot game is full of symbols that can be divided into low-level and high-level symbols and special symbols.

The high-level symbols are the transmission tower, followed by the gun and the robot, and finally the alien couple. \n\nThere are also four special symbols. The UFO is the Wild symbol that replaces all other symbols except the special ones. The circle with the letter A and the disc with the blue prism are also Wild symbols. When they appear, the UFO flies across the grid and drops a x2 multiplier that doubles the payout.\n\nThe meteorite is the Scatter symbol and, besides being payable itself, awards free spins. The number of Free Spins depends on the symbols with the money and the question mark. It includes:\n\n10 Free Spins and a x5 multiplier.\n15 Free Spins but with a x3 multiplier.\n20 Free Spins but with a x2 multiplier.\n\nThe disc with the prism activates the Money Bags Feature.

The background is the planet Mars with its desert landscape that can be seen behind the game grid. The colors of the symbols are bright, with a vibrant pink frame and a mustard yellow pattern. Rather than being just reproduced, the symbols appear to be drawn, just like in animated cartoons.\n\nMoney From Mars is full of animations, such as occasional appearances of a spaceship passing behind the grid or a robot taking a walk among the planet's craters. The game also features an upbeat tune that can be turned off at any time with the appropriate button.\n\nThe slot game has 50 paylines that spin on a grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. Bets are suitable for all pockets, with a minimum bet of €1 and a maximum of €50, which can be determined with a single click. Between 10 and 100 automatic spins can be set with no limits on winning or losing. To stop the Autoplay, simply click the same text again.\n\nWinning combinations are made by matching 3 to 5 identical symbols on a payline from left to right. The RTP value is not very high at 94.66%, while volatility is medium, striking a balance between the size of the winnings and the frequency of winning combinations.\n\nThe slot game is full of symbols that can be divided into low-level and high-level symbols and special symbols. Low-level symbols are represented by playing cards from 10 to Ace. 9, 10, and J pay just the bet, while Q, K, and Ace double it. The high-level symbols are the transmission tower, followed by the gun and the robot, and finally the alien couple. \n\nThere are also four special symbols. The UFO is the Wild symbol that replaces all other symbols except the special ones. The circle with the letter A and the disc with the blue prism are also Wild symbols. When they appear, the UFO flies across the grid and drops a x2 multiplier that doubles the payout.\n\nThe meteorite is the Scatter symbol and, besides being payable itself, awards free spins. The number of Free Spins depends on the symbols with the money and the question mark. It includes:\n\n10 Free Spins and a x5 multiplier.\n15 Free Spins but with a x3 multiplier.\n20 Free Spins but with a x2 multiplier.\n\nThe disc with the prism activates the Money Bags Feature. In this case, the purple bag is a Scatter symbol and awards three free spins. Each spin locks the bags onto the reels. At the end of the free spins, depending on the number of bags, we could win either one of two minor or major jackpots or a payout equal to 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 times the bet.\n\nThe Grand jackpot is won only when all 15 slots are full with bags.\n        ",
