The theme of Lucky Little Devil is not exactly an innovative choice, but we like the way it has been treated. We find ourselves in the flames of Hell, but instead of being surrounded by scary demons and dark presences, we are guided in this game by a smiling little devil, with an air that is anything but bad!\nThe graphics aspect of Lucky Little Devil is nothing outstanding, lacking three-dimensional animations and with the only special effect being the slot's protagonist devil popping up to the left of the reels to give random multipliers. Nevertheless, we must still commend Red Tiger Gaming because it is a very entertaining and engaging slot machine that guarantees a more than satisfying gaming experience.\nYou can play Lucky Little Devil with real money or in demo version for training and discovering all the secrets of the slot without investing a single cent and without any need for registration.\nYou can enjoy this Red Tiger Gaming game on your computer and on all mobile devices, both iOS and Android, without losing anything in terms of functionality and resolution!\nKey features of the slot machine\nLucky Little Devil is a slot machine with a very traditional structure, with five reels, three rows, and 20 paylines.\nThe betting range is quite wide, starting from a minimum of only 20 cents up to a maximum of 60€, which caters to more or less all types of players.\nThis very cute slot has medium volatility, so you can have both constant but small wins, and you can also aspire to the maximum jackpot of up to 50,000 coins, not bad, right?\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) stands at a good 96.12%, nothing staggering but more or less in line with most slot games.\nSymbols and features of Lucky Little Devil\nOn the reels of Lucky Little Devil, we can find both thematic and non-thematic symbols: the non-thematic symbols are the so-called real ones, i.e., the numbers and letters related to playing cards, in this case from 10 to Ace, which among all symbols are the ones with the lowest value.\nAmong the thematic symbols, we have a trident, a trap that hides a diamond, a cauldron, and a coin with the number 666, which represents the highest value icon, paying up to 1,300 times the bet value.\nThe special features are called Lucky Spins, Little Help, Devil's Work, and Free Spins, and are activated when the special symbols appear, i.e., the coins and, of course, the little devil himself.\n            ",
