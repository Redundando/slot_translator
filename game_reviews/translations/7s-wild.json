            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"7s Wild\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\n7s Wild\n7s Wild is a simple slot game by Spielo with a fruit machine theme. Red sevens, colorful fruits, and golden bells spin on the screen with simple graphics and a backdrop of sparkling stars.\nThe icons are all retro-inspired, taking players back to old-school arcade games with their basic images and computerized sound effects. Players will appreciate the basic charm of this game while also keeping an eye out for free spins, bonus games, and wild symbols.\nNostalgic Graphics\n7s Wild is a very simple slot game with bright fruits that remind us of old-school arcade games, lucky sevens, and golden bells that add more retro touches. The paylines work both ways, making this a great idea to increase your winning chances without adding other special features. The seven flaming wild symbols and free spins give more ways to win and add more interest to the game.\nWhile high rollers will appreciate the wide range of bets and high maximum bet, low rollers may be disappointed to discover that there is a minimum bet of €5.00, which is quite high for a quick bet on a simple slot game. Overall, 7s Wild is an attractive slot but without enough features to entertain players looking for more action.\nSpielo's 7s Wild is a simple game that has some sparkling symbols and a starry background. The slot has 5 reels, 3 rows, and 5 paylines. The paylines are not fixed, and users can select them as they wish. It is a retro-inspired machine with basic graphics. It gives the feeling of reliving the old days of gaming when slot machines had 8-bit computer-generated music. As we have already mentioned, it uses a beautiful night background illuminated by stars.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nThe special symbols offered are balls, fruits, and lots of fiery red 7s. The sevens are the symbols that pay the most. The other symbols are a golden ball, plums, and oranges. The attractive features of the slot are the free spins as well as the Wilds. The game has omitted bonus spins, scatters, and a multiplier mechanism.\nExperienced players who play this slot machine will find winning very easy and have a wide range of betting values to risk. By adjusting the lines and the coin cuts, they can use a minimum bet of 5 coins and a maximum of 500 coins per line. The paylines form winning combinations from left to right. The game's theoretical RTP is 96.2%. Players do not have a huge jackpot to win in this gambling option, but winning symbols appear very frequently, and leaving as a winner is not difficult for players.\nSince the rules of this gambling option are simple, it is not possible to cheat in the game. Interested players have the chance to play the 7s Wild slot machine online before betting with real money. An important tip for gamblers is to bet with a small bet and to increase it slowly.\nWilds: As the name of the slot machine suggests, the flaming 7 is the wild of the game. It can replace any other symbol to trigger more wins.\nFree Spins: The burning symbol triggers free spins. If a player lands 5 red symbols on fire, they are awarded 5 free spins. The larger the number of red ones, the greater the number of free spins awarded.\nBig payouts: This retro game is not so retro when it comes to rewarding players with big wins. The 7s reward players with the highest amount. The player is awarded 1,000 coins if they hit 5 red sevens on an active payline. Then comes the golden ball, which pays up to 500 coins for 5 of these symbols. After these two, the next in line is the plum symbol. This rewards the player with 250 coins for 5 symbols that land on a game line. Oranges and cherries are less rewarding than the other three symbols. Oranges pay 150 coins, while 5 cherries pay only 10 coins.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you have chosen this slot produced by Spielo, it is because you are a bit nostalgic. In that case, we recommend betting your money on Mighty Hot Wilds, the traditional themed slot machine produced by Inspired that allows you to win big thanks to its high RTP.\n        ",

Red sevens, colorful fruits, and golden bells spin on the screen with simple graphics and a backdrop of sparkling stars.\nThe icons are all retro-inspired, taking players back to old-school arcade games with their basic images and computerized sound effects. Players will appreciate the basic charm of this game while also keeping an eye out for free spins, bonus games, and wild symbols.\nNostalgic Graphics\n7s Wild is a very simple slot game with bright fruits that remind us of old-school arcade games, lucky sevens, and golden bells that add more retro touches. The paylines work both ways, making this a great idea to increase your winning chances without adding other special features. The seven flaming wild symbols and free spins give more ways to win and add more interest to the game.\nWhile high rollers will appreciate the wide range of bets and high maximum bet, low rollers may be disappointed to discover that there is a minimum bet of €5.00, which is quite high for a quick bet on a simple slot game. Overall, 7s Wild is an attractive slot but without enough features to entertain players looking for more action.\nSpielo's 7s Wild is a simple game that has some sparkling symbols and a starry background. The slot has 5 reels, 3 rows, and 5 paylines. The paylines are not fixed, and users can select them as they wish. It is a retro-inspired machine with basic graphics. It gives the feeling of reliving the old days of gaming when slot machines had 8-bit computer-generated music. As we have already mentioned, it uses a beautiful night background illuminated by stars.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nThe special symbols offered are balls, fruits, and lots of fiery red 7s. The sevens are the symbols that pay the most. The other symbols are a golden ball, plums, and oranges. The attractive features of the slot are the free spins as well as the Wilds. The game has omitted bonus spins, scatters, and a multiplier mechanism.\nExperienced players who play this slot machine will find winning very easy and have a wide range of betting values to risk. By adjusting the lines and the coin cuts, they can use a minimum bet of 5 coins and a maximum of 500 coins per line. The paylines form winning combinations from left to right. The game's theoretical RTP is 96.2%. Players do not have a huge jackpot to win in this gambling option, but winning symbols appear very frequently, and leaving as a winner is not difficult for players.\nSince the rules of this gambling option are simple, it is not possible to cheat in the game. Interested players have the chance to play the 7s Wild slot machine online before betting with real money. An important tip for gamblers is to bet with a small bet and to increase it slowly.\nWilds: As the name of the slot machine suggests, the flaming 7 is the wild of the game. It can replace any other symbol to trigger more wins.\nFree Spins: The burning symbol triggers free spins. If a player lands 5 red symbols on fire, they are awarded 5 free spins. The larger the number of red ones, the greater the number of free spins awarded.\nBig payouts: This retro game is not so retro when it comes to rewarding players with big wins. The 7s reward players with the highest amount. The player is awarded 1,000 coins if they hit 5 red sevens on an active payline. Then comes the golden ball, which pays up to 500 coins for 5 of these symbols. After these two, the next in line is the plum symbol. This rewards the player with 250 coins for 5 symbols that land on a game line. Oranges and cherries are less rewarding than the other three symbols. Oranges pay 150 coins, while 5 cherries pay only 10 coins.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you have chosen this slot produced by Spielo, it is because you are a bit nostalgic. In that case, we recommend betting your money on Mighty Hot Wilds, the traditional themed slot machine produced by Inspired that allows you to win big thanks to its high RTP.\n            ",

The game is full of colorful and enticing symbols that can make your day with just one lucky spin.</p>\n             <p>But let's talk about the red sevens - these are the symbols that pay the most, and boy do they pay. How much you ask? How about 1,000 coins for landing 5 of them on an active payline! Just imagine all the things you can do with that kind of money - you could buy a whole pack of seven-layer burritos from Taco Bell.</p>\n             <p>And then there's the golden ball symbol, which also pays out a whopping 500 coins for landing 5 symbols on an active payline. It's not quite as tasty and delicious as the burritos, but 500 coins is still nothing to scoff at.</p>\n             <p>But wait, there's more! The plum symbol is also a great symbol to land, paying out 250 coins for landing 5 of them. Oranges are worth 150 coins, which could buy you a nice refreshing glass of OJ on a hot summer's day. And finally, the cherries may not be the highest paying symbol, but they still deliver a healthy payout of 10 coins for 5 symbols. That's enough to buy a nice bag of candy to snack on while you keep playing.</p>\n             <p>So what are you waiting for? Give 7s Wild a spin and see if you can land those big payouts. Who knows, maybe you'll even hit the jackpot and be able to buy your own Taco Bell franchise!</p>\"\n}"

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics and Features\n\n7s Wild by Spielo is a retro-inspired slot game with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 5 paylines. The paylines are not fixed, and users can select them as they wish. The game features symbols such as fruits, golden bells, and sevens. The sevens are the most valuable symbols, followed by the golden bell and plums. The flaming 7 is the wild symbol that can replace any other symbol to trigger more wins. The game features free spins that are triggered by landing 5 burning red symbols, and the more red symbols that land, the more free spins are awarded. While there is no bonus game or multiplier mechanism, experienced players will find the game enjoyable due to the high frequency of winning symbols appearing.\n\nGraphics and Sound Effects\n\n7s Wild has a nostalgic look with simple graphics that remind players of old-school arcade games. The symbols feature bright colors and are accompanied by computerized sound effects that take players back in time. The backdrop of the game is a starry night sky that adds to the retro feel of the game.\n\nPayouts for Landing Certain Symbol Combinations\n\n7s Wild rewards players with big payouts for landing certain symbol combinations. The red sevens pay the most with 1,000 coins for landing 5 of them on an active payline, followed by the golden ball that pays up to 500 coins for 5 symbols. The plum symbol rewards players with 250 coins for landing 5 symbols, while oranges pay 150 coins and cherries pay 10 coins for 5 symbols.\n\nMinimum and Maximum Bets\n\n7s Wild offers a wide range of betting values to risk, with a minimum bet of 5 coins and a maximum of 500 coins per line. However, the minimum bet may be high for some players who prefer to bet lower amounts on a simple game like this.\n\nTarget Audience\n\n7s Wild is a simple and retro-themed slot game that will appeal to players looking for a nostalgic gaming experience. High rollers may appreciate the wide range of bets and high maximum bet, while low rollers may find the minimum bet to be too high. Players looking for more action and bonus features may be disappointed with this game's simplicity.\n\nComparison to Similar Slot Games\n\nFor players who enjoy nostalgic-themed slot games like 7s Wild, we recommend Mighty Hot Wilds by Inspired, which features a traditional theme and high RTP. While it lacks some features and bonus games, 7s Wild offers high frequency of winning symbols, free spins, and a wild symbol that can trigger more wins.\n\n        \n            ",

The game features wild symbols and free spins, but no other special bonuses or multipliers. With 5 reels, 3 rows, and 5 adjustable paylines, players have a wide range of betting values to choose from.\n\nVisual and audio design of 7s Wild\n\n7s Wild has a retro-inspired design with computerized sound effects that take players back to older arcade games. The symbols include colorful fruits, lucky sevens, and golden bells, all set against a backdrop of sparkling stars. The graphics are basic but charming in their simplicity.\n\nWild and bonus symbols in 7s Wild\n\nThe flaming red seven symbol is the wild in 7s Wild, substituting for all other symbols except the scatter. The burning symbol triggers the free spins feature, with 5 red symbols awarding 5 free spins. There are no other bonus symbols or multipliers in this game.\n\nPayout opportunities in 7s Wild\n\nThe highest paying symbol in 7s Wild is the red sevens, rewarding players with 1,000 coins for hitting 5 symbols on an active payline. The golden ball pays up to 500 coins, while the plums pay 250 coins. Oranges and cherries are the lowest paying symbols, with oranges paying 150 coins and 5 cherries paying only 10 coins. The game has a theoretical RTP of 96.2%, and players can choose from a wide range of betting values.\n\nSuitability for high rollers vs low rollers\n\nWhile high rollers will appreciate the wide range of betting values and high maximum bet in 7s Wild, low rollers may be disappointed to discover that the minimum bet is €5.00, which is quite high for a simple slot game. Experienced players will find winning easy, but players looking for more action may want to look for a game with more features and bonuses.\n\nRecommendations for similar games to 7s Wild\n\nIf you enjoy the nostalgic charm of 7s Wild, we recommend trying Mighty Hot Wilds by Inspired. This traditional themed slot machine has a high RTP and offers players the chance to win big without complicated bonus features. Another option is Mega Joker by NetEnt, which features classic fruit symbols and a progressive jackpot.\n\n        \n            ",

Red sevens, colorful fruits, and golden bells spin on the screen with simple graphics and a backdrop of sparkling stars.\nThe icons are all retro-inspired, taking players back to old-school arcade games with their basic images and computerized sound effects. Players will appreciate the basic charm of this game while also keeping an eye out for free spins, bonus games, and wild symbols.\nNostalgic Graphics\n7s Wild is a very simple slot game with bright fruits that remind us of old-school arcade games, lucky sevens, and golden bells that add more retro touches. The paylines work both ways, making this a great idea to increase your winning chances without adding other special features. The seven flaming wild symbols and free spins give more ways to win and add more interest to the game.\nWhile high rollers will appreciate the wide range of bets and high maximum bet, low rollers may be disappointed to discover that there is a minimum bet of €5.00, which is quite high for a quick bet on a simple slot game. Overall, 7s Wild is an attractive slot but without enough features to entertain players looking for more action.\nSpielo's 7s Wild is a simple game that has some sparkling symbols and a starry background. The slot has 5 reels, 3 rows, and 5 paylines. The paylines are not fixed, and users can select them as they wish. It is a retro-inspired machine with basic graphics. It gives the feeling of reliving the old days of gaming when slot machines had 8-bit computer-generated music. As we have already mentioned, it uses a beautiful night background illuminated by stars.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nThe special symbols offered are balls, fruits, and lots of fiery red 7s. The sevens are the symbols that pay the most. The other symbols are a golden ball, plums, and oranges. The attractive features of the slot are the free spins as well as the Wilds. The game has omitted bonus spins, scatters, and a multiplier mechanism.\nExperienced players who play this slot machine will find winning very easy and have a wide range of betting values to risk. By adjusting the lines and the coin cuts, they can use a minimum bet of 5 coins and a maximum of 500 coins per line. The paylines form winning combinations from left to right. The game's theoretical RTP is 96.2%. Players do not have a huge jackpot to win in this gambling option, but winning symbols appear very frequently, and leaving as a winner is not difficult for players.\nSince the rules of this gambling option are simple, it is not possible to cheat in the game. Interested players have the chance to play the 7s Wild slot machine online before betting with real money. An important tip for gamblers is to bet with a small bet and to increase it slowly.\nWilds: As the name of the slot machine suggests, the flaming 7 is the wild of the game. It can replace any other symbol to trigger more wins.\nFree Spins: The burning symbol triggers free spins. If a player lands 5 red symbols on fire, they are awarded 5 free spins. The larger the number of red ones, the greater the number of free spins awarded.\nBig payouts: This retro game is not so retro when it comes to rewarding players with big wins. The 7s reward players with the highest amount. The player is awarded 1,000 coins if they hit 5 red sevens on an active payline. Then comes the golden ball, which pays up to 500 coins for 5 of these symbols. After these two, the next in line is the plum symbol. This rewards the player with 250 coins for 5 symbols that land on a game line. Oranges and cherries are less rewarding than the other three symbols. Oranges pay 150 coins, while 5 cherries pay only 10 coins.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you have chosen this slot produced by Spielo, it is because you are a bit nostalgic. In that case, we recommend betting your money on Mighty Hot Wilds, the traditional themed slot machine produced by Inspired that allows you to win big thanks to its high RTP.\n            ",

The seven flaming wild symbols and free spins give more ways to win and add more interest to the game.\nWhile high rollers will appreciate the wide range of bets and high maximum bet, low rollers may be disappointed to discover that there is a minimum bet of €5.00, which is quite high for a quick bet on a simple slot game. Overall, 7s Wild is an attractive slot but without enough features to entertain players looking for more action.\nSpielo's 7s Wild is a simple game that has some sparkling symbols and a starry background. The slot has 5 reels, 3 rows, and 5 paylines. The paylines are not fixed, and users can select them as they wish. It is a retro-inspired machine with basic graphics. It gives the feeling of reliving the old days of gaming when slot machines had 8-bit computer-generated music. As we have already mentioned, it uses a beautiful night background illuminated by stars.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nThe special symbols offered are balls, fruits, and lots of fiery red 7s. The sevens are the symbols that pay the most. The other symbols are a golden ball, plums, and oranges. The attractive features of the slot are the free spins as well as the Wilds. The game has omitted bonus spins, scatters, and a multiplier mechanism.\nExperienced players who play this slot machine will find winning very easy and have a wide range of betting values to risk. By adjusting the lines and the coin cuts, they can use a minimum bet of 5 coins and a maximum of 500 coins per line. The paylines form winning combinations from left to right. The game's theoretical RTP is 96.2%. Players do not have a huge jackpot to win in this gambling option, but winning symbols appear very frequently, and leaving as a winner is not difficult for players.\nSince the rules of this gambling option are simple, it is not possible to cheat in the game. Interested players have the chance to play the 7s Wild slot machine online before betting with real money. An important tip for gamblers is to bet with a small bet and to increase it slowly.\nWilds: As the name of the slot machine suggests, the flaming 7 is the wild of the game. It can replace any other symbol to trigger more wins.\nFree Spins: The burning symbol triggers free spins. If a player lands 5 red symbols on fire, they are awarded 5 free spins. The larger the number of red ones, the greater the number of free spins awarded.\nBig payouts: This retro game is not so retro when it comes to rewarding players with big wins. The 7s reward players with the highest amount. The player is awarded 1,000 coins if they hit 5 red sevens on an active payline. Then comes the golden ball, which pays up to 500 coins for 5 of these symbols. After these two, the next in line is the plum symbol. This rewards the player with 250 coins for 5 symbols that land on a game line. Oranges and cherries are less rewarding than the other three symbols. Oranges pay 150 coins, while 5 cherries pay only 10 coins.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you have chosen this slot produced by Spielo, it is because you are a bit nostalgic. In that case, we recommend betting your money on Mighty Hot Wilds, the traditional themed slot machine produced by Inspired that allows you to win big thanks to its high RTP.\n            ",
