Il pagamento dal Wild è lo stesso del trifoglio a 4 foglie d’oro (15 x puntata per 3).\nI simboli a tema sono un quadrifoglio dorato, un ferro di cavallo, un boccale di birra spumeggiante, la scarpa del folletto e il suo cappello a cilindro.

Questo moltiplicatore wild viene moltiplicato per il moltiplicatore di vittoria con cui si gioca nella funzione Rainbow Spins.\nIl modificatore Rainbow Lines è particolarmente utile in quanto si può giocare con 9 linee di vincita rispetto alle 5 standard. Il modificatore più significativo è il Moltiplicatore di Vittoria Extra, poiché il moltiplicatore può salire molto in alto.\nSi può giocare al gioco di ispirazione irlandese a partire da soli 0,05€ a giro – per i giocatori con tasche più profonde, si può giocare con fino a 100€ a giro. Con una modalità a velocità fulminea disponibile, c’è una funzione Autoplay in cui si sceglie tra 10 e 1.000 giri.\nPotete fermarla quando una singola vittoria supera un importo a vostra scelta, se il vostro equilibrio è inferiore ad un certo importo o se è superiore ad un certo importo.

Starting at just €0.05 per spin across all devices, this lucky Irish-themed game boasts an expanding wild that increases the multiplier with every spin. The Rainbow Spins feature lets you choose between coins to add extra paylines, win more free spins, and increase the multiplier.\n\nWith an Irish countryside backdrop and a rainbow above, Gaelic Gold transports you on a virtual visit to the emerald isle. This Nolimit City adventure entices players with wild leprechauns and Rainbow Spins. The game has 3 reels, 3 rows, and 5 fixed paylines. The orderly golden frame surrounds the reels and is decorated with four-leaf clovers that show the paylines. Fields, rivers, and a blue sky rainbow complete the cheerful scene.\n\nSymbols include royal cards A, K, Q, and J – as well as leprechaun hats and shoes, pints of stout, lucky golden horseshoes, and golden four-leaf clovers. The latter pays 15 times your bet for 3 in combination. The leprechaun is the wild symbol and replaces all the standard symbols to help form winning combinations. The payout from the wild is the same as the golden four-leaf clover (15 x bet for 3).\n\nThe theme symbols consist of a golden clover, a horseshoe, a frothy beer tankard, leprechaun’s shoes and top hat. The leprechaun himself is the Wild, appearing in three positions at the top of the reels and will substitute for all standard symbols to help form winning combos. The pot of gold is the bonus symbol.\n\nGaelic Gold benefits from an xNudge Wild symbol (a fully expanded leprechaun). This 3-row high wild symbol can appear on reels 1, 2, and 3 and always nudges to fill the entire reel.\n\nEach nudge triggers the xNudge Wild feature and increases the multiplier by 1. It is possible to land multiple wild multipliers simultaneously with the wild multiplier combining for a big multiplier.\n\nThe other important symbol is the Pot of Gold Bonus symbol. When it appears in the central position on reel 2 (the middle reel), the Rainbow Spins feature is activated. You'll receive a minimum of 5 free spins.\n\nBefore the free spins commence, it is possible to add further modifiers by choosing from the 9 coins. You are guaranteed to pick up at least 1 coin. These include: Extra spins – up to 25 free spins can be added per coin; Rainbow lines – these are 2 additional rainbow lines per coin; Extra win multiplier – gives you a win multiplier increase up to 5x per coin.\n\nIf an xNudge Wild is landed during the feature, the multiplier will increase. This wild multiplier is multiplied by the win multiplier you are playing with in the Rainbow Spins feature.\n\nThe Rainbow Lines modifier is particularly useful as you can play with 9 paylines instead of the standard 5. The most significant modifier is the Extra Win Multiplier, as the multiplier can soar very high.\n\nYou can play this Irish-inspired game starting at just €0.05 per spin – for players with deeper pockets, you can play with up to €100 per spin. With a lightning fast mode available, there is an Autoplay feature where you choose between 10 and 1,000 spins.\n\nYou can stop it when a single win exceeds a chosen amount, if your balance is less than a certain amount, or if it's greater than a certain amount. This allows you to gamble responsibly if necessary.\n\nMedium-high variance (8/10 according to Nolimit City), the RTP is 96.15%, which is fair for an online slot. The maximum payout is 9,837 x your bet, with most wins coming in the base game. The biggest wins will come from the Rainbow Spins feature, but it will take an average of 127 spins to trigger it.\n\nSimilar slot games include Rainbow Riches Megaways by Barcrest. This version has 6 reels and up to 117,649 ways to win for even bigger wins. Get ready for the luck of the Irish to shine upon you with Gaelic Gold!\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame Overview\n\nGaelic Gold by Nolimit City is a 3-reel, 3-row slot game with an Irish countryside backdrop and a rainbow above. Symbols include royal cards A, K, Q, and J, as well as leprechaun hats and shoes, pints of stout, lucky golden horseshoes, and golden four-leaf clovers. The leprechaun is the wild symbol that replaces all standard symbols. The game features an xNudge Wild symbol that increases the multiplier with every spin.\n\nRainbow Spins Feature\n\nThe Rainbow Spins feature is activated when the Pot of Gold Bonus symbol lands in the central position on reel 2. Players will receive a minimum of 5 free spins and can choose modifiers from 9 different coins to add extra paylines, win more free spins, and increase the multiplier. The xNudge Wild feature can also be triggered, which increases the multiplier by 1 with each nudge.\n\nBase Game Wins\n\nMost wins in Gaelic Gold come in the base game. The golden four-leaf clover pays out 15 times your bet for three in combination. The leprechaun wild symbol pays out the same amount.

Starting at just €0.05 per spin across all devices, this lucky Irish-themed game boasts an expanding wild that increases the multiplier with every spin. The Rainbow Spins feature lets you choose between coins to add extra paylines, win more free spins, and increase the multiplier.\n\nWith an Irish countryside backdrop and a rainbow above, Gaelic Gold transports you on a virtual visit to the emerald isle. This Nolimit City adventure entices players with wild leprechauns and Rainbow Spins. The game has 3 reels, 3 rows, and 5 fixed paylines. The orderly golden frame surrounds the reels and is decorated with four-leaf clovers that show the paylines. Fields, rivers, and a blue sky rainbow complete the cheerful scene.\n\nSymbols include royal cards A, K, Q, and J – as well as leprechaun hats and shoes, pints of stout, lucky golden horseshoes, and golden four-leaf clovers. The latter pays 15 times your bet for 3 in combination. The leprechaun is the wild symbol and replaces all the standard symbols to help form winning combinations. The payout from the wild is the same as the golden four-leaf clover (15 x bet for 3).\n\nThe theme symbols consist of a golden clover, a horseshoe, a frothy beer tankard, leprechaun’s shoes and top hat. The leprechaun himself is the Wild, appearing in three positions at the top of the reels and will substitute for all standard symbols to help form winning combos. The pot of gold is the bonus symbol.\n\nGaelic Gold benefits from an xNudge Wild symbol (a fully expanded leprechaun). This 3-row high wild symbol can appear on reels 1, 2, and 3 and always nudges to fill the entire reel.\n\nEach nudge triggers the xNudge Wild feature and increases the multiplier by 1. It is possible to land multiple wild multipliers simultaneously with the wild multiplier combining for a big multiplier.\n\nThe other important symbol is the Pot of Gold Bonus symbol. When it appears in the central position on reel 2 (the middle reel), the Rainbow Spins feature is activated. You'll receive a minimum of 5 free spins.\n\nBefore the free spins commence, it is possible to add further modifiers by choosing from the 9 coins. You are guaranteed to pick up at least 1 coin. These include: Extra spins – up to 25 free spins can be added per coin; Rainbow lines – these are 2 additional rainbow lines per coin; Extra win multiplier – gives you a win multiplier increase up to 5x per coin.\n\nIf an xNudge Wild is landed during the feature, the multiplier will increase. This wild multiplier is multiplied by the win multiplier you are playing with in the Rainbow Spins feature.\n\nThe Rainbow Lines modifier is particularly useful as you can play with 9 paylines instead of the standard 5. The most significant modifier is the Extra Win Multiplier, as the multiplier can soar very high.\n\nYou can play this Irish-inspired game starting at just €0.05 per spin – for players with deeper pockets, you can play with up to €100 per spin. With a lightning fast mode available, there is an Autoplay feature where you choose between 10 and 1,000 spins.\n\nYou can stop it when a single win exceeds a chosen amount, if your balance is less than a certain amount, or if it's greater than a certain amount. This allows you to gamble responsibly if necessary.\n\nMedium-high variance (8/10 according to Nolimit City), the RTP is 96.15%, which is fair for an online slot. The maximum payout is 9,837 x your bet, with most wins coming in the base game. The biggest wins will come from the Rainbow Spins feature, but it will take an average of 127 spins to trigger it.\n\nSimilar slot games include Rainbow Riches Megaways by Barcrest. This version has 6 reels and up to 117,649 ways to win for even bigger wins. Get ready for the luck of the Irish to shine upon you with Gaelic Gold!\n            ",

The payout from the wild is the same as the golden four-leaf clover (15 x bet for 3).\n\nThe theme symbols consist of a golden clover, a horseshoe, a frothy beer tankard, leprechaun’s shoes and top hat. The leprechaun himself is the Wild, appearing in three positions at the top of the reels and will substitute for all standard symbols to help form winning combos. The pot of gold is the bonus symbol.\n\nGaelic Gold benefits from an xNudge Wild symbol (a fully expanded leprechaun). This 3-row high wild symbol can appear on reels 1, 2, and 3 and always nudges to fill the entire reel.\n\nEach nudge triggers the xNudge Wild feature and increases the multiplier by 1. It is possible to land multiple wild multipliers simultaneously with the wild multiplier combining for a big multiplier.\n\nThe other important symbol is the Pot of Gold Bonus symbol. When it appears in the central position on reel 2 (the middle reel), the Rainbow Spins feature is activated. You'll receive a minimum of 5 free spins.\n\nBefore the free spins commence, it is possible to add further modifiers by choosing from the 9 coins. You are guaranteed to pick up at least 1 coin. These include: Extra spins – up to 25 free spins can be added per coin; Rainbow lines – these are 2 additional rainbow lines per coin; Extra win multiplier – gives you a win multiplier increase up to 5x per coin.\n\nIf an xNudge Wild is landed during the feature, the multiplier will increase. This wild multiplier is multiplied by the win multiplier you are playing with in the Rainbow Spins feature.\n\nThe Rainbow Lines modifier is particularly useful as you can play with 9 paylines instead of the standard 5. The most significant modifier is the Extra Win Multiplier, as the multiplier can soar very high.\n\nYou can play this Irish-inspired game starting at just €0.05 per spin – for players with deeper pockets, you can play with up to €100 per spin. With a lightning fast mode available, there is an Autoplay feature where you choose between 10 and 1,000 spins.\n\nYou can stop it when a single win exceeds a chosen amount, if your balance is less than a certain amount, or if it's greater than a certain amount. This allows you to gamble responsibly if necessary.\n\nMedium-high variance (8/10 according to Nolimit City), the RTP is 96.15%, which is fair for an online slot. The maximum payout is 9,837 x your bet, with most wins coming in the base game. The biggest wins will come from the Rainbow Spins feature, but it will take an average of 127 spins to trigger it.\n\nSimilar slot games include Rainbow Riches Megaways by Barcrest. This version has 6 reels and up to 117,649 ways to win for even bigger wins. Get ready for the luck of the Irish to shine upon you with Gaelic Gold!\n            ",
