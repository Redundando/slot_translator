We have seen it countless times in the world of entertainment, both in books and films, as well as in cartoons, such as Disney's Sword in the Stone, or in TV series, like Merlin. Indeed, it is undeniable that medieval stories of magic and sorcery, destiny and war, are extremely fascinating. Play'n Go seizes the opportunity and tries to immerse its players in a magical and mysterious world, inspired by the stories of Merlin, with Lord Merlin and the Lady of the Lake.\n\nThe Magical Lake of Lord Merlin and the Lady of the Lake\nAs easily inferred from the title, Lord Merlin and the Lady of the Lake transports us to a hidden lake in the midst of a dense and mysterious forest. The background of the slot machine is undoubtedly very scenic and fascinating, and its charisma is only amplified by the exceptional soundtrack. The sound effects are also of great impact, making us imagine that the forest in the background is capable of moving. Not surprisingly, both the frame of the grid (very classic, 5 reels of 3 rows each), and the simpler symbols, are decorated as if they were made of enchanted wood intertwined with itself. Among the other symbols we find a coat of arms, a scepter, Merlin, and a wizard's hat. The Lady of the Lake is the Wild symbol, while the sword in the stone (available in two variants, one with a golden aura and one with a green aura) serves as the scatter symbol. Play'n Go has always accustomed us to simple slot machines, but extremely well-cared for in graphics and music, and Lord Merlin and the Lady of the Lake is no exception. Here too, all symbols are accompanied by pleasant animations.\n\nMultiply Your Symbols with Lord Merlin and the Lady of the Lake\nJust like the other Play'n Go slot machines, Lord Merlin and the Lady of the Lake is rather simple and straightforward in terms of gameplay. However, it nevertheless hides some features that give it its own identity and specific value. The only special function is that of free spins, which has two variants. When you get 3 or more scatter symbols, the player is entitled to 8 free spins. During these spins, a random special symbol is chosen among those. If the symbol appears on the first reel, it will expand across the entire grid, leading to a big win. If other scatter symbols appear during the free spins, the player is entitled to Excalibur Spin, which can be multiplied every time 2 more scatter symbols are obtained. The multiplication function is also present in Excalibur Spin. Lord Merlin and the Lady of the Lake has an RTP of 96.2%, therefore perfectly average, and has high volatility. If you have enjoyed Lord Merlin and the Lady of the Lake and are looking for similar slots, then our advice is to try all Play'n Go slot machines. If you are passionate about Merlin and King Arthur, we recommend Merlin's Moneyburst and King Arthur.",

We have seen it countless times in the entertainment world, both in books and films, but also in cartoons, just think of Disney's Sword in the Stone, or in TV series like Merlin. It is undeniable that medieval tales of magic and sorcery, destiny and war, are extremely fascinating.\n\nPlay'n Go does not miss the opportunity and tries to immerse its players in a magical and mysterious world, inspired by the stories of Merlin, with Lord Merlin And The Lady Of The Lake.\n\nThe Magical Lake Of Lord Merlin And The Lady Of The Lake\n\nAs easily inferred from the title, Lord Merlin And The Lady Of The Lake takes us to a lake hidden in the middle of a dense and mysterious forest. The background of the slot machine is certainly very scenic and fascinating, and its charisma is only amplified by the exceptional soundtrack. The sound effects are also of great impact, making us imagine that the forest in the background is capable of moving. \n\nNot surprisingly, both the frame of the grid (very classic, 5 reels with 3 rows each), and the simplest symbols, are decorated as if they were made of enchanted wood intertwined with itself. Among the other symbols, we find a coat of arms, a scepter, Merlin, and a wizard's hat. The Lady of the Lake is the Wild symbol, while the sword in the stone (available in two variants, one with a golden aura and one with a green aura) acts as a scatter symbol.\n\nPlay'n Go has always offered simple slot machines, but extremely well-crafted in graphics and music, and Lord Merlin And The Lady Of The Lake is no exception. Even here, all the symbols are accompanied by pleasant animations.\n\nMultiply Your Symbols with Lord Merlin And The Lady Of The Lake\n\nJust like the other Play'n Go slot machines, Lord Merlin And The Lady Of The Lake proves to be quite simple and straightforward from a gameplay point of view. Nevertheless, it still hides some features that give it its own identity and specific value.\n\nThe only special feature is the free spins, which however has two variations. When you get 3 or more scatter symbols, the player is entitled to 8 free spins. During these spins, a special symbol is randomly chosen from among those available. If the symbol appears on the first reel, it will expand throughout the grid, thus leading to a big win.\n\nIf other scatter symbols appear during free spins, the player is entitled to Excalibur Spins, which can be multiplied every time 2 additional scatter symbols are obtained. The multiplication feature is also present in Excalibur Spins.\n\nLord Merlin And The Lady Of The Lake has an RTP of 96.2%, perfectly average, and has high volatility.\n\nSimilar Slots to Lord Merlin And The Lady Of The Lake\n\nIf you enjoyed Lord Merlin And The Lady Of The Lake and are looking for similar slots, then the advice we can give you is to try all the Play'n Go slot machines. If you are passionate about Merlin and King Arthur, we recommend Merlin's Moneyburst and King Arthur.\n        ",
