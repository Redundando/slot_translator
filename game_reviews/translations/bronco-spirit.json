La schermata iniziale si apre con Spirit, maestoso cavallo ritratto su uno sfondo desertico con montagne spoglie, avvoltoi e piante di cactus in primo piano. Il colore dominate è l’arancione del sole che tramonta. La schermata di gioco offre lo stesso sfondo: sulla destra c’è il protagonista della slot e al centro la cornice in cui si trovano i rulli. In basso si trovano i tasti per il settaggio, inclusi quelli per tenere d’occhio alcuni particolari importanti, come ad esempio l’importo della scommessa. Sulla sinistra, il tasto “i” ci permette di accedere alla tabella dei pagamenti in cui è indicato il valore dei singoli simboli e delle varie combinazioni. Sempre in basso c’è il tasto per regolare il volume della musica e quello Autoplay che fa andare il gioco in modalità automatica. Bronco Spirit è una slot intuitiva e di facile utilizzo, consigliata anche a chi non ha dimestichezza con i giochi di slot.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot\nQuesta slot di casa Pragmatic Play ha uno schema classico: cinque rulli per quattro righe con 75 linee di pagamento fisse. Con una volatilità medio alta si possono ottenere vincite sostanziose anche se ci vorrà un po’ di pazienza perché potrebbero non essere così frequenti. Un punto di forza di questa slot è senz’altro l’RTP del 96,51%, superiore rispetto alla media che si attesta intorno al 96%. La puntata varia da un minimo di venticinque centesimi fino a un massimo di 125 € per giro.\nBronco Spirit esiste sia in versione desktop che mobile, funzionante sia su dispositivi IOS sia su quelli Android.

Una volta terminati i giri, le monete vengono ripartite tra i rulli, offrendo ulteriori ottime possibilità di vincita.\n",

The initial screen opens with Spirit, a majestic horse portrayed against a desert background with barren mountains, vultures and cactus plants in the foreground. The dominant color is the orange of the setting sun. The game screen offers the same background: on the right is the protagonist of the slot and in the center is the frame where the reels are located. At the bottom are the buttons for setting, including those to keep an eye on important details such as the amount of the bet. On the left, the \"i\" button allows us to access the paytable where the value of the individual symbols and various combinations are indicated. Always at the bottom, there is the button to adjust the volume of the music and the Autoplay button that makes the game go into automatic mode. Bronco Spirit is an intuitive and easy-to-use slot, recommended even for those who are not familiar with slot games.\n\nMain features of the slot\n\nThis slot from Pragmatic Play has a classic scheme: five reels by four rows with 75 fixed paylines. With a medium to high volatility, substantial winnings can be obtained, although it may take some patience as they may not be so frequent. One strength of this slot is certainly the RTP of 96.51%, higher than the average that stands around 96%. The bet ranges from a minimum of twenty-five cents up to a maximum of €125 per spin.\n\nBronco Spirit exists in both desktop and mobile versions, working on both IOS and Android devices. It is not necessary to download and no login is required, nor is there any sending of personal data, fully respecting the player's privacy.\n\nSymbols and functions of Bronco Spirit\n\nIn addition to the thematic symbols related to Native Americans such as the ax, campfire, pipe, drum, horse, and gold coin, we have those that are not thematic, represented by playing cards.\n\nAmong the special symbols, the gold coin depicting the horse is the Wild which acts as a joker.\n\nThe Bonus symbol, which acts as a Scatter, is represented by the sunset and allows you to activate a variable number of free spins: if three appear on the reels, you are entitled to a number of free spins ranging from 5 to 15; if you have four, the free spins range from 10 to 30 and if five bonus symbols appear, the free spins range from 15 to 45.\n\nBronco Spirit also offers a progressive feature: by purchasing 10 spins, all the mustangs (the golden coins) are collected in a special box visible on the right-hand side of the screen, up to a maximum of twenty. Once the spins are over, the coins are redistributed among the reels, offering further excellent opportunities to win.\n            ",

The initial screen opens with Spirit, a majestic horse portrayed against a desert background with barren mountains, vultures and cactus plants in the foreground. The dominant color is the orange of the setting sun. The game screen offers the same background: on the right is the protagonist of the slot and in the center is the frame where the reels are located. At the bottom are the buttons for setting, including those to keep an eye on important details such as the amount of the bet. On the left, the \"i\" button allows us to access the paytable where the value of the individual symbols and various combinations are indicated. Always at the bottom, there is the button to adjust the volume of the music and the Autoplay button that makes the game go into automatic mode. Bronco Spirit is an intuitive and easy-to-use slot, recommended even for those who are not familiar with slot games.\n\nMain features of the slot\n\nThis slot from Pragmatic Play has a classic scheme: five reels by four rows with 75 fixed paylines. With a medium to high volatility, substantial winnings can be obtained, although it may take some patience as they may not be so frequent. One strength of this slot is certainly the RTP of 96.51%, higher than the average that stands around 96%. The bet ranges from a minimum of twenty-five cents up to a maximum of €125 per spin.\n\nBronco Spirit exists in both desktop and mobile versions, working on both IOS and Android devices. It is not necessary to download and no login is required, nor is there any sending of personal data, fully respecting the player's privacy.\n\nSymbols and functions of Bronco Spirit\n\nIn addition to the thematic symbols related to Native Americans such as the ax, campfire, pipe, drum, horse, and gold coin, we have those that are not thematic, represented by playing cards.\n\nAmong the special symbols, the gold coin depicting the horse is the Wild which acts as a joker.\n\nThe Bonus symbol, which acts as a Scatter, is represented by the sunset and allows you to activate a variable number of free spins: if three appear on the reels, you are entitled to a number of free spins ranging from 5 to 15; if you have four, the free spins range from 10 to 30 and if five bonus symbols appear, the free spins range from 15 to 45.\n\nBronco Spirit also offers a progressive feature: by purchasing 10 spins, all the mustangs (the golden coins) are collected in a special box visible on the right-hand side of the screen, up to a maximum of twenty. Once the spins are over, the coins are redistributed among the reels, offering further excellent opportunities to win.\n            ",

The initial screen opens with Spirit, a majestic horse portrayed against a desert background with barren mountains, vultures and cactus plants in the foreground. The dominant color is the orange of the setting sun. The game screen offers the same background: on the right is the protagonist of the slot and in the center is the frame where the reels are located. At the bottom are the buttons for setting, including those to keep an eye on important details such as the amount of the bet. On the left, the \"i\" button allows us to access the paytable where the value of the individual symbols and various combinations are indicated. Always at the bottom, there is the button to adjust the volume of the music and the Autoplay button that makes the game go into automatic mode. Bronco Spirit is an intuitive and easy-to-use slot, recommended even for those who are not familiar with slot games.\n\nMain features of the slot\n\nThis slot from Pragmatic Play has a classic scheme: five reels by four rows with 75 fixed paylines. With a medium to high volatility, substantial winnings can be obtained, although it may take some patience as they may not be so frequent. One strength of this slot is certainly the RTP of 96.51%, higher than the average that stands around 96%. The bet ranges from a minimum of twenty-five cents up to a maximum of €125 per spin.\n\nBronco Spirit exists in both desktop and mobile versions, working on both IOS and Android devices. It is not necessary to download and no login is required, nor is there any sending of personal data, fully respecting the player's privacy.\n\nSymbols and functions of Bronco Spirit\n\nIn addition to the thematic symbols related to Native Americans such as the ax, campfire, pipe, drum, horse, and gold coin, we have those that are not thematic, represented by playing cards.\n\nAmong the special symbols, the gold coin depicting the horse is the Wild which acts as a joker.\n\nThe Bonus symbol, which acts as a Scatter, is represented by the sunset and allows you to activate a variable number of free spins: if three appear on the reels, you are entitled to a number of free spins ranging from 5 to 15; if you have four, the free spins range from 10 to 30 and if five bonus symbols appear, the free spins range from 15 to 45.\n\nBronco Spirit also offers a progressive feature: by purchasing 10 spins, all the mustangs (the golden coins) are collected in a special box visible on the right-hand side of the screen, up to a maximum of twenty. Once the spins are over, the coins are redistributed among the reels, offering further excellent opportunities to win.\n            ",
