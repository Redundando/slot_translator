It is not surprising, as the Inca, Maya, and Aztecs have always been part of the collective imagination for the charm exerted by their cultures and the search for gold by the conquerors in search of El Dorado.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising to see this theme applied to one or more slots from the same producer, such as Capecod, and the birth of slots like Mayan Temple Revenge.\nLet's quickly see what this slot has to offer.\n\nMayan Temple Revenge: visual aspect\nFrom a purely graphic point of view, the slot tries to combine the historical style with symbols that refer to the place of belonging of the theme to a more modern style made of colors and light. We find symbols related to Mayan totems and temples, but also neon lights and playing card symbols (A, K, Q...) in colorful shades. Although this combination, on paper, may not seem the best, in reality, the slot proves to be pleasant to play.\nOne caveat: the sound department. In between spins, we are accompanied by background percussion that makes the game captivating. The problem arises during the spins themselves when the volume of these drums becomes decidedly louder, so it is advisable to lower the device's audio before starting to play.\n\nMayan Temple Revenge: gameplay mechanics\nLet's move on to the technical aspect of this slot: as usual, we are faced with a title that exploits the common mechanism of 5*3, like most online slots by Capecod (although in this case, it is a collaboration with Elsy).\nThe RTP, that is, the return to player, is slightly above 94%, less than the 95% average of this producer. The RTP, in case the reader is not familiar with what we are talking about, is the percentage of money emitted in the form of winnings compared to those issued in the form of bets. An RTP of 94% means that for every €100 played (on average), €94 are released in the form of winnings.\nMoving on to the symbols that can be found on the game grid, the King is the one with the highest value, to which symbols with a special function must be added. As in other Capecod titles, we are also talking about two Wild symbols in this case: the Joker is simply a wild card that can replace any other symbol on the game screen, while the Wild expands across the whole game column, so it can be considered as three Jokers stacked on top of each other.\nIn addition, there are two special symbols (Scatter) that give access to the game's bonus mode, all functions that allow for an interesting number of wins despite the slightly below average RTP.\n\nSlots similar to Mayan Temple Revenge\nThe Mayan people have always inhabited the world of online slots. We can talk about different related titles, such as Mayan Riches by IGT, Diego Fortune by Booongo, or even Temple Quest by Microgaming.\n            ",

There are also two special Scatter symbols that lead to the game's bonus mode.

The theme is popular among game producers, and Capecod collaborated with Elsy to bring their version of this theme to life.\n\nDesign and Symbols\n\nThe slot’s graphics combine the historical style with modern symbols that represent the charm of ancient Mayan culture. Players can find symbols related to Mayan totems and temples, neon lights, playing cards, among others. While this combination may not seem ideal, the slot proves to be a pleasant visual experience. The slot has sound effects, but the volume of the drums during spins might be overwhelming.\n\nWild and Scatter symbols\n\nMayan Temple Revenge includes a wide variety of symbols players can expect to find in an online slot game. The game includes two wild symbols: the Joker, a wildcard that can replace any symbol on the game screen, and the Wild Card, which expands across the whole game column, much like three Jokers stacked on top of each other. In addition, there are two special symbols, Scatters, that give access to the game's bonus mode.\n\nRTP and Winning opportunities\n\nMayan Temple Revenge is a 5*3 online slot game that has an RTP of slightly above 94%, which is less than the average RTP for Capecod. This means that for every €100 played, €94 are released in the form of winnings. Despite its RTP, the game offers different functions that allow for an interesting number of wins. The King symbol is that with the highest value.\n\nComparison with other similar themed slot games\n\nMayan Temple Revenge is not the first game to explore pre-Columbian populations, and various titles have similar themes, such as Mayan Riches by IGT, Diego Fortune by Booongo, and Temple Quest by Microgaming. However, Mayan Temple Revenge stands out in its interesting winning features, such as its Wild and Scatter symbols.\n\n        \n            ",

It is not surprising, as the Inca, Maya, and Aztecs have always been part of the collective imagination for the charm exerted by their cultures and the search for gold by the conquerors in search of El Dorado.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising to see this theme applied to one or more slots from the same producer, such as Capecod, and the birth of slots like Mayan Temple Revenge.\nLet's quickly see what this slot has to offer.\n\nMayan Temple Revenge: visual aspect\nFrom a purely graphic point of view, the slot tries to combine the historical style with symbols that refer to the place of belonging of the theme to a more modern style made of colors and light. We find symbols related to Mayan totems and temples, but also neon lights and playing card symbols (A, K, Q...) in colorful shades. Although this combination, on paper, may not seem the best, in reality, the slot proves to be pleasant to play.\nOne caveat: the sound department. In between spins, we are accompanied by background percussion that makes the game captivating. The problem arises during the spins themselves when the volume of these drums becomes decidedly louder, so it is advisable to lower the device's audio before starting to play.\n\nMayan Temple Revenge: gameplay mechanics\nLet's move on to the technical aspect of this slot: as usual, we are faced with a title that exploits the common mechanism of 5*3, like most online slots by Capecod (although in this case, it is a collaboration with Elsy).\nThe RTP, that is, the return to player, is slightly above 94%, less than the 95% average of this producer. The RTP, in case the reader is not familiar with what we are talking about, is the percentage of money emitted in the form of winnings compared to those issued in the form of bets. An RTP of 94% means that for every €100 played (on average), €94 are released in the form of winnings.\nMoving on to the symbols that can be found on the game grid, the King is the one with the highest value, to which symbols with a special function must be added. As in other Capecod titles, we are also talking about two Wild symbols in this case: the Joker is simply a wild card that can replace any other symbol on the game screen, while the Wild expands across the whole game column, so it can be considered as three Jokers stacked on top of each other.\nIn addition, there are two special symbols (Scatter) that give access to the game's bonus mode, all functions that allow for an interesting number of wins despite the slightly below average RTP.\n\nSlots similar to Mayan Temple Revenge\nThe Mayan people have always inhabited the world of online slots. We can talk about different related titles, such as Mayan Riches by IGT, Diego Fortune by Booongo, or even Temple Quest by Microgaming.\n            ",

                            "content": "Create a cartoon-style feature image for Mayan Temple Revenge, featuring a happy Maya warrior with glasses. The image should be eye-catching, colorful and convey the theme and fun nature of the game. The warrior should be featured in the foreground, with the Mayan temple and totem symbols in the background. Use vibrant colors and make sure the warrior's glasses stand out. Add some neon lights to give the image a modern pop, and include the game's logo somewhere in the image to tie it all together. Overall the image should make players feel excited and ready to play the game."
