A medium or standard volatility features a balance between the frequency of winnings and the size of the sums won. In the case of high volatility, we will win less often, but the amounts are always of a high level. \n\nSymbols and Features\nThe low-value symbols are the playing cards from Jack to Ace. Following these, we find the acorn and the chestnut, the raspberry, and the strawberry.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay mechanics\nSymbols and Wilds\nBonus features\nBetting range and options\nGraphics and design\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Clover Lady \nThe protagonist of Clover Lady is the friendship between a girl and a wolf who live in a magical forest. The fairy tale theme is well represented by the graphics, with colorful lights flickering among the trees and the game grid in the shape of a mushroom. On the right side of the screen we find the wolf, and at the bottom are the selectable bets. \n\nThe control panel consists of the Start and Autoplay buttons. There is also the Turbo button: in normal mode there is the symbol of a turtle, while in fast mode there is that of a wolf. Another very clever button in our opinion is the one for volatility. \n\nFrom the menu you can select different options, such as full screen mode or energy saving mode. The sound comprises Celtic music and forest sounds. In addition, numerous visual animations related to winnings are also present. \n\nSlot Features\nWazdan decided to use a 6-reel, 3-row grid with 10 fixed paylines. To win, you need to match three identical symbols on an active line from the leftmost reel to the right. The betting range varies from 0.10€ to 100€, and you can choose between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins. The RTP value is 96%, while the volatility is selectable by clicking the corresponding button. We can choose low, medium, and high volatility. In the first case, we will win often but never astronomical figures. A medium or standard volatility features a balance between the frequency of winnings and the size of the sums won. In the case of high volatility, we will win less often, but the amounts are always of a high level. \n\nSymbols and Features\nThe low-value symbols are the playing cards from Jack to Ace. Following these, we find the acorn and the chestnut, the raspberry, and the strawberry. The clover is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Metalwolf and the girl. \n\nThe Metalwolf multiplies winnings by 1.5x, while the girl is our Bonus symbol. If it appears three times, then the special function will be activated. The grid empties, and we will be assigned three Respins. The only symbols allowed during the Bonus are the Metalwolf and the girl. Bonus symbols that appear on the left and right reels move to the central ones, while Metalwolf symbols can only appear on the top and bottom rows. Each time one of these symbols appears, Respins restart from three. \n\nAt the end of the free spins, winnings will be paid based on bonus symbols remaining on the screen, which are associated with the jackpots found on the upper part of the grid:\n\n3 Bonus symbols pay the Mini Jackpot\n4 Bonus symbols pay the Minor Jackpot\n5 Bonus symbols pay the Major Jackpot \n6 Bonus symbols pay the Grand Jackpot \n\nAdditionally, the prize will be multiplied by the number of Metalwolf symbols present on the reels. Each of these symbols multiplies winnings by 0.5. With 12 Metalwolf symbols the maximum multiplier is 7x. If 6 Bonus symbols are added to these, then the win reaches the maximum of 3,500x the bet!\n            ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame Overview\nGameplay Mechanics\nSymbols and Multipliers\nBonus Features\nConclusion\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Clover Lady \nThe protagonist of Clover Lady is the friendship between a girl and a wolf who live in a magical forest. The fairy tale theme is well represented by the graphics, with colorful lights flickering among the trees and the game grid in the shape of a mushroom. On the right side of the screen we find the wolf, and at the bottom are the selectable bets. \n\nThe control panel consists of the Start and Autoplay buttons. There is also the Turbo button: in normal mode there is the symbol of a turtle, while in fast mode there is that of a wolf. Another very clever button in our opinion is the one for volatility. \n\nFrom the menu you can select different options, such as full screen mode or energy saving mode. The sound comprises Celtic music and forest sounds. In addition, numerous visual animations related to winnings are also present. \n\nSlot Features\nWazdan decided to use a 6-reel, 3-row grid with 10 fixed paylines. To win, you need to match three identical symbols on an active line from the leftmost reel to the right. The betting range varies from 0.10€ to 100€, and you can choose between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins. The RTP value is 96%, while the volatility is selectable by clicking the corresponding button. We can choose low, medium, and high volatility. In the first case, we will win often but never astronomical figures. A medium or standard volatility features a balance between the frequency of winnings and the size of the sums won. In the case of high volatility, we will win less often, but the amounts are always of a high level. \n\nSymbols and Features\nThe low-value symbols are the playing cards from Jack to Ace. Following these, we find the acorn and the chestnut, the raspberry, and the strawberry. The clover is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Metalwolf and the girl. \n\nThe Metalwolf multiplies winnings by 1.5x, while the girl is our Bonus symbol. If it appears three times, then the special function will be activated. The grid empties, and we will be assigned three Respins. The only symbols allowed during the Bonus are the Metalwolf and the girl. Bonus symbols that appear on the left and right reels move to the central ones, while Metalwolf symbols can only appear on the top and bottom rows. Each time one of these symbols appears, Respins restart from three. \n\nAt the end of the free spins, winnings will be paid based on bonus symbols remaining on the screen, which are associated with the jackpots found on the upper part of the grid:\n\n3 Bonus symbols pay the Mini Jackpot\n4 Bonus symbols pay the Minor Jackpot\n5 Bonus symbols pay the Major Jackpot \n6 Bonus symbols pay the Grand Jackpot \n\nAdditionally, the prize will be multiplied by the number of Metalwolf symbols present on the reels. Each of these symbols multiplies winnings by 0.5. With 12 Metalwolf symbols the maximum multiplier is 7x. If 6 Bonus symbols are added to these, then the win reaches the maximum of 3,500x the bet!\n            ",

To win, you need to match three identical symbols on an active line from the leftmost reel to the right. The betting range varies from 0.10€ to 100€, and you can choose between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins. The RTP value is 96%, while the volatility is selectable by clicking the corresponding button. We can choose low, medium, and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and Wilds\n\nThe low-value symbols are the playing cards from Jack to Ace. Following these, we find the acorn and the chestnut, the raspberry, and the strawberry. The clover is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Metalwolf and the girl. The Metalwolf multiplies winnings by 1.5x, while the girl is our Bonus symbol. Bonus symbols that appear on the left and right reels move to the central ones, while Metalwolf symbols can only appear on the top and bottom rows.\n\nBonus features\n\nIf the girl symbol appears three times, the special function will be activated. The grid empties, and we will be assigned three Respins. The only symbols allowed during the Bonus are the Metalwolf and the girl. Each time one of these symbols appears, Respins restart from three. At the end of the free spins, winnings will be paid based on bonus symbols remaining on the screen, which are associated with the different jackpots found on the upper part of the grid: 3 Bonus symbols pay the Mini Jackpot, 4 Bonus symbols pay the Minor Jackpot, 5 Bonus symbols pay the Major Jackpot and 6 Bonus symbols pay the Grand Jackpot. Additionally, the prize will be multiplied by the number of Metalwolf symbols present on the reels.\n\nBetting range and options\n\nThe betting range in Clover Lady varies from 0.10€ to 100€ and you can choose between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins. Players may also enjoy various options such as Turbospin and different volatilities that they can select manually.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nThe visuals and sounds in Clover Lady really offer an immersive experience in a magical forest. The graphics are vibrant, with colorful lights flickering among the trees while the game grid is in the shape of a mushroom. The background Celtic music and forest sounds create an atmosphere of calm, while the various visual animations related to winnings make the gameplay interactive.\n\n        \n            ",

The game has a fairy tale theme that is well represented by its colorful graphics, which include lights flickering among trees and a game grid in the shape of a mushroom. The game symbols, animations, and sounds are all related to its enchanting theme.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\n\nClover Lady is played on a 6-reel, 3-row grid with 10 fixed paylines. To win, players need to match three identical symbols on an active payline from the leftmost reel to the right.

Players can select their preferred level by clicking the corresponding button. The game's RTP value is 96%.\n\nSymbols and Multipliers\n\nThe game features both low-value and high-value symbols. The low-value symbols are the playing cards from Jack to Ace, while the high-value symbols include the acorn, chestnut, raspberry, strawberry, and clover. The clover is the Wild symbol and can replace all other symbols except for the Metalwolf and the girl. The Metalwolf symbol multiplies winnings by 1.5x, while the girl is the Bonus symbol that triggers the game's special feature. The number of Bonus symbols that appear on the grid determines the Jackpot value, which ranges from Mini to Grand. Each Metalwolf symbol on the reels multiplies winnings by 0.5, and the game offers a maximum multiplier of 7x.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe game's Bonus feature is triggered when the girl symbol appears three times on the reels.

The fairy tale theme is well represented by the graphics, with colorful lights flickering among the trees and the game grid in the shape of a mushroom. On the right side of the screen we find the wolf, and at the bottom are the selectable bets. \n\nThe control panel consists of the Start and Autoplay buttons. There is also the Turbo button: in normal mode there is the symbol of a turtle, while in fast mode there is that of a wolf. Another very clever button in our opinion is the one for volatility. \n\nFrom the menu you can select different options, such as full screen mode or energy saving mode. The sound comprises Celtic music and forest sounds. In addition, numerous visual animations related to winnings are also present. \n\nSlot Features\nWazdan decided to use a 6-reel, 3-row grid with 10 fixed paylines. To win, you need to match three identical symbols on an active line from the leftmost reel to the right. The betting range varies from 0.10€ to 100€, and you can choose between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins. The RTP value is 96%, while the volatility is selectable by clicking the corresponding button. We can choose low, medium, and high volatility. In the first case, we will win often but never astronomical figures. A medium or standard volatility features a balance between the frequency of winnings and the size of the sums won. In the case of high volatility, we will win less often, but the amounts are always of a high level. \n\nSymbols and Features\nThe low-value symbols are the playing cards from Jack to Ace. Following these, we find the acorn and the chestnut, the raspberry, and the strawberry. The clover is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Metalwolf and the girl. \n\nThe Metalwolf multiplies winnings by 1.5x, while the girl is our Bonus symbol. If it appears three times, then the special function will be activated. The grid empties, and we will be assigned three Respins. The only symbols allowed during the Bonus are the Metalwolf and the girl. Bonus symbols that appear on the left and right reels move to the central ones, while Metalwolf symbols can only appear on the top and bottom rows. Each time one of these symbols appears, Respins restart from three. \n\nAt the end of the free spins, winnings will be paid based on bonus symbols remaining on the screen, which are associated with the jackpots found on the upper part of the grid:\n\n3 Bonus symbols pay the Mini Jackpot\n4 Bonus symbols pay the Minor Jackpot\n5 Bonus symbols pay the Major Jackpot \n6 Bonus symbols pay the Grand Jackpot \n\nAdditionally, the prize will be multiplied by the number of Metalwolf symbols present on the reels. Each of these symbols multiplies winnings by 0.5. With 12 Metalwolf symbols the maximum multiplier is 7x. If 6 Bonus symbols are added to these, then the win reaches the maximum of 3,500x the bet!\n            ",
