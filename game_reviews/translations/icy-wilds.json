The betting range is large, with a minimum bet of 50 cents and a maximum bet of €1,000, indicating high volatility. The theoretical RTP of 96.15% is in line with industry standards and satisfying.\n\nGraphics\n\nIcy Wilds boasts outstanding graphics that will captivate players from the moment the game loads. The game's theme is inspired by Disney's Frozen, and the graphics feature a snowy forest illuminated by the polar aurora borealis, with pastel shades of pink and blue colors running throughout the game's design. The sound effects perfectly complement the graphics offering an immersive gaming experience.\n\nWinning Symbols\n\nIcy Wilds offers a plethora of non-themed symbols such as playing cards from J to K. The three primary but relatively low paying symbols are snow creatures - ermine, owl, and lynx, paying up to 100 times the bet. The jewels serve as the higher paying symbols and are followed by the ice princess, which offers up to 500 times the bet as the symbol with the highest payout. The Wild symbol is the corresponding word, replacing all other symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is represented as the Polar Bear and can give up to 45 free spins.\n\nBetting Range\n\nIcy Wilds has a betting range that is not for the faint of heart. The minimum bet is 50 cents, and the maximum bet is €1,000, indicating high volatility. The game promises the potential for significant wins but does not offer small, frequent payouts.\n\nScatter Symbol\n\nThe Polar Bear is Icy Wilds' Scatter symbol, and it can give up to 45 free spins. Players need to land at least three Scatter symbols on the game's reels to get free spins. The Scatter increases the chances of winning, and the free spins help to make up for the high volatility of the game.\n\n        \n            ",

The game is themed around an ice princess and several animals that accompany her in a snowy forest setting, with outstanding graphics and a theme tune played on ice instruments that add an extra layer of immersion to the game. \n\nGraphics and Sound Effects\n\nThe graphics are stunning, with the polar aurora borealis playing a leading role in the background of the game and lighting up a sort of snowy forest. The predominant colors are pastel shades of blue and pink, and everything shines in the sparkling ice. The visual artwork is top-notch. A perfectly curated soundtrack plays its lovely tune in perfect synergy with the icy theme to further enhance the gaming environment.\n\nBetting Range and RTP\n\nDespite being a simple and enjoyable game, Icy Wilds offers a betting range that may surprise even experienced players. While affordable at the lowest end with a minimum bet around 50 cents, the maximum bet is around €1,000, suggesting high volatility. Although small, the game's 96.15% RTP is satisfactory and falls within the average range when compared to other online slots.\n\nSymbol Payouts and Winning Combinations\n\nWinning payouts in Icy Wilds rely on a combination of three or more matching symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel.

We have hundreds of games set in the shadow of pyramids, Egypt served in all its variations, as well as Chinese-themed slots and those that exploit ancient civilizations of the past, not to mention the timeless fruit machines.\n\nIn all this, \"Icy Wilds\", a new slot in the IGT catalog, appears as a breath of fresh air, in every sense!\n\nThe inspiration for this game is clearly taken from Disney's \"Frozen\" cartoon: the characters are in fact an ice princess and several animals that keep her company, with a huge white bear that closely resembles Iorek, the protagonist of Pullman's \"His Dark Materials\".\n\nThe graphics are outstanding, with the polar aurora borealis playing a leading role in the background of the game and lighting up a sort of snowy forest. The predominant colors are pastel shades of blue and pink, and everything shines in the sparkling ice. To enrich the gaming experience, there is a perfectly themed soundtrack that sounds like it is played on ice instruments.\n\nGameplay of Icy Wilds\n\nPlaying this IGT slot machine is very simple: the smooth gameplay makes it a perfect game even for those who are new to the world of slots. However, the betting range is not for the faint of heart: while the minimum bet has a normal value of 50 cents, the maximum bet is truly mind-boggling, reaching up to €1,000! Such a high bet suggests high volatility, and that's exactly the case with Icy Wilds. It does not promise small and frequent wins, but it may surprise you with really interesting prizes.\n\nAs for the theoretical return to player (RTP), the Icy Wilds slot from IGT does not disappoint, boasting a decent 96.15%, which is in line with the majority of online slot games and fully satisfactory from this perspective.\n\nRegular and special symbols of Icy Wilds\n\nTo win on Icy Wilds, you must get a lineup of at least three identical symbols on adjacent reels starting from left to right. The non-themed symbols are represented by numbers and letters referring to playing cards, from J to K. Among the thematic symbols, the least profitable are the three snow creatures - ermine, owl, and lynx - which pay up to 100 times the value of the bet. Following these are the jewels and finally the princess, who offers wins up to 500 times the bet. There is a Wild symbol, simply represented by the corresponding word, while the Polar Bear is the Scatter of the game that can give up to 45 free spins!\n            ",

The image should be eye-catching and incorporate the icy and wintry themes of the game. The warrior should be positioned in the foreground of the image, with a snowy forest and aurora borealis in the background. The use of cool colors, such as light blues and purples, would be appropriate for this image. The warrior should be shown holding a large diamond or jewel to represent the high-value symbols of the game. Make sure to add some fun details, such as snowflakes or icicles, to enhance the overall icy theme of the image."
