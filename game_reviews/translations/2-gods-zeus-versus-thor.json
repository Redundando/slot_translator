Playable in BIG REEL Portrait Mode, the RTP is 96.5%, and the maximum win is an impressive 15,360x on every free spin.\n\nReleased through the Yggdrasil Gaming YGS Masters program, 2 Gods Zeus versus Thor plays on a 5-reel, 2048-ways to win grid split into two zones. The left side is dominated by the god of thunder Zeus, while the right is the realm of Thor, the God of Thunder. The graphics and animations are appropriately serious in tone, depicting the grandeur of these mythological legends.\n\nCombining Greek and Norse mythology, 2 Gods Zeus versus Thor presents a final battle between the gods Zeus and Thor. The graphics and animations are epic, creating a vivid portrayal of these legendary creatures. There are two sets of symbols - the red symbols from Greek mythology and the blue symbols from Norse mythology - each with variations of A, K, and Q royals, helmets, boats, dogs, and goddesses. The goddess symbols are the most valuable, giving players 0.2, 1.5, 3, or 7x stake for 2, 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\n\nThere are also two wild symbols, the red Zeus wild symbol and the blue Thor wild symbol, each replacing all red or blue symbols except the scatter and paying 0.3, 3, 7, or 10x stakes for 2, 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\n\nThe standout feature of the game is the two spin buttons, one red and one blue. Players are free to choose between them on every spin, doubling their payout if the color of the winning match corresponds to their chosen spin color. This effectively doubles the number of paylines, with 1,024 ways to win for red symbols from the leftmost reel and 1,024 ways to win for blue symbols from the rightmost reel.\n\nPlayable for as little as 10 cents and up to 20 euros per spin, players can choose to activate the Autoplay function and play automatically for a set number of spins, with single win and loss limits at their discretion. With an RTP of 96.5%, 60.3% of wins occur in the base game, and 36.2% in the Win Spins feature.\n\nHighly volatile, with a hit frequency of 25%, the game offers significant payouts, with the maximum win of 15,360x total bet per spin attainable through the Win Spins feature. The game also boasts three bonus features - the exclusive Dual Spin feature, Win Spins feature offering unlimited free spins with an increasing win multiplier, and a Win Spins multiplier feature that increases the multiplier before the win is paid out.\n\nIn summary, 2 Gods Zeus versus Thor is an exciting and dynamic slot game with immersive graphics and animations, innovative and rewarding features, and the potential for significant payouts.

Unlike most online slot games where you get a fixed number of free spins, the Win Spins feature in 2 Gods Zeus versus Thor offers you an unlimited number of free spins. Yes, you read that right - unlimited! And, as you keep spinning, the multiplier also keeps increasing, starting at 1x and going up by one with every spin you make.</p>\n\n  <p>But it doesn't end there. The Win Spins feature also offers a special Win Spins multiplier, where the multiplier value goes up before the win is paid out. This means that you can get an even higher payout than you would during the base game.</p>\n\n  <p>And that's not all - you can also re-trigger the feature, and the maximum win you can get is an impressive 15,360x total bet per spin. Now, that's what I call a win-win situation!</p>\n}\"\n}\n\n"

Featuring an innovative and new Dual Spin mechanism, players can choose between two spin buttons, doubling their winnings on each spin if the color of the winning match corresponds to their chosen spin color. The game also comes with a Win Spins feature with an increasing multiplier. Playable in BIG REEL Portrait Mode, the RTP is 96.5%, and the maximum win is an impressive 15,360x on every free spin.\n\nReleased through the Yggdrasil Gaming YGS Masters program, 2 Gods Zeus versus Thor plays on a 5-reel, 2048-ways to win grid split into two zones. The left side is dominated by the god of thunder Zeus, while the right is the realm of Thor, the God of Thunder. The graphics and animations are appropriately serious in tone, depicting the grandeur of these mythological legends.\n\nCombining Greek and Norse mythology, 2 Gods Zeus versus Thor presents a final battle between the gods Zeus and Thor. The graphics and animations are epic, creating a vivid portrayal of these legendary creatures. There are two sets of symbols - the red symbols from Greek mythology and the blue symbols from Norse mythology - each with variations of A, K, and Q royals, helmets, boats, dogs, and goddesses. The goddess symbols are the most valuable, giving players 0.2, 1.5, 3, or 7x stake for 2, 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\n\nThere are also two wild symbols, the red Zeus wild symbol and the blue Thor wild symbol, each replacing all red or blue symbols except the scatter and paying 0.3, 3, 7, or 10x stakes for 2, 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\n\nThe standout feature of the game is the two spin buttons, one red and one blue. Players are free to choose between them on every spin, doubling their payout if the color of the winning match corresponds to their chosen spin color. This effectively doubles the number of paylines, with 1,024 ways to win for red symbols from the leftmost reel and 1,024 ways to win for blue symbols from the rightmost reel.\n\nPlayable for as little as 10 cents and up to 20 euros per spin, players can choose to activate the Autoplay function and play automatically for a set number of spins, with single win and loss limits at their discretion. With an RTP of 96.5%, 60.3% of wins occur in the base game, and 36.2% in the Win Spins feature.\n\nHighly volatile, with a hit frequency of 25%, the game offers significant payouts, with the maximum win of 15,360x total bet per spin attainable through the Win Spins feature. The game also boasts three bonus features - the exclusive Dual Spin feature, Win Spins feature offering unlimited free spins with an increasing win multiplier, and a Win Spins multiplier feature that increases the multiplier before the win is paid out.\n\nIn summary, 2 Gods Zeus versus Thor is an exciting and dynamic slot game with immersive graphics and animations, innovative and rewarding features, and the potential for significant payouts. For similar experiences, players can try 6 Wild Sharks, another 4ThePlayer game with customizable gameplay and a Free Spins feature.\n            ",
