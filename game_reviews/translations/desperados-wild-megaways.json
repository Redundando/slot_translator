    "original_text": "\nDesperados Wild Megaways\nAmbientata nel selvaggio West, Desperados Wild Megaways prodotta dalla Inspired Gaming è una slot che appartiene alla famiglia delle Megaways, dove le linee di pagamento non sono fisse ma variano in base al numero dei simboli che si presentano sui rulli. Dal punto di vista grafico questa slot riprende tutti i simboli del West: cowboy dalla mano calda, whiskey, dinamite per gli attacchi alle diligenze e l’immancabile distintivo dello sceriffo a garantire l’ordine della città. Lo sfondo è il Gran Canyon, su cui si staglia la griglia dalla cornice di legno. Il comparto musicale ha un sapore epico, che si ispira a quello dei grandi Western che in passato hanno fatto la fortuna del Cinema.\nI tasti “Start”, “Impostazioni”, “Valore Scommessa” e “Acquisto Bonus” svaniscono durante la rotazione dei rulli e riappiano una volta concluso lo Spin.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia di gioco ha 6 rulli, mentre il numero delle linee dipende dalle dimensioni dei simboli: quelli più piccoli occupano 6 slot, quelli più grandi soltanto 2. Nella parte alta della cornice e in corrispondenza dei rulli 2, 3, 4 e 5 c’è una linea aggiuntiva. Come detto in precedenza i modi per vincere sono ben 117.649, con RTP pari al 95,21% e una volatilità media. La puntata va da un minimo di 0,20 a un massimo di 20 €. Tenendo premuto il tasto Start si possono attivare tra i 5 e 100 giri automatici, con la possibilità di impostare dei limiti di vincita o di perdita.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Desperados Wild Megaways\nPartiamo subito dicendo che ogni volta che si ha una combinazione pagante, i simboli vincenti scompaiono e vengono sostituiti. Per quel che riguarda il loro valore, come da copione le carte da gioco sono quelli che pagano meno di tutti, seguiti dalla bottiglia di whiskey, dalle pistole e dalla dinamite. Il simbolo con maggior valore è il distintivo dello sceriffo. I fuorilegge sono i 4 simboli Wild, hanno funzione di Jolly e sostituiscono tutti i simboli eccetto quello Bonus. Durante le partite normali, i simboli Wild possono apparire solo sulla linea extra. Per accedere ai livelli speciali del gioco è necessario che sui rulli appaiono 4 o più simboli Scatter, rappresentato dalla scritta Bonus. A questo punto il giocatore dovrà scegliere tra due livelli, Tramonto e Prigione. Vediamoli nel dettaglio:\n\nTramonto: con 4 simboli Scatter si hanno 8 giri gratuiti. Durante la partita speciale, i simboli Bonus possono apparire solo sul rullo superiore. Ognuno di esso garantisce un nuovo Free Spin, con 3 simboli invece avremo diritto a 5 giri aggiuntivi. Ogni combinazione vincente aggiunge un moltiplicatore x1.\nPrigione: in questo caso scompare il rullo extra in favore di una griglia 6×6. Anche la funzionalità Cascata viene interrotta. I simboli Wild che appaiono sui rulli rimangono durante tutti i Free Spins e nel caso si riesca a riempire con essi l’intera griglia, si avrà diritto a 5 giri extra.\n\nIl giocatore può anche decidere di acquistare i Bonus. Dopo aver scelto quale livello giocare, Tramonto o Prigione, si ha la possibilità di decidere se provare a incrementare il numero di Free Spins o di perdere l’intero Bonus.\n",

From a visual point of view, this slot game features all the symbols of the West: hot-handed cowboys, whiskey, dynamite for attacking stagecoaches, and the inevitable sheriff's badge to ensure order in the town. The background is the Grand Canyon, on which the wooden framed grid stands out. The sound department has an epic flair, inspired by the great Westerns that have made cinema successful in the past.\n\nThe \"Start,\" \"Settings,\" \"Bet Value,\" and \"Bonus Purchase\" buttons disappear during the rotation of the reels and reappear once the spin is completed.\n\nSlot features\nThe game grid has 6 reels, while the number of lines depends on the size of the symbols: smaller ones occupy 6 slots, larger ones only 2. In the upper part of the frame and corresponding to reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, there is an additional line. As previously mentioned, there are 117,649 ways to win, with an RTP of 95.21% and medium volatility. The bet ranges from a minimum of 0.20 to a maximum of 20 €. By holding down the Start button, between 5 and 100 automatic spins can be activated, with the possibility of setting win or loss limits.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Desperados Wild Megaways\nLet's start by saying that every time there is a winning combination, the winning symbols disappear and are replaced. As far as their value is concerned, as usual, the playing cards pay the least of all, followed by the whiskey bottle, guns, and dynamite. The symbol with the highest value is the sheriff's badge. The outlaws are the 4 Wild symbols, they have a Jolly function and replace all the symbols except the Bonus one. During normal games, Wild symbols can only appear on the extra line. To access the special levels of the game, it is necessary to have 4 or more Scatter symbols on the reels, represented by the word \"Bonus.\" At this point, the player must choose between two levels, Sunset and Prison. Let's see them in detail:\n\nSunset: with 4 Scatter symbols, you get 8 free spins. During the special game, Bonus symbols can only appear on the upper reel. Each of them guarantees a new Free Spin, with 3 symbols we are entitled to 5 additional spins. Each winning combination adds a multiplier x1.\nPrison: in this case, the extra reel disappears in favor of a 6x6 grid. The Cascade functionality is also interrupted. The Wild symbols that appear on the reels remain during all Free Spins, and if you manage to fill the entire grid with them, you are entitled to 5 extra spins.\n\nThe player can also decide to purchase the Bonus. After choosing which level to play, Sunset or Prison, you have the possibility to decide whether to try to increase the number of Free Spins or lose the entire Bonus. \n\nExperience the thrill of the Wild West and try out Desperados Wild Megaways slot today!\n            ",

From a visual point of view, this slot game features all the symbols of the West: hot-handed cowboys, whiskey, dynamite for attacking stagecoaches, and the inevitable sheriff's badge to ensure order in the town. The background is the Grand Canyon, on which the wooden framed grid stands out. The sound department has an epic flair, inspired by the great Westerns that have made cinema successful in the past.\n\nThe \"Start,\" \"Settings,\" \"Bet Value,\" and \"Bonus Purchase\" buttons disappear during the rotation of the reels and reappear once the spin is completed.\n\nSlot features\nThe game grid has 6 reels, while the number of lines depends on the size of the symbols: smaller ones occupy 6 slots, larger ones only 2. In the upper part of the frame and corresponding to reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, there is an additional line.

Each of them guarantees a new Free Spin, with 3 symbols we are entitled to 5 additional spins. Each winning combination adds a multiplier x1.\nPrison: in this case, the extra reel disappears in favor of a 6x6 grid. The Cascade functionality is also interrupted. The Wild symbols that appear on the reels remain during all Free Spins, and if you manage to fill the entire grid with them, you are entitled to 5 extra spins.\n\nThe player can also decide to purchase the Bonus.

From a visual point of view, this slot game features all the symbols of the West: hot-handed cowboys, whiskey, dynamite for attacking stagecoaches, and the inevitable sheriff's badge to ensure order in the town. The background is the Grand Canyon, on which the wooden framed grid stands out. The sound department has an epic flair, inspired by the great Westerns that have made cinema successful in the past.\n\nThe \"Start,\" \"Settings,\" \"Bet Value,\" and \"Bonus Purchase\" buttons disappear during the rotation of the reels and reappear once the spin is completed.\n\nSlot features\nThe game grid has 6 reels, while the number of lines depends on the size of the symbols: smaller ones occupy 6 slots, larger ones only 2. In the upper part of the frame and corresponding to reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, there is an additional line. As previously mentioned, there are 117,649 ways to win, with an RTP of 95.21% and medium volatility. The bet ranges from a minimum of 0.20 to a maximum of 20 €. By holding down the Start button, between 5 and 100 automatic spins can be activated, with the possibility of setting win or loss limits.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Desperados Wild Megaways\nLet's start by saying that every time there is a winning combination, the winning symbols disappear and are replaced. As far as their value is concerned, as usual, the playing cards pay the least of all, followed by the whiskey bottle, guns, and dynamite. The symbol with the highest value is the sheriff's badge. The outlaws are the 4 Wild symbols, they have a Jolly function and replace all the symbols except the Bonus one. During normal games, Wild symbols can only appear on the extra line. To access the special levels of the game, it is necessary to have 4 or more Scatter symbols on the reels, represented by the word \"Bonus.\" At this point, the player must choose between two levels, Sunset and Prison. Let's see them in detail:\n\nSunset: with 4 Scatter symbols, you get 8 free spins. During the special game, Bonus symbols can only appear on the upper reel. Each of them guarantees a new Free Spin, with 3 symbols we are entitled to 5 additional spins. Each winning combination adds a multiplier x1.\nPrison: in this case, the extra reel disappears in favor of a 6x6 grid. The Cascade functionality is also interrupted. The Wild symbols that appear on the reels remain during all Free Spins, and if you manage to fill the entire grid with them, you are entitled to 5 extra spins.\n\nThe player can also decide to purchase the Bonus. After choosing which level to play, Sunset or Prison, you have the possibility to decide whether to try to increase the number of Free Spins or lose the entire Bonus. \n\nExperience the thrill of the Wild West and try out Desperados Wild Megaways slot today!\n            ",
