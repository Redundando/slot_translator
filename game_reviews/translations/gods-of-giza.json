While the story isn't necessarily new, the implementation and reliance on 4 reels make for something more interesting to focus on. With a maximum win of up to 400x your bet, while maintaining medium volatility and an RTP of 96.41%, there's plenty of fun to be had. \n\nThe gameplay of Gods of Giza is what really sets it apart. While using 4 reels and 4 rows may seem unusual, it creates a square game background that looks quite different from any other slot you'll come across. This setup has 20 paylines, ensuring that players have a fair set of combinations to draw from. The background of this slot is provided by a potpourri of hieroglyphics that will confuse your mind, along with some overly powerful Egyptian deities that invoke a sense of calm, security, and fear all at once.\n\nYou can spend from €0.20 to €40 per spin in this game, keeping 20 active paylines. This corresponds to a line bet between €0.01 and €2 which should be sufficient for many players. If we look at the highest winnings, Gods of Giza: Enhanced can provide up to €16,000, which is the maximum exposure for a single spin. Given the stakes involved, this would mean a jackpot of up to 400x the bet.\n\nOne of the standout features of the game is the use of rotating reels, which only occurs during the free spins. To trigger this feature, you need scatter symbols to land 3 or more times on the 4 reels at your disposal. This will trigger a free spins feature. There are 8 free spins to start with, but there's a chance that you'll trigger the feature once and get another 8 spins. Up to 16 spins may be available in total.\n\nWhat makes the game special is that the game area rotates 90 degrees, and will do so a total of four times, completing a 360-degree movement. With each partial movement, the symbols found on the 20 paylines will change position, and new wins may occur. This happens for all free spins that are played.\n\nOverall, I like what Gods of Giza: Enhanced is doing with its features. The opportunity to be paid up to four times in a single spin, all while using the same symbols, is going to make for some exciting free spins. On the other hand, to get all that excitement, you need to first reach the feature, as the base game offers nothing interesting. Gods of Giza is not just about the eccentricities. It's also great for traditional gameplay, making it a bit easier for players to find a sense of belonging.",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Gods of Giza\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nGods of Giza: Enhanced slot is the second game to use this title, and Genesis Gaming seems to have wanted an improvement over the original version. The game is inspired by the pyramids of Giza, and while the theme may not be entirely new, the implementation and reliance on 4 reels give it something more interesting to focus on. Designed with 4x4 reels, and featuring a total of 20 active paylines, this game offers maximum winnings up to 400x the bet, while still maintaining Medium volatility. With an RTP of 96.41%, scatters, free spins, rotating reels, and wilds, there's plenty of fun to be had here. If you're looking for a slot game with a twist on the classic Ancient Egypt theme, then this is the game for you.\n\nThe gameplay in Gods of Giza is something that Genesis Gaming has really brought to the forefront. As experienced gamblers, we know that the industry standard is to use 5 reels with 3 rows, but Gods of Giza offers something completely different - a square reel model. With 4 reels and 4 rows, this creates a square playing field that looks quite different from any other slot you'll likely encounter. 20 paylines are used to complete this setup, ensuring that players have a fairly even set of combinations to draw from. While this strange setup might throw players off at first, it definitely intrigues and keeps things exciting until the reels stop spinning.\n\nThe background of this slot is provided by a potpourri of hieroglyphs that will confuse your mind, paired with too powerful Egyptian deities that invoke a sense of calm, security, and fear all at once. It's a unique experience that is incredibly immersive and engaging.\n\nGods of Giza: Enhanced slot machine will cost you anywhere from €0.20 to €40 per spin while also keeping 20 active paylines. This corresponds to a line bet of €0.01 to €2, which should be enough for many players. Winning big in Gods of Giza: Enhanced may get you up to €16,000, which is the maximum exposure it has for a single spin. Given the wagers involved, this would mean a jackpot of up to 400x the bet.\n\nThe game relies heavily on the use of rotating reels, but this occurs only during the free spins. To activate the free spins, you will need scatter symbols to land 3 or more times on the 4 reels at your disposal. This will trigger a free spins feature. There are 8 free spins to start with, but there is a chance that you will trigger the feature again and get another 8 free spins. Up to 16 spins can be available in total.\n\nWhat makes this game special is that the playing area is rotated 90 degrees and will do so a total of four times, completing a full 360-degree rotation. With each partial movement, the symbols found on the 20 paylines will change position, and new wins can occur. This happens for all free spins that are crossed. Overall, Gods of Giza: Enhanced has some exciting features, including exciting free spin rounds that give you the opportunity to be paid up to four times in a single spin.\n\nWith a range of betting options, from a single cent to €200 per spin, this slot has something for every type of experienced gambler. So, don't hesitate to try your luck on Gods of Giza: Enhanced, and you might just walk away with a handsome payout.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame features and mechanics (scatters, free spins, rotating reels, wilds)\nGameplay and theme immersion (pyramids of Giza, Egyptian deities)\nMaximum exposure and jackpot winnings\nBetting options and medium volatility\nRTP percentage and free spin availability\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Gods of Giza: Enhanced slot is the second game to use this title, and Genesis Gaming seems to have wanted an improvement over the original version. The game is inspired by the pyramids of Giza, and while the theme may not be entirely new, the implementation and reliance on 4 reels give it something more interesting to focus on. Designed with 4x4 reels, and featuring a total of 20 active paylines, this game offers maximum winnings up to 400x the bet, while still maintaining Medium volatility. With an RTP of 96.41%, scatters, free spins, rotating reels, and wilds, there's plenty of fun to be had here. If you're looking for a slot game with a twist on the classic Ancient Egypt theme, then this is the game for you.\n\nThe gameplay in Gods of Giza is something that Genesis Gaming has really brought to the forefront. As experienced gamblers, we know that the industry standard is to use 5 reels with 3 rows, but Gods of Giza offers something completely different - a square reel model. With 4 reels and 4 rows, this creates a square playing field that looks quite different from any other slot you'll likely encounter. 20 paylines are used to complete this setup, ensuring that players have a fairly even set of combinations to draw from. While this strange setup might throw players off at first, it definitely intrigues and keeps things exciting until the reels stop spinning.\n\nThe background of this slot is provided by a potpourri of hieroglyphs that will confuse your mind, paired with too powerful Egyptian deities that invoke a sense of calm, security, and fear all at once. It's a unique experience that is incredibly immersive and engaging.\n\nGods of Giza: Enhanced slot machine will cost you anywhere from €0.20 to €40 per spin while also keeping 20 active paylines. This corresponds to a line bet of €0.01 to €2, which should be enough for many players. Winning big in Gods of Giza: Enhanced may get you up to €16,000, which is the maximum exposure it has for a single spin. Given the wagers involved, this would mean a jackpot of up to 400x the bet.\n\nThe game relies heavily on the use of rotating reels, but this occurs only during the free spins. To activate the free spins, you will need scatter symbols to land 3 or more times on the 4 reels at your disposal. This will trigger a free spins feature. There are 8 free spins to start with, but there is a chance that you will trigger the feature again and get another 8 free spins. Up to 16 spins can be available in total.\n\nWhat makes this game special is that the playing area is rotated 90 degrees and will do so a total of four times, completing a full 360-degree rotation. With each partial movement, the symbols found on the 20 paylines will change position, and new wins can occur. This happens for all free spins that are crossed. Overall, Gods of Giza: Enhanced has some exciting features, including exciting free spin rounds that give you the opportunity to be paid up to four times in a single spin.\n\nWith a range of betting options, from a single cent to €200 per spin, this slot has something for every type of experienced gambler. So, don't hesitate to try your luck on Gods of Giza: Enhanced, and you might just walk away with a handsome payout.\n            ",

The game is inspired by the pyramids of Giza, and while the theme may not be entirely new, the implementation and reliance on 4 reels give it something more interesting to focus on. Designed with 4x4 reels, and featuring a total of 20 active paylines, this game offers maximum winnings up to 400x the bet, while still maintaining Medium volatility. With an RTP of 96.41%, scatters, free spins, rotating reels, and wilds, there's plenty of fun to be had here. If you're looking for a slot game with a twist on the classic Ancient Egypt theme, then this is the game for you.\n\nThe gameplay in Gods of Giza is something that Genesis Gaming has really brought to the forefront. As experienced gamblers, we know that the industry standard is to use 5 reels with 3 rows, but Gods of Giza offers something completely different - a square reel model. With 4 reels and 4 rows, this creates a square playing field that looks quite different from any other slot you'll likely encounter. 20 paylines are used to complete this setup, ensuring that players have a fairly even set of combinations to draw from. While this strange setup might throw players off at first, it definitely intrigues and keeps things exciting until the reels stop spinning.\n\nThe background of this slot is provided by a potpourri of hieroglyphs that will confuse your mind, paired with too powerful Egyptian deities that invoke a sense of calm, security, and fear all at once. It's a unique experience that is incredibly immersive and engaging.\n\nGods of Giza: Enhanced slot machine will cost you anywhere from €0.20 to €40 per spin while also keeping 20 active paylines. This corresponds to a line bet of €0.01 to €2, which should be enough for many players. Winning big in Gods of Giza: Enhanced may get you up to €16,000, which is the maximum exposure it has for a single spin. Given the wagers involved, this would mean a jackpot of up to 400x the bet.\n\nThe game relies heavily on the use of rotating reels, but this occurs only during the free spins. To activate the free spins, you will need scatter symbols to land 3 or more times on the 4 reels at your disposal. This will trigger a free spins feature. There are 8 free spins to start with, but there is a chance that you will trigger the feature again and get another 8 free spins. Up to 16 spins can be available in total.\n\nWhat makes this game special is that the playing area is rotated 90 degrees and will do so a total of four times, completing a full 360-degree rotation. With each partial movement, the symbols found on the 20 paylines will change position, and new wins can occur. This happens for all free spins that are crossed.

The game is inspired by the pyramids of Giza, and while the theme may not be entirely new, the implementation and reliance on 4 reels give it something more interesting to focus on. Designed with 4x4 reels, and featuring a total of 20 active paylines, this game offers maximum winnings up to 400x the bet, while still maintaining Medium volatility. With an RTP of 96.41%, scatters, free spins, rotating reels, and wilds, there's plenty of fun to be had here. If you're looking for a slot game with a twist on the classic Ancient Egypt theme, then this is the game for you.\n\nThe gameplay in Gods of Giza is something that Genesis Gaming has really brought to the forefront. As experienced gamblers, we know that the industry standard is to use 5 reels with 3 rows, but Gods of Giza offers something completely different - a square reel model. With 4 reels and 4 rows, this creates a square playing field that looks quite different from any other slot you'll likely encounter. 20 paylines are used to complete this setup, ensuring that players have a fairly even set of combinations to draw from. While this strange setup might throw players off at first, it definitely intrigues and keeps things exciting until the reels stop spinning.\n\nThe background of this slot is provided by a potpourri of hieroglyphs that will confuse your mind, paired with too powerful Egyptian deities that invoke a sense of calm, security, and fear all at once. It's a unique experience that is incredibly immersive and engaging.\n\nGods of Giza: Enhanced slot machine will cost you anywhere from €0.20 to €40 per spin while also keeping 20 active paylines. This corresponds to a line bet of €0.01 to €2, which should be enough for many players. Winning big in Gods of Giza: Enhanced may get you up to €16,000, which is the maximum exposure it has for a single spin. Given the wagers involved, this would mean a jackpot of up to 400x the bet.\n\nThe game relies heavily on the use of rotating reels, but this occurs only during the free spins. To activate the free spins, you will need scatter symbols to land 3 or more times on the 4 reels at your disposal. This will trigger a free spins feature. There are 8 free spins to start with, but there is a chance that you will trigger the feature again and get another 8 free spins. Up to 16 spins can be available in total.\n\nWhat makes this game special is that the playing area is rotated 90 degrees and will do so a total of four times, completing a full 360-degree rotation. With each partial movement, the symbols found on the 20 paylines will change position, and new wins can occur. This happens for all free spins that are crossed. Overall, Gods of Giza: Enhanced has some exciting features, including exciting free spin rounds that give you the opportunity to be paid up to four times in a single spin.\n\nWith a range of betting options, from a single cent to €200 per spin, this slot has something for every type of experienced gambler. So, don't hesitate to try your luck on Gods of Giza: Enhanced, and you might just walk away with a handsome payout.\n            ",
