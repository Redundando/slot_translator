In caso di scommessa giusta la vincita sarà raddoppiata, in caso contrario si perderà il premio iniziale. Per la funzione Gamble si ha dunque una possibilità di vincita random del 50 %.\nIn conclusione\nLinearità, facilità di gioco e molteplici possibilità di vincita sono le caratteristiche che hanno reso Book of Maya una delle slot di punta della Novomatic.\nNon vi stupirà con colonne sonore e grafiche spettacolari, ma vi terrà incollati allo schermo grazie alle numerose funzionalità, giochi bonus e funzione Gamble, adatta ai giocatori più intrepidi.\nSlot simili\nLa tematica delle antiche civiltà è stata ampiamente sviluppata nel mondo delle slot machine.\nMolto simile come tema rispetto a Book of Maya è Mayan Riches della IGT, mentre se ci spostiamo nell’antico Egitto, troviamo la famosissima Book of Ra, ma anche diversi titoli meno noti tra cui Solar Queen.\n",

The amount of the win depends on both the number of symbols that appear on the reel, with a minimum of three, and the value of the symbols themselves, with cards giving the lowest win and figures the highest.\nA much-loved feature in this slot is the ability to customize every bet, choosing the amounts and how many paylines to bet on.\nThe maximum bet on Book of Maya is €1000, and you can increase profits significantly when the Scatter symbol (ancient Maya book) appears on the screen, which pays regardless of its position on the reels.\nIn addition to this, Book of Maya offers the Extra Bet mode, with which you can win additional free spins while playing bonus rounds.\nThe Gamble function is also not missing, which is activated automatically after any win: a hand of playing cards appears, and you can decide to bet on the color, red or black.

Similar slots in the ancient civilization theme include Mayan Riches by IGT and Book of Ra from Novomatic.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics in Book of Maya are not particularly elaborate, but they effectively create a suggestive environment for the game's theme. The initial screen featuring an ancient temple sets the tone for the adventure ahead. Although there are no 3D animations or special effects, the simplicity of the graphics is actually a strength of the game, as it allows players to focus on the gameplay itself.\n\nWagering\n\nBook of Maya offers a customizable bet range from €0.20 to €1000, allowing players to tailor their bets to their individual playing preferences. The maximum bet is relatively high, and there is potential to win big with the Scatter symbol paying out regardless of its position on the reels and the Extra Bet mode offering additional free spins during bonus rounds. The game's Gamble feature also adds an element of risk and reward for the more daring players.\n\nBonus Features\n\nBook of Maya features several bonus features to keep players engaged. The Extra Bet mode offers additional free spins during bonus rounds, while the Gamble feature allows players to double their winnings by correctly guessing the color of a playing card. The Scatter symbol, represented by the ancient Maya book, also pays out regardless of its position on the reels. This, combined with the potential for big wins and the customizable bet range, makes Book of Maya a game worth trying for both casual and experienced slot players.\n\n        \n            ",

The amount of the win depends on the number of symbols that appear on the reel, with a minimum of three, as well as the value of the symbols themselves, with the cards providing the lowest win and the figures the highest.\nA much-loved feature in this slot is the ability to customize every play by choosing the amount to play and how many paylines to bet on.\nThe maximum bet on Book of Maya is €1000, and it is possible to significantly increase winnings when the Scatter symbol (ancient Maya book) appears on the screen, paying regardless of its position on the reels.\nIn addition to this, Book of Maya offers the Extra Bet mode, which allows for additional free spins during bonus rounds.\nThe Gamble feature is also a must, which is activated automatically after any win: a hand of playing cards appears on the screen, and one can choose to bet on the color, red or black. In case of correct bet, the win is doubled, otherwise the initial prize is lost. For the Gamble feature, there is a random chance of winning of 50%.\nIn conclusion\nLinearity, ease of play, and multiple chances of winning are the characteristics that have made Book of Maya one of Novomatic's flagship slots.\nIt won't surprise you with spectacular soundtracks or graphics, but it will keep you glued to the screen thanks to its numerous features, bonus games, and Gamble feature, suitable for the most daring players.\nSimilar Slots\nThe theme of ancient civilizations has been extensively developed in the world of slot machines.\nVery similar in theme to Book of Maya is Mayan Riches by IGT, while if we move to ancient Egypt, we find the famous Book of Ra, as well as several lesser-known titles such as Solar Queen.\n            ",

The amount of the win depends on the number of symbols that appear on the reel, with a minimum of three, as well as the value of the symbols themselves, with the cards providing the lowest win and the figures the highest.\nA much-loved feature in this slot is the ability to customize every play by choosing the amount to play and how many paylines to bet on.\nThe maximum bet on Book of Maya is €1000, and it is possible to significantly increase winnings when the Scatter symbol (ancient Maya book) appears on the screen, paying regardless of its position on the reels.\nIn addition to this, Book of Maya offers the Extra Bet mode, which allows for additional free spins during bonus rounds.\nThe Gamble feature is also a must, which is activated automatically after any win: a hand of playing cards appears on the screen, and one can choose to bet on the color, red or black. In case of correct bet, the win is doubled, otherwise the initial prize is lost. For the Gamble feature, there is a random chance of winning of 50%.\nIn conclusion\nLinearity, ease of play, and multiple chances of winning are the characteristics that have made Book of Maya one of Novomatic's flagship slots.\nIt won't surprise you with spectacular soundtracks or graphics, but it will keep you glued to the screen thanks to its numerous features, bonus games, and Gamble feature, suitable for the most daring players.\nSimilar Slots\nThe theme of ancient civilizations has been extensively developed in the world of slot machines.\nVery similar in theme to Book of Maya is Mayan Riches by IGT, while if we move to ancient Egypt, we find the famous Book of Ra, as well as several lesser-known titles such as Solar Queen.\n            ",
