If four Wild symbols land on the reels, then the Respin Function will activate.\n\nGraphics and Soundtrack\n\nFive Sound Fortune has superlative graphics that create a festive atmosphere, with a street illuminated with red lights and fireworks in the background. The symbols are well-drawn with great attention to detail, and there is an Oriental-themed soundtrack that enhances the overall gaming experience.\n\nBetting and RTP\n\nThe cost per payline is €0.01, and players must bet a minimum of €0.50 to start the game.

There are 50 fixed paylines, with a cost per line set at €0.01. So, to play Five Sound Fortune, you will need at least €0.50 per spin. You win when you create a combination on a payline with symbols progressing from left to right. In case of multiple wins on the same line, only the highest one will be paid, while if the combos occur on different lines, then the amounts will be summed up. \n\nA Classic Game with Some Interesting Features \n\nThe ten regular symbols are divided into two groups: low-value and high-value.
