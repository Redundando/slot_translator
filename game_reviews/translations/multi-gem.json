And like all great classics, these are the slots that players become most fond of. Bally Wulff has chosen a simple graphic design, without extensive animations, but the attention given to defining the symbols is predominant. The game grid has a purple background, with the numbers of the active paylines on the frame. On the lower part, there are buttons to raise or lower the bet value, the button to set the highest bet in one fell swoop, Autoplay and Start buttons. The sound section is limited to arcade music interspersed with the mechanical sound of the reels spinning.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nThe grid remains classic, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 10 and fixed, while the bet goes from a minimum of 10 coins to a maximum of 1,000. Autoplay can be used, but a predetermined number of spins cannot be selected. You will simply decide when to stop it by clicking on the same button and return to manual mode. The RTP value is 96.4%, while the volatility is high, therefore, you will win less frequently, but the amounts will always be significant.\n\nSymbols and features of Multi Gem\nFirst of all, it should be mentioned that unlike many other slots, here we can win with combinations of adjacent symbols starting from left to right, but also those that start from right to left and even from the center.\n\nIn Multi Gem, we have eight regular symbols and a special one. Those that are worth less are the green, blue, and orange triangular gems, then there are the hexagonal ones, and finally the circular ones. The symbol that is worth the most is the framed white diamond, considering that with a bet of 10 coins, we can win up to 5,000 if a combination of 5 diamonds appears! The special symbol X has a dual function, that of a Wild and a multiplier. First of all, it replaces all symbols, and also acts as a 2x, 3x, or 7x multiplier.\n\nIn addition, Multi Gem also has two gambling functions. After each winning combination, we will be asked if we want to cash the amount or, alternatively, bet on it. If we choose the second option, we will have the opportunity to choose between the card game or the tower. In the first game, we will have to guess the color of the card drawn from the deck, while in the second case, we will have to be good at identifying which amount will be highlighted on a tower with rising prizes.",

Therefore, we can define it as a great classic of online gaming. And like all great classics, these are the slots that players become most fond of. Bally Wulff has chosen a simple graphic design, without extensive animations, but the attention given to defining the symbols is predominant. The game grid has a purple background, with the numbers of the active paylines on the frame. On the lower part, there are buttons to raise or lower the bet value, the button to set the highest bet in one fell swoop, Autoplay and Start buttons. The sound section is limited to arcade music interspersed with the mechanical sound of the reels spinning.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nThe grid remains classic, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 10 and fixed, while the bet goes from a minimum of 10 coins to a maximum of 1,000. Autoplay can be used, but a predetermined number of spins cannot be selected. You will simply decide when to stop it by clicking on the same button and return to manual mode. The RTP value is 96.4%, while the volatility is high, therefore, you will win less frequently, but the amounts will always be significant.\n\nSymbols and features of Multi Gem\nFirst of all, it should be mentioned that unlike many other slots, here we can win with combinations of adjacent symbols starting from left to right, but also those that start from right to left and even from the center.\n\nIn Multi Gem, we have eight regular symbols and a special one. Those that are worth less are the green, blue, and orange triangular gems, then there are the hexagonal ones, and finally the circular ones. The symbol that is worth the most is the framed white diamond, considering that with a bet of 10 coins, we can win up to 5,000 if a combination of 5 diamonds appears! The special symbol X has a dual function, that of a Wild and a multiplier. First of all, it replaces all symbols, and also acts as a 2x, 3x, or 7x multiplier.\n\nIn addition, Multi Gem also has two gambling functions. After each winning combination, we will be asked if we want to cash the amount or, alternatively, bet on it. If we choose the second option, we will have the opportunity to choose between the card game or the tower. In the first game, we will have to guess the color of the card drawn from the deck, while in the second case, we will have to be good at identifying which amount will be highlighted on a tower with rising prizes.\n            ",

Developed by Bally Wulff, this slot game has a simple graphic design with well-defined symbols and a purple background. It has a standard grid of 5 reels and 3 rows with 10 fixed paylines that allow players to bet from a minimum of 10 coins up to a maximum of 1,000 coins. The game has an Autoplay feature, but the number of spins cannot be predetermined. The RTP value of Multi Gem is 96.4%, and the game is known for its high volatility. \n\nGame Design and Paylines\n\nMulti Gem has a minimalist game design with a purple background and well-defined symbols. The game has a grid of 5 reels and 3 rows with 10 fixed paylines. The numbers of the active paylines are displayed on the frame of the game. The lower section of the game screen has buttons to control the bet value, the highest bet, Autoplay, and Start. There is no extensive animation in this game, and the sound section only has arcade music interspersed with the mechanical sound of the reels spinning.\n\nSymbols and Payouts\n\nIn Multi Gem, there are eight regular symbols of different shapes and colors, starting with green, blue, and orange triangular gems, hexagonal gems, and circular gems. The most valuable symbol is the framed white diamond, which can give a winning amount of up to 5,000 coins with a bet of 10 coins. The game also has a special symbol, the X, which acts as a Wild and as a multiplier with 2x, 3x, or 7x multipliers. In Multi Gem, players can win with combinations of adjacent symbols starting from left to right, right to left, and even from the center.\n\nSpecial Symbol and Bonus Features\n\nThe special symbol X in Multi Gem has a dual function of acting as a Wild and as a multiplier with three different values, 2x, 3x, or 7x. It replaces all other symbols to create winning combinations and multiplies the winning amount accordingly. Multi Gem also has two gambling functions for players to increase their winnings. After every winning combination, players can choose to either collect the amount or gamble it. By choosing the gambling option, players can play either the card game or the tower game. In the card game, players have to guess the color of the card drawn from a deck, while in the tower game, players must identify which amount will be highlighted on a tower with rising prizes.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nMulti Gem has an RTP value of 96.4%, which is above average and ensures decent returns for players. The game is known for its high volatility, which means that players may not win as frequently but will receive significant payouts when they do win. This game is suitable for players who enjoy risk-taking and prefer the thrill of potentially winning big prizes.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame Design\n\nMulti Gem features a classic slot machine grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The game design is simple, without extensive animations, but the attention given to defining the symbols is predominant. The game frame displays a purple background with active paylines numbers. The lower part of the frame contains buttons to raise or lower the bet value, set the highest bet in one fell swoop, Autoplay, and Start buttons. The sound section is limited to arcade music interspersed with the mechanical sound of the reels spinning.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nIn Multi Gem, we have eight regular symbols and a special one. The paylines are 10 and fixed. Unlike many other slots, players can win with combinations of adjacent symbols starting from left to right, but also those that start from right to left and even from the center. The symbols worth less are the green, blue, and orange triangular gems, followed by the hexagonal ones, and finally, the circular gems. The highest paying symbol is the white diamond, which can bring a win of up to 5,000 coins with a bet of 10 coins and a combination of 5 diamonds.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nMulti Gem has an RTP value of 96.4%, which is higher than the industry average. However, the volatility is high, meaning players win less frequently but with significant amounts. The minimum bet is 10 coins, while the maximum bet is 1,000 coins. Autoplay is available, but players cannot select a predetermined number of spins. Instead, they decide when to stop Autoplay by clicking on the same button and return to manual mode.\n\nSpecial Symbols and Features\n\nMulti Gem features a special symbol X that acts as both a Wild and a multiplier. X replaces all symbols and can also be a 2x, 3x, or 7x multiplier. After each winning combination, players can either cash out the amount or bet on it using the two gambling functions available. The card game requires players to guess the color of the card drawn from the deck, while the tower game requires them to select the amount highlighted on a tower with rising prizes.\n\nGambling Functions\n\nMulti Gem has two gambling functions available. After each winning combination, players can either cash out the amount or bet on it using the card game or tower game. The card game requires players to guess the color of the card drawn from the deck, while the tower game requires them to select the amount highlighted on a tower with rising prizes.\n\n        \n            ",

Therefore, we can define it as a great classic of online gaming. And like all great classics, these are the slots that players become most fond of. Bally Wulff has chosen a simple graphic design, without extensive animations, but the attention given to defining the symbols is predominant. The game grid has a purple background, with the numbers of the active paylines on the frame. On the lower part, there are buttons to raise or lower the bet value, the button to set the highest bet in one fell swoop, Autoplay and Start buttons. The sound section is limited to arcade music interspersed with the mechanical sound of the reels spinning.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nThe grid remains classic, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 10 and fixed, while the bet goes from a minimum of 10 coins to a maximum of 1,000. Autoplay can be used, but a predetermined number of spins cannot be selected. You will simply decide when to stop it by clicking on the same button and return to manual mode. The RTP value is 96.4%, while the volatility is high, therefore, you will win less frequently, but the amounts will always be significant.\n\nSymbols and features of Multi Gem\nFirst of all, it should be mentioned that unlike many other slots, here we can win with combinations of adjacent symbols starting from left to right, but also those that start from right to left and even from the center.\n\nIn Multi Gem, we have eight regular symbols and a special one. Those that are worth less are the green, blue, and orange triangular gems, then there are the hexagonal ones, and finally the circular ones. The symbol that is worth the most is the framed white diamond, considering that with a bet of 10 coins, we can win up to 5,000 if a combination of 5 diamonds appears! The special symbol X has a dual function, that of a Wild and a multiplier. First of all, it replaces all symbols, and also acts as a 2x, 3x, or 7x multiplier.\n\nIn addition, Multi Gem also has two gambling functions. After each winning combination, we will be asked if we want to cash the amount or, alternatively, bet on it. If we choose the second option, we will have the opportunity to choose between the card game or the tower. In the first game, we will have to guess the color of the card drawn from the deck, while in the second case, we will have to be good at identifying which amount will be highlighted on a tower with rising prizes.\n        ",
