Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\nMega Joker is a slot machine that revisits tradition in a modern way, offering versatile and captivating gameplay, suitable for both new and experienced players. The graphics are impactful and loved by fans of old-school slots. The special Gamble feature allows players to customize their gameplay and risk their winnings for the chance to double their payout.\n\nSymbols\n\nMega Joker follows the symbolism of classic fruit machines, with colorful fruits comprising the lower-paying symbols. The symbols can be divided into tiers, with the cherries, oranges, lemons, and plums being the lowest-paying, followed by grapes and watermelons, and pears and strawberries paying 50% more. The most valuable symbol is the number 7. The Joker acts as the Wild symbol, and the golden star is the Scatter symbol, offering substantial payouts.\n\nScatter\n\nThe Scatter symbol in Mega Joker is a golden star, which offers substantial payouts. If it appears three times on a payline, in any position, it pays out a prize that amounts to a whopping 160 times the bet! If the Scatter appears on the reels five times, players can see their bet multiplied by up to 16,000 times!\n\nRTP\n\nMega Joker has an RTP of over 95%, guaranteeing frequent winnings for players. With its high multipliers, even low bets can lead to substantial payouts.\n\nGamble Feature\n\nThe Gamble feature in Mega Joker allows players to double their winnings by correctly guessing the color of a playing card. This feature, combined with the high multipliers in regular gameplay, offers a really juicy winning opportunity, but also carries the risk of losing the entire jackpot.\n\n        \n            ",

But that's not all, what makes Mega Joker a unique slot machine is the possibility of seeing the amount of one's bet multiplied by up to 16,000 times when the Scatter appears on the reels five times!\nMega Joker also offers the opportunity to double one's winnings with the Gamble feature, and given the multipliers in regular gameplay, it is a really juicy winning opportunity!\nIf one is willing to take the risk, a playing card will appear on the screen, and the color must be guessed, whether it is red or black. The right choice will result in the doubling of the entire jackpot!\n\nConclusions\nMega Joker is a slot machine where tradition and innovation mix skillfully, offering a truly exciting gaming experience!\nThe graphics, although without special effects or 3D animations, are impactful, and loved especially by those who prefer old-school slot machines.\nThe gameplay mechanism is simple but customizable thanks to the special Gamble feature, making Mega Joker suitable for both those who are new to the world of slot machines and for more daring players who are not afraid to risk their winnings with \"double or nothing\".\nThe payout rate (RTP) is over 95%, a guarantee of frequent winnings, and the high multipliers allow one to get their hands on really substantial prizes even with low bets.\n        ",
