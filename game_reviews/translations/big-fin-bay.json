The golden Marlin serves as the game's Wild symbol, substituting for all other symbols and expanding to cover the entire reel when it appears in a winning combination. And let me tell ya, that Marlin sure knows how to make a splash!</p><p>On the other hand, the Scatter symbol is represented by an anchor. Land three anchors on the reels in the same spin, and you'll trigger the free spins feature. Now, I'm not much of a sailor, but I do know that three anchors in one place can make quite a mess. Luckily, in Big Fin Bay, they trigger something awesome!</p><p>The number of free spins you receive is determined by the numbers indicated on each reel, but remember, it cannot exceed six. However, things get even more interesting when a Wild symbol appears during the free spins feature. That wild will grow by one slot and stay that size for the remaining spins. And if you manage to fill seven positions and cover the entire reel in Wild symbols, you'll receive three more free spins. Who said that greed isn't good?</p><p>During the bonus rounds of Big Fin Bay, the number of winning sequences goes up to an impressive 117,649. And trust me, that's a lot of winning. So, let's get those reels spinning and see if we can hit that big win!</p>\"}"

The number of rows changes with every spin, and there are 7 reels. It's a simple but engaging game, suitable for all types of players. The RTP is 96.14%, and the volatility is high, with less frequent wins but high payouts. The game has affordable bet limits ranging from 0.10 € to a maximum of 100 € per spin. There are automatic spins ranging from 5 to 5,000.\n\nGraphics and overall design\n\nBig Fin Bay has impressive graphics that resemble cartoons, and the game is set against an enchanting bay background. The wooden frame surrounds the game grid. The game's console is located at the bottom, and catchy tunes accompany the gameplay. The game also has sound effects that accompany any wins, which can both be turned off at any time. \n\nVariable game scheme\n\nBig Fin Bay has a variable game scheme, meaning that the number of rows changes with each spin, which adds to the excitement of the game. In one spin, players can find two symbols, three symbols, and up to a maximum of seven symbols on each reel. However, the number of reels always remains seven. \n\nSymbols and paylines\n\nBig Fin Bay has low and high-level symbols. The former includes the poker scale symbols from 9 to Ace, while the latter includes trophy fish of different colors and the fisherman. Players win by matching symbols from left to right, and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, the one with the highest number of symbols is paid out. During regular play, the Mystery function may be activated, in which 3 random reels become Wild. \n\nWild and Scatter symbols\n\nBig Fin Bay's Wild symbol is the golden Marlin, which substitutes for all other symbols, and when it appears in a winning combination, it expands to cover the entire reel. The game's Scatter symbol is the anchor, and if it appears 3 times on the reels in the same spin, it rewards players with free spins. The number of free spins depends on the number indicated on each reel, but it cannot exceed 6. If a Wild symbol appears during the free spins, it grows by one slot and retains its new size for the remaining spins. If seven positions are filled and the entire reel is covered in Wild symbols, three more free spins are awarded. During bonus rounds, the winning sequences are an impressive 117,649. \n\n        \n            ",

A catchy tune accompanies us during the game, and it's accompanied by sound effects that follow any wins. Both can be turned off at any time by accessing the internal menu.\n\nMain Features of the Slot Machine\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, \"Big Fin Bay\" has a variable game scheme, which means that the number of rows changes with every spin: in one spin we can find two symbols, three symbols, and up to a maximum of seven symbols on each reel. However, the number of reels always remains seven.\n\nYou win by matching symbols from left to right, and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, the one with the highest number of symbols is paid out.\n\nWe can say that this slot machine is suitable for all types of players: the gameplay is simple but also very engaging, and the cost is affordable to everyone, as you can bet from a minimum of 0.10 € to a maximum of 100 € per spin.\n\nThere are a total of 5,040 ways to win and automatic spins range from 5 to 5,000.

The first group includes symbols that correspond to the poker scale, from 9 to Ace, while the second group includes trophy fish of different colors and the fisherman.\n\nThe Wild symbol is the golden Marlin, and in addition to substituting for all other symbols, when it appears in a winning combination, it expands to cover the entire reel. During regular play, the Mystery function may be activated, in which 3 random reels become Wild.\n\nThe anchor is the Scatter symbol, and if it appears 3 times on the reels in the same spin, it rewards us with free spins. The number of free spins depends on the number indicated on each reel, but it cannot exceed 6. For example, if the number 3 is on the second reel, the number 5 on the third reel, and the number 6 on the fourth reel, we will receive 14 free spins. If a Wild symbol appears during the free spins, it grows by one slot and retains its new size for the remaining spins. If seven positions are filled and the entire reel is covered in Wild symbols, three more free spins are awarded. During bonus rounds, the winning sequences are an impressive 117,649.\n            ",
