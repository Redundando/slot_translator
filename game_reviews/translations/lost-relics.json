This is especially true for ancient civilizations, which is why there are countless slots that use ancient Greece, Egypt, and pre-Columbian peoples as themes. NetEnt's Lost Relics moves in a slightly different direction: rather than choosing a specific historical period, this slot wants to embody an archaeologist searching for lost artifacts that have no age or population. Therefore, among the various symbols, as we will see shortly, we can find objects belonging to different historical periods, in search of the treasure they guard.\n\nLet's not waste any time and find out what Lost Relics has to offer.\n\nLost Relics: Graphics and Visuals\nThe motto behind this point in our reviews is always the same: \"The eye also wants its share.\" How a slot machine visually presents itself is the business card it offers to its players, which is why it plays a fundamental role in our analysis.\n\nNetEnt's Lost Relics immediately shows itself to be a slot machine of excellent taste: the frame of the explorer protagonist of the slot surrounds the game grid. The various symbols found within the game screen refer to different populations and historical periods.\n\nThe illustrations chosen for these symbols demonstrate great care and attention to detail, so much so that the player's first impression upon arriving at the slot is that of being in front of an intricate and wonderful mosaic. This sense of wonder is maintained by the gameplay mechanics, as we will see in the next point.\n\nLost Relics: Gameplay\nUpon seeing the game grid for the first time, we immediately realize that what we have in front of us is not a slot like many others: instead of using the classic 5x3 mechanics common in most online slots, NetEnt has taken a step further by proposing a title unique in its kind.\n\nThe mechanism proposed in this case is in fact a 5x5 that has the possibility of showing twenty-five symbols for each spin instead of the traditional fifteen. We are not talking about real paylines, but \"clusters\": the game awards a win the moment at least six symbols alike are arranged in a cluster. By cluster, we mean a sequence of identical symbols attached to each other horizontally or vertically, and of course, the maximum value that a cluster can reach here is 25.\n\nThis means that it is very difficult to obtain winning combinations, but it is possible to obtain high wins when they appear and that it is therefore necessary to organize one's gaming experience accordingly, keeping in mind that the slot is rich in special features and symbols that can make the gameplay extremely varied.\n\nSlots similar to Lost Relics\nAs previously stated, the historical theme of the various populations that have ruled the earth is very dear to slot machine developers. NetEnt itself offers other titles that tackle the same topic differently, such as the famous slot Gonzo's Quest. The same can be said of all the other development houses, as it is a very common theme among experienced gamblers.\n            ",

This is especially true for ancient civilizations, which is why there are countless slots that use ancient Greece, Egypt, and pre-Columbian peoples as themes. NetEnt's Lost Relics moves in a slightly different direction: rather than choosing a specific historical period, this slot wants to embody an archaeologist searching for lost artifacts that have no age or population. Therefore, among the various symbols, as we will see shortly, we can find objects belonging to different historical periods, in search of the treasure they guard.\n\nLet's not waste any time and find out what Lost Relics has to offer.\n\nLost Relics: Graphics and Visuals\nThe motto behind this point in our reviews is always the same: \"The eye also wants its share.\" How a slot machine visually presents itself is the business card it offers to its players, which is why it plays a fundamental role in our analysis.\n\nNetEnt's Lost Relics immediately shows itself to be a slot machine of excellent taste: the frame of the explorer protagonist of the slot surrounds the game grid. The various symbols found within the game screen refer to different populations and historical periods.\n\nThe illustrations chosen for these symbols demonstrate great care and attention to detail, so much so that the player's first impression upon arriving at the slot is that of being in front of an intricate and wonderful mosaic. This sense of wonder is maintained by the gameplay mechanics, as we will see in the next point.\n\nLost Relics: Gameplay\nUpon seeing the game grid for the first time, we immediately realize that what we have in front of us is not a slot like many others: instead of using the classic 5x3 mechanics common in most online slots, NetEnt has taken a step further by proposing a title unique in its kind.\n\nThe mechanism proposed in this case is in fact a 5x5 that has the possibility of showing twenty-five symbols for each spin instead of the traditional fifteen. We are not talking about real paylines, but \"clusters\": the game awards a win the moment at least six symbols alike are arranged in a cluster. By cluster, we mean a sequence of identical symbols attached to each other horizontally or vertically, and of course, the maximum value that a cluster can reach here is 25.\n\nThis means that it is very difficult to obtain winning combinations, but it is possible to obtain high wins when they appear and that it is therefore necessary to organize one's gaming experience accordingly, keeping in mind that the slot is rich in special features and symbols that can make the gameplay extremely varied.\n\nSlots similar to Lost Relics\nAs previously stated, the historical theme of the various populations that have ruled the earth is very dear to slot machine developers. NetEnt itself offers other titles that tackle the same topic differently, such as the famous slot Gonzo's Quest. The same can be said of all the other development houses, as it is a very common theme among experienced gamblers.\n            ",

Therefore, among the various symbols, as we will see shortly, we can find objects belonging to different historical periods, in search of the treasure they guard.\n\nLet's not waste any time and find out what Lost Relics has to offer.\n\nLost Relics: Graphics and Visuals\nThe motto behind this point in our reviews is always the same: \"The eye also wants its share.\" How a slot machine visually presents itself is the business card it offers to its players, which is why it plays a fundamental role in our analysis.\n\nNetEnt's Lost Relics immediately shows itself to be a slot machine of excellent taste: the frame of the explorer protagonist of the slot surrounds the game grid. The various symbols found within the game screen refer to different populations and historical periods.\n\nThe illustrations chosen for these symbols demonstrate great care and attention to detail, so much so that the player's first impression upon arriving at the slot is that of being in front of an intricate and wonderful mosaic. This sense of wonder is maintained by the gameplay mechanics, as we will see in the next point.\n\nLost Relics: Gameplay\nUpon seeing the game grid for the first time, we immediately realize that what we have in front of us is not a slot like many others: instead of using the classic 5x3 mechanics common in most online slots, NetEnt has taken a step further by proposing a title unique in its kind.\n\nThe mechanism proposed in this case is in fact a 5x5 that has the possibility of showing twenty-five symbols for each spin instead of the traditional fifteen. We are not talking about real paylines, but \"clusters\": the game awards a win the moment at least six symbols alike are arranged in a cluster. By cluster, we mean a sequence of identical symbols attached to each other horizontally or vertically, and of course, the maximum value that a cluster can reach here is 25.\n\nThis means that it is very difficult to obtain winning combinations, but it is possible to obtain high wins when they appear and that it is therefore necessary to organize one's gaming experience accordingly, keeping in mind that the slot is rich in special features and symbols that can make the gameplay extremely varied.\n\nSlots similar to Lost Relics\nAs previously stated, the historical theme of the various populations that have ruled the earth is very dear to slot machine developers. NetEnt itself offers other titles that tackle the same topic differently, such as the famous slot Gonzo's Quest. The same can be said of all the other development houses, as it is a very common theme among experienced gamblers.\n        ",
