The top prize of 25,000 can be won by landing a combination of three Double Jeopardy symbols and a couple of Jeopardy symbols. Just five Jeopardy symbols will still get you a delicious prize of 12,500 euros!\n\nTelevision Quiz Graphics\n\nJeopardy features five reels and nine paylines, with a pick-em bonus feature. If you are wondering about the RTP percentage of this IGT game, we'll tell you that it is solidly below average at 95%.\n\nAs soon as you launch the game, you'll feel like you're almost in front of the big Jeopardy screen. The game symbols are all related to the theme and represent categories of knowledge, as well as some bonus symbols. The highest paying symbol in Jeopardy slots is the Jeopardy logo, which can bring you 2500 credits. However, you could win even more if lady luck is on your side.\n\nThis is possible with the Double Jeopardy 2x Wild that substitutes all standard game symbols to help you form a winning combination and provides you with a 2x multiplier!\n\nJeopardy slots can be particularly lucrative, especially if you're lucky enough to get the right combination of three Double Jeopardy symbols and two Jeopardy symbols while playing with the maximum possible bet, as this could get you 25,000 times your coin size. The game doesn't require any knowledge like the TV show and has plenty of ways to win, which is always a good thing in online slots.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nPayouts in Jeopardy slots are awarded for landing combinations of identical symbols on paylines. All symbols reward payouts for combinations of three, four, and five identical symbols on paylines.\n\nCategory symbols start with ANIMALS, which award 5, 25, and 75, followed by MOVIES with 7, 35, and 125, MUSIC with 9, 45, and 150, SCIENCE with 12, 60, and 175, while SPORTS will give you 15, 75, and 200.\n\nCombinations of any JEOPARDY logo symbols will give you 5, 15, and 45, a blue JEOPARDY logo will give you 10, 50, and 150, a yellow Double JEOPARDY logo will give you 20, 100, and 300, while a Triple JEOPARDY logo will give you 30, 150, and 450.\n\nCombinations of any seven will pay 10, 30, and 90, blue seven will give you 45, 250, and 600, orange seven will give you 65, 325, and 750, while red seven will give you 75, 400, and 1000.\n\nSpecial symbols start with the JEOPARDY wild that awards 5, 90, 500, and 2500, while the game's highest wins are awarded by the DOUBLE JEOPARDY 2xWILD with 25,000.\n\nThis bonus feature is activated by landing three of the Risk Bonus symbols on any active payline. When this happens, you'll be taken to a new bonus tab consisting of 30 Jeopardy screens. You must click on the screens to reveal your prizes and collect them. Keep clicking until you reveal the Daily Double symbol that doubles your winnings or until you reveal the Final Jeopardy symbol.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nJeopardy is a famous American TV show that has never made it to Italy. For this reason, we may not understand many of the details. If you're a fan of game shows, we recommend Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, the Megaways-produced slot machine that will transport you to an episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire!\n            ",

When this happens, you'll be taken to a new bonus tab consisting of 30 Jeopardy screens. You must click on the screens to reveal your prizes and collect them. Keep clicking until you reveal the Daily Double symbol that doubles your winnings or until you reveal the Final Jeopardy symbol.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nJeopardy is a famous American TV show that has never made it to Italy. For this reason, we may not understand many of the details.
