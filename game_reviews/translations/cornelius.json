And indeed, the new game signed by NetEnt is set in an old-fashioned kitchen, with a mint green fridge on the right and Cornelius' red bowl on the left. Just a few steps away is our friendly orange tabby, wearing a green shirt that's now too tight for him. In his paw, of course, our friend is holding a cookie and occasionally scratching his exposed belly. The graphics are enriched by animations and a style that draws on that of cartoons, while the background music is a cheerful tune that keeps us company during our spins.\nAn extra-large game grid and excellent RTP\nNetEnt has opted for a classic 5x4 grid and 1024 ways to win. The minimum bet for each spin is €0.20, which can be increased to a maximum of €400. To win, players must match adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right.\nThe volatility is medium and the RTP value is 96.04%.\nA truly special bonus game\nIn Cornelius, we find different symbols of different values. These range from classic playing cards from 10 to ace to the fish-shaped toy, the milk jar, the little box, and Cornelius himself, who is also the highest-paying symbol.\nAs for the bonus symbols, the most important is the Cash Drop symbol, a plate of cookies that pays out from 0.25 to 3 times the bet in the base game. When 3 of these symbols land on the reels, the Cash Drop feature is activated. Essentially, every time Cash Drop symbols appear, they give a payout ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 the bet. Moreover, these symbols drop down by one row on each spin. The counter on the right is set to three and every time a new Cash Drop symbol appears, the counting starts over.\nThe jar with cookies is our Scatter symbol and if 3 or more land on the reels, the Free Spins are triggered. In addition to the Cash Drop feature, we have other special symbols:\n\nUp: moves all Cash Drop symbols and multipliers up by one row\nGolden Up: moves symbols to the top row for free\nAdder: has a value printed on it and increases the value of symbols at the end of the bonus game\nMultiplier: multiplies the value of Cash Drop symbols and multipliers\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions \nCan I play for free?\n\nCertainly! We have the option to play in Play for Fun mode, to get familiar with the game without spending anything!\n\nIs there a Wild symbol?\n\nNo, in this slot we only have a Scatter symbol and a Cash Drop symbol.\n\nCan I also play on mobile?\n\nCertainly, Cornelius is available for both tablets and smartphones, in addition to computers.\n            ",

And indeed, the new game signed by NetEnt is set in an old-fashioned kitchen, with a mint green fridge on the right and Cornelius' red bowl on the left. Just a few steps away is our friendly orange tabby, wearing a green shirt that's now too tight for him. In his paw, of course, our friend is holding a cookie and occasionally scratching his exposed belly. The graphics are enriched by animations and a style that draws on that of cartoons, while the background music is a cheerful tune that keeps us company during our spins.\nAn extra-large game grid and excellent RTP\nNetEnt has opted for a classic 5x4 grid and 1024 ways to win. The minimum bet for each spin is €0.20, which can be increased to a maximum of €400. To win, players must match adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right.\nThe volatility is medium and the RTP value is 96.04%.\nA truly special bonus game\nIn Cornelius, we find different symbols of different values. These range from classic playing cards from 10 to ace to the fish-shaped toy, the milk jar, the little box, and Cornelius himself, who is also the highest-paying symbol.\nAs for the bonus symbols, the most important is the Cash Drop symbol, a plate of cookies that pays out from 0.25 to 3 times the bet in the base game. When 3 of these symbols land on the reels, the Cash Drop feature is activated. Essentially, every time Cash Drop symbols appear, they give a payout ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 the bet. Moreover, these symbols drop down by one row on each spin. The counter on the right is set to three and every time a new Cash Drop symbol appears, the counting starts over.\nThe jar with cookies is our Scatter symbol and if 3 or more land on the reels, the Free Spins are triggered. In addition to the Cash Drop feature, we have other special symbols:\n\nUp: moves all Cash Drop symbols and multipliers up by one row\nGolden Up: moves symbols to the top row for free\nAdder: has a value printed on it and increases the value of symbols at the end of the bonus game\nMultiplier: multiplies the value of Cash Drop symbols and multipliers\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions \nCan I play for free?\n\nCertainly! We have the option to play in Play for Fun mode, to get familiar with the game without spending anything!\n\nIs there a Wild symbol?\n\nNo, in this slot we only have a Scatter symbol and a Cash Drop symbol.\n\nCan I also play on mobile?\n\nCertainly, Cornelius is available for both tablets and smartphones, in addition to computers.\n            ",
