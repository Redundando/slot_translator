We do wish there were some more animations in the game though, perhaps something light and breezy like a Shaolin monk doing a cartwheel. </p>\n\n<p>Despite the lack of animation, we have to give props to TPG for the easy-to-use buttons. They're large and feel great to press - no awkward fiddling around with tiny buttons here! The game runs incredibly smoothly too, you won't experience any annoying slowdowns. And let's not forget about the background music. It's got that classic oriental feel that's just perfect for a game like this - we won't lie, we may have ended up putting the game on mute and blasting some of our own tunes after a while, but that's just because we're rebels.</p>"

The symbols are larger than life and represent some of the most sacred animals in Chinese culture. You'll see dragons, phoenixes, and more - all brought to life with fantastic detail! We do wish there were some more animations in the game though, perhaps something light and breezy like a Shaolin monk doing a cartwheel. </p>\n\n<p>Despite the lack of animation, we have to give props to TPG for the easy-to-use buttons. They're large and feel great to press - no awkward fiddling around with tiny buttons here! The game runs incredibly smoothly too, you won't experience any annoying slowdowns. And let's not forget about the background music. It's got that classic oriental feel that's just perfect for a game like this - we won't lie, we may have ended up putting the game on mute and blasting some of our own tunes after a while, but that's just because we're rebels.</p>\"\n}"

That being said, the mechanics of the game are smooth and responsive, with no annoying slowdowns or glitches - so you can focus on racking up those big wins!</p><p>There aren't any flashy animations in this game, but that's okay - sometimes less is more! The game is accompanied by Oriental-style music that sets the mood nicely, but if you're the type of player who likes to listen to your own tunes, you can easily mute it with the click of a button.

Winning combinations are considered those composed of adjacent identical symbols, starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. The winning combos will always be indicated by a golden line.\nFrom the keypad below the grid, you can activate automatic spins and the reel rotation accelerator.\nMany golden symbols for super combos!\nPlaying Golden Dragon is like taking a dive into Chinese culture while sitting in your own armchair. This is possible thanks to the 10 regular symbols and the two special ones.\nLet's start with the least valuable symbols, the animals: phoenix, cat, turtle, and koi carp. Following in order of remuneration, we find the colored mandalas and the golden tree, which besides being a paying symbol, also covers the function of the Scatter. Based on the number of symbols appearing on the reels, we can access a variable number of Free Spins. It goes from a minimum of 8 free spins with 3 Scatters to a maximum of 24 with 5 Scatters.\nDuring the free spins, the gold coins that appear on the reels remain fixed for the entire Bonus Game. Only at the end of the Free Spins, each coin will reveal its value, ensuring us very high-level winnings.\nThis particular feature is also activated if at least six gold coins appear during regular gameplay.

All symbols are large, some represent sacred animals such as the koi carp and the turtle, others fantastic beasts such as the dragon or the phoenix.\nFrom a graphic point of view, Golden Dragon appears to have good definition, although perhaps more effort could have been made on the style. Venial sin, especially given the fact that the game mechanics are smooth and without annoying slowdowns. There are no animations, but we expected that, knowing how much TPG prefers to focus on the essentials. Not for nothing are the buttons very large, making the gameplay more comfortable. Some keys are arranged on the right side, others on the bottom bar.\nThe oriental music is very soft, not at all intrusive, but there is a button on the screen that allows you to mute it.\nMain features of the slot machine\nWe can also understand TPG's love of tradition from the choice of the grid size, which has 5 reels and 3 rows. One of the best features of this slot is the large number of ways to win, 243 to be exact. Winning combinations are considered those composed of adjacent identical symbols, starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. The winning combos will always be indicated by a golden line.\nFrom the keypad below the grid, you can activate automatic spins and the reel rotation accelerator.\nMany golden symbols for super combos!\nPlaying Golden Dragon is like taking a dive into Chinese culture while sitting in your own armchair. This is possible thanks to the 10 regular symbols and the two special ones.\nLet's start with the least valuable symbols, the animals: phoenix, cat, turtle, and koi carp. Following in order of remuneration, we find the colored mandalas and the golden tree, which besides being a paying symbol, also covers the function of the Scatter. Based on the number of symbols appearing on the reels, we can access a variable number of Free Spins. It goes from a minimum of 8 free spins with 3 Scatters to a maximum of 24 with 5 Scatters.\nDuring the free spins, the gold coins that appear on the reels remain fixed for the entire Bonus Game. Only at the end of the Free Spins, each coin will reveal its value, ensuring us very high-level winnings.\nThis particular feature is also activated if at least six gold coins appear during regular gameplay. In this case, the Free Spins will be 5.\n        ",
