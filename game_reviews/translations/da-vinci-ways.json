Libera il tuo senso artistico e scopri tutto ciò che ha da offrirti questa macchinetta online che è stata realizzata da High 5 Games. Sarà come fare un viaggio nell’Italia del rinascimento, pur sapendo di avere a che fare con funzioni innovative che sono l’emblema della modernità al gioco. E così, sui cinque rulli potrai divertirti a trovare 243 modi per vincere, ammirando le più belle opere mai realizzate dal pittore e genio italiano. \nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nNon capita proprio tutti i giorni ma è interessante vedere come una slot online possa animarsi partendo dal tema della cultura e dalla storia dell’arte. A livello grafico non c’è molto da dire, perché gran parte del lavoro è celato dietro alle stesse opere che hanno reso Leonardo Da Vinci uno degli artisti più noti e apprezzati a livello mondiale. Il giocatore potrà scoprire questo mondo affascinante in punta di piedi, entrando in questa sorta di mostra digitale. I rulli sono dentro la cornice di un quadro d’oro, dove si alternano Smeraldi, Rubini e alcune tra le più belle opere mai fatte.

Tieni gli occhi puntati sulla Gioconda, che è capace di pagare 500 volte la scommessa effettuate se riesci a trovare 5 simboli di fila. Molto interessante è la funzione Tumbling Reel: quando ottieni dei simboli vincenti, questi si dissolvono per lasciare posto a nuove immagini che cadranno dal cielo. E’ così che potrai garantirti un continuo ricambio di simboli di gioco e la possibilità di aumentare le chance di realizzare una nuova combo vincente.

With Da Vinci Ways, you won't just be dealing with true works of art by the great artist, but you'll be facing one of his world-renowned signature works: the Mona Lisa. Unleash your artistic senses and discover all that this online machine has to offer, created by High 5 Games. It will be like taking a journey through the Italy of the Renaissance, even while facing innovative functions that are emblematic of modern gaming. And so, on the five reels, you can enjoy finding 243 ways to win, admiring the most beautiful works ever created by the Italian painter and genius.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nIt's not every day that an online slot game can come to life based on a culture and art history theme. Graphically, there isn't much to say, because much of the work is hidden behind the same works that have made Leonardo da Vinci one of the most well-known and appreciated artists worldwide. The player can discover this fascinating world on tiptoe, entering into this sort of digital exhibit. The reels are inside a golden frame, where emeralds, rubies, and some of the most beautiful works ever made alternate. The symbols of greatest value are therefore the Mona Lisa, the Musician's Portrait, the Virgin of the Rocks, but there are many other surprises to mention. All this will be at your complete disposal from tablets, mobile devices, and desktops without having to organize a visit to the Louvre or the National Gallery.\n\nThe slot game, which has medium volatility, offers maximum winnings starting from winning combinations consisting of at least three symbols. It is soon said that works of art have the highest value, while gems are those that will pay out the least during the entire gameplay. Keep your eyes on the Mona Lisa, which can pay out 500 times the bet placed if you can find five symbols in a row. The Tumbling Reel function is very interesting: when you get winning symbols, they dissolve to make way for new images that will fall from the sky. That's how you can ensure a continuous exchange of game symbols and the possibility of increasing your chances of making a new winning combination. The Scatter allows you to get Free Spins and is the only symbol that cannot be replaced by the Wild, a useful ally for creating wins on the reels more easily.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Da Vinci Ways slot game\nTrying out this online slot machine was a fun experience because it allows you to enter a world that is quite surprising and new for the world of online gambling. The theme is charming, and even though it doesn't feature any particular animations, it has been developed and enriched to the max, thanks to the extra features.

With Da Vinci Ways, not only will you be dealing with the true works of art of the great artist, but you will also be facing one of his famous signatures known all over the world: the Mona Lisa. Free your artistic sense and discover all that this online machine has to offer, created by High 5 Games. It will be like traveling back to Renaissance Italy, even though you'll be dealing with innovative features that are the emblem of modern gaming. And so, on the five reels, you can have fun finding 243 ways to win while admiring the most beautiful works ever made by the Italian painter and genius.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nIt's not every day that a slot game comes to life starting from the theme of culture and art history. As for the graphics, there's not much to say, because most of the work is hidden behind the same works that made Leonardo Da Vinci one of the most well-known and appreciated artists worldwide. The player will be able to discover this fascinating world gently, entering this sort of digital exhibition. The reels are inside the frame of a golden painting, where Emeralds, Rubies, and some of the most beautiful works ever made alternate. The most valuable symbols are therefore the Mona Lisa, the Portrait of a Musician, and the Virgin of the Rocks, but there are many other surprises to mention. All of this will be at your complete disposal from your tablet, mobile devices, and desktop without having to organize a visit to the Louvre or the National Gallery.\n\nThe slot, which has average volatility, gives maximum winnings starting from winning combinations composed of at least three symbols. It's easy to say that works of art have the highest value, while gems are the ones that pay the least throughout the gameplay. Keep your eyes on the Mona Lisa, which is capable of paying 500 times the bet placed if you manage to find 5 symbols in a row. Very interesting is the Tumbling Reel feature: when you get winning symbols, they dissolve to make way for new images that will fall from the sky. This is how you can guarantee a continuous turnover of game symbols and the possibility of increasing the chances of realizing a new winning combo. The Scatter allows you to get Free Spins, and it's the only symbol that cannot be replaced by the Wild, a helpful ally in creating wins on the reels more easily.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Da Vinci Ways slot\nTrying out this online slot machine was a fun experience because it allows you to enter a world that is quite surprising and new to the online gambling world. The theme is pleasant, and even though it doesn't include particular animations, it has been developed and enriched to the fullest, thanks to the extra features. In short, this could be the right time to discover Da Vinci up close.\n            ",

This five-reel slot game not only offers you 243 ways to win, but also allows you to bask in the beauty of Leonardo da Vinci's masterpieces. Talk about having your cake and eating it too. </p>\n\n <p>A unique feature of Da Vinci Ways is the Tumbling Reel function, where winning symbols are replaced rather than spun - because let's be real, Da Vinci would have found spinning boring. Plus, you get to see his world-renowned work again and again. If only he had known his paintings would be used for a slot game, he would have probably fainted. </p>\n\n <p>The Mona Lisa is the highest paying symbol in the game, which is not surprising since she's a lady who knows how to make an entrance. And if you want to trigger Free Spins, keep an eye out for the Scatter symbol. It's like finding a hidden treasure in the middle of a masterpiece. </p>\n\n <p>To add more to the excitement, Da Vinci Ways also features a Wild symbol, which can help create winning combinations and give you a chance to unleash your inner genius. With an average volatility, this game is perfect for anyone who wants to take a break from the serious world of math and science and enjoy the light-hearted fun of a slot game. </p>\"\n}"

With average volatility, payouts are triggered by winning combinations of at least three symbols. The Tumbling Reel feature allows players to replace winning symbols with new ones, increasing the chances of triggering new winning combos. The Scatter symbol can unlock free spins, and the Wild symbol helps players create winning combos more easily.\n\nSymbols and Payouts\n\nThe symbols in Da Vinci Ways reflect the game's artistic theme, featuring some of Leonardo Da Vinci's most famous works, as well as gems. The most valuable symbols are the Mona Lisa, the Portrait of a Musician, and the Virgin of the Rocks, paying out the most throughout the gameplay. The Mona Lisa is the highest-paying symbol and can payout up to 500 times the bet if players manage to find five symbols in a row.

With Da Vinci Ways, not only will you be dealing with the true works of art of the great artist, but you will also be facing one of his famous signatures known all over the world: the Mona Lisa. Free your artistic sense and discover all that this online machine has to offer, created by High 5 Games. It will be like traveling back to Renaissance Italy, even though you'll be dealing with innovative features that are the emblem of modern gaming. And so, on the five reels, you can have fun finding 243 ways to win while admiring the most beautiful works ever made by the Italian painter and genius.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nIt's not every day that a slot game comes to life starting from the theme of culture and art history. As for the graphics, there's not much to say, because most of the work is hidden behind the same works that made Leonardo Da Vinci one of the most well-known and appreciated artists worldwide. The player will be able to discover this fascinating world gently, entering this sort of digital exhibition. The reels are inside the frame of a golden painting, where Emeralds, Rubies, and some of the most beautiful works ever made alternate. The most valuable symbols are therefore the Mona Lisa, the Portrait of a Musician, and the Virgin of the Rocks, but there are many other surprises to mention. All of this will be at your complete disposal from your tablet, mobile devices, and desktop without having to organize a visit to the Louvre or the National Gallery.\n\nThe slot, which has average volatility, gives maximum winnings starting from winning combinations composed of at least three symbols. It's easy to say that works of art have the highest value, while gems are the ones that pay the least throughout the gameplay. Keep your eyes on the Mona Lisa, which is capable of paying 500 times the bet placed if you manage to find 5 symbols in a row. Very interesting is the Tumbling Reel feature: when you get winning symbols, they dissolve to make way for new images that will fall from the sky. This is how you can guarantee a continuous turnover of game symbols and the possibility of increasing the chances of realizing a new winning combo. The Scatter allows you to get Free Spins, and it's the only symbol that cannot be replaced by the Wild, a helpful ally in creating wins on the reels more easily.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Da Vinci Ways slot\nTrying out this online slot machine was a fun experience because it allows you to enter a world that is quite surprising and new to the online gambling world. The theme is pleasant, and even though it doesn't include particular animations, it has been developed and enriched to the fullest, thanks to the extra features. In short, this could be the right time to discover Da Vinci up close.\n            ",

With Da Vinci Ways, not only will you be dealing with the true works of art of the great artist, but you will also be facing one of his famous signatures known all over the world: the Mona Lisa. Free your artistic sense and discover all that this online machine has to offer, created by High 5 Games. It will be like traveling back to Renaissance Italy, even though you'll be dealing with innovative features that are the emblem of modern gaming. And so, on the five reels, you can have fun finding 243 ways to win while admiring the most beautiful works ever made by the Italian painter and genius.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nIt's not every day that a slot game comes to life starting from the theme of culture and art history. As for the graphics, there's not much to say, because most of the work is hidden behind the same works that made Leonardo Da Vinci one of the most well-known and appreciated artists worldwide. The player will be able to discover this fascinating world gently, entering this sort of digital exhibition. The reels are inside the frame of a golden painting, where Emeralds, Rubies, and some of the most beautiful works ever made alternate. The most valuable symbols are therefore the Mona Lisa, the Portrait of a Musician, and the Virgin of the Rocks, but there are many other surprises to mention. All of this will be at your complete disposal from your tablet, mobile devices, and desktop without having to organize a visit to the Louvre or the National Gallery.\n\nThe slot, which has average volatility, gives maximum winnings starting from winning combinations composed of at least three symbols. It's easy to say that works of art have the highest value, while gems are the ones that pay the least throughout the gameplay. Keep your eyes on the Mona Lisa, which is capable of paying 500 times the bet placed if you manage to find 5 symbols in a row. Very interesting is the Tumbling Reel feature: when you get winning symbols, they dissolve to make way for new images that will fall from the sky. This is how you can guarantee a continuous turnover of game symbols and the possibility of increasing the chances of realizing a new winning combo. The Scatter allows you to get Free Spins, and it's the only symbol that cannot be replaced by the Wild, a helpful ally in creating wins on the reels more easily.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Da Vinci Ways slot\nTrying out this online slot machine was a fun experience because it allows you to enter a world that is quite surprising and new to the online gambling world. The theme is pleasant, and even though it doesn't include particular animations, it has been developed and enriched to the fullest, thanks to the extra features. In short, this could be the right time to discover Da Vinci up close.\n        ",
