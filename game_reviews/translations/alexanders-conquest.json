Set during the height of a military campaign, with the base camp set up and soldiers advancing towards the enemy, led by the great Alexander the Great, a charismatic figure who has become legendary for his countless exploits. This is the setting of Alexander's Conquest, a stunning slot from High 5 Games. The game grid is an open parchment, although the interior is not a sheet, but rather the battlefield upon which armies are moving, which we will explain in a dedicated paragraph on the game's functionality. As is traditional with this provider, the graphics are a strong point, although the large number of symbols that can be accommodated on the grid is at the expense of the icons' size, which are a bit on the small side for our tastes.\n\nThe sound components, a mix of knightly music and the sounds of horse hooves and armor, create a beautiful atmosphere of epic adventure.\n\nFeatures of Alexander's Conquest\n\nWith this slot, High 5 Games has overturned classic rules by proposing a mobile grid that changes based on the symbols that land on the reels. We start with 6 reels and 4 rows, but the latter can reach up to 10. The minimum bet is 20 virtual coins, bearing in mind that we are playing with the Demo version found on our site. Ways to win are always indicated in a counter at the top of the grid, ranging from 4,096x the bet to a maximum of 1,000,000x! To win, it is necessary to form combinations of identical symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the first on the left.\n\nThere are two main functions: Autoplay, which allows you to decide on a number of automatic spins between 10 and 80, and a turbo function, which speeds up the falling of the symbols.\n\nThe volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player is 96%.\n\nAn innovative game\n\nThe goal of the game is, of course, to form combinations of identical symbols, but also to reach the upper and lower extremities of the battlefield. Regular symbols are soldiers and effigies, which pay out with a number of symbols ranging from 3 to 6.\n\nThe Wild substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, but to obtain it, the reel must expand to touch one of the stones on the lower or upper frame of the grid. However, for the reel to expand, the symbol of the arrow pointing up or down must appear. Each of these symbols is associated with a number, 1, 2, or 3, which corresponds to the number of positions the reel will occupy in its advance. The Wild remains fixed for the next Spin, after which the reel returns to its original position.\n\nThe \"Bonus\" and \"Bonus Wild\" symbols are our Scatters. The first awards Free Spins, the second also replaces symbols to form a combo before the free spins begin.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan you play Alexander's Conquest with real money?\n\nCertainly, the slot is regularly featured in the best online casinos, and it will be possible to bet with real money.\n\nDoes it offer special features?\n\nYes, in addition to the expandable reels that increase the paylines, it also features free spins from a minimum of 18 to a maximum of 25 spins.\n\nWhat is its RTP?\n\nThe RTP is 96%, and the volatility is high, meaning that wins will come less often, but if you're lucky, you could win big.",

As is traditional with this provider, the graphics are a strong point, although the large number of symbols that can be accommodated on the grid is at the expense of the icons' size, which are a bit on the small side for our tastes.\n\nThe sound components, a mix of knightly music and the sounds of horse hooves and armor, create a beautiful atmosphere of epic adventure.\n\nFeatures of Alexander's Conquest\n\nWith this slot, High 5 Games has overturned classic rules by proposing a mobile grid that changes based on the symbols that land on the reels. We start with 6 reels and 4 rows, but the latter can reach up to 10. The minimum bet is 20 virtual coins, bearing in mind that we are playing with the Demo version found on our site. Ways to win are always indicated in a counter at the top of the grid, ranging from 4,096x the bet to a maximum of 1,000,000x! To win, it is necessary to form combinations of identical symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the first on the left.\n\nThere are two main functions: Autoplay, which allows you to decide on a number of automatic spins between 10 and 80, and a turbo function, which speeds up the falling of the symbols.\n\nThe volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player is 96%.\n\nAn innovative game\n\nThe goal of the game is, of course, to form combinations of identical symbols, but also to reach the upper and lower extremities of the battlefield. Regular symbols are soldiers and effigies, which pay out with a number of symbols ranging from 3 to 6.\n\nThe Wild substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, but to obtain it, the reel must expand to touch one of the stones on the lower or upper frame of the grid. However, for the reel to expand, the symbol of the arrow pointing up or down must appear. Each of these symbols is associated with a number, 1, 2, or 3, which corresponds to the number of positions the reel will occupy in its advance. The Wild remains fixed for the next Spin, after which the reel returns to its original position.\n\nThe \"Bonus\" and \"Bonus Wild\" symbols are our Scatters. The first awards Free Spins, the second also replaces symbols to form a combo before the free spins begin.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan you play Alexander's Conquest with real money?\n\nCertainly, the slot is regularly featured in the best online casinos, and it will be possible to bet with real money.\n\nDoes it offer special features?\n\nYes, in addition to the expandable reels that increase the paylines, it also features free spins from a minimum of 18 to a maximum of 25 spins.\n\nWhat is its RTP?\n\nThe RTP is 96%, and the volatility is high, meaning that wins will come less often, but if you're lucky, you could win big.\n        ",

As is traditional with this provider, the graphics are a strong point, although the large number of symbols that can be accommodated on the grid is at the expense of the icons' size, which are a bit on the small side for our tastes.\n\nThe sound components, a mix of knightly music and the sounds of horse hooves and armor, create a beautiful atmosphere of epic adventure.\n\nFeatures of Alexander's Conquest\n\nWith this slot, High 5 Games has overturned classic rules by proposing a mobile grid that changes based on the symbols that land on the reels. We start with 6 reels and 4 rows, but the latter can reach up to 10. The minimum bet is 20 virtual coins, bearing in mind that we are playing with the Demo version found on our site. Ways to win are always indicated in a counter at the top of the grid, ranging from 4,096x the bet to a maximum of 1,000,000x! To win, it is necessary to form combinations of identical symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the first on the left.\n\nThere are two main functions: Autoplay, which allows you to decide on a number of automatic spins between 10 and 80, and a turbo function, which speeds up the falling of the symbols.\n\nThe volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player is 96%.\n\nAn innovative game\n\nThe goal of the game is, of course, to form combinations of identical symbols, but also to reach the upper and lower extremities of the battlefield. Regular symbols are soldiers and effigies, which pay out with a number of symbols ranging from 3 to 6.\n\nThe Wild substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, but to obtain it, the reel must expand to touch one of the stones on the lower or upper frame of the grid. However, for the reel to expand, the symbol of the arrow pointing up or down must appear. Each of these symbols is associated with a number, 1, 2, or 3, which corresponds to the number of positions the reel will occupy in its advance. The Wild remains fixed for the next Spin, after which the reel returns to its original position.\n\nThe \"Bonus\" and \"Bonus Wild\" symbols are our Scatters. The first awards Free Spins, the second also replaces symbols to form a combo before the free spins begin.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan you play Alexander's Conquest with real money?\n\nCertainly, the slot is regularly featured in the best online casinos, and it will be possible to bet with real money.\n\nDoes it offer special features?\n\nYes, in addition to the expandable reels that increase the paylines, it also features free spins from a minimum of 18 to a maximum of 25 spins.\n\nWhat is its RTP?\n\nThe RTP is 96%, and the volatility is high, meaning that wins will come less often, but if you're lucky, you could win big.\n            ",

Set during the height of a military campaign, with the base camp set up and soldiers advancing towards the enemy, led by the great Alexander the Great, a charismatic figure who has become legendary for his countless exploits. This is the setting of Alexander's Conquest, a stunning slot from High 5 Games. The game grid is an open parchment, although the interior is not a sheet, but rather the battlefield upon which armies are moving, which we will explain in a dedicated paragraph on the game's functionality. As is traditional with this provider, the graphics are a strong point, although the large number of symbols that can be accommodated on the grid is at the expense of the icons' size, which are a bit on the small side for our tastes.\n\nThe sound components, a mix of knightly music and the sounds of horse hooves and armor, create a beautiful atmosphere of epic adventure.\n\nFeatures of Alexander's Conquest\n\nWith this slot, High 5 Games has overturned classic rules by proposing a mobile grid that changes based on the symbols that land on the reels. We start with 6 reels and 4 rows, but the latter can reach up to 10. The minimum bet is 20 virtual coins, bearing in mind that we are playing with the Demo version found on our site. Ways to win are always indicated in a counter at the top of the grid, ranging from 4,096x the bet to a maximum of 1,000,000x! To win, it is necessary to form combinations of identical symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the first on the left.\n\nThere are two main functions: Autoplay, which allows you to decide on a number of automatic spins between 10 and 80, and a turbo function, which speeds up the falling of the symbols.\n\nThe volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player is 96%.\n\nAn innovative game\n\nThe goal of the game is, of course, to form combinations of identical symbols, but also to reach the upper and lower extremities of the battlefield. Regular symbols are soldiers and effigies, which pay out with a number of symbols ranging from 3 to 6.\n\nThe Wild substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, but to obtain it, the reel must expand to touch one of the stones on the lower or upper frame of the grid. However, for the reel to expand, the symbol of the arrow pointing up or down must appear. Each of these symbols is associated with a number, 1, 2, or 3, which corresponds to the number of positions the reel will occupy in its advance. The Wild remains fixed for the next Spin, after which the reel returns to its original position.\n\nThe \"Bonus\" and \"Bonus Wild\" symbols are our Scatters. The first awards Free Spins, the second also replaces symbols to form a combo before the free spins begin.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan you play Alexander's Conquest with real money?\n\nCertainly, the slot is regularly featured in the best online casinos, and it will be possible to bet with real money.\n\nDoes it offer special features?\n\nYes, in addition to the expandable reels that increase the paylines, it also features free spins from a minimum of 18 to a maximum of 25 spins.\n\nWhat is its RTP?\n\nThe RTP is 96%, and the volatility is high, meaning that wins will come less often, but if you're lucky, you could win big.\n            ",

Set during the height of a military campaign, with the base camp set up and soldiers advancing towards the enemy, led by the great Alexander the Great, a charismatic figure who has become legendary for his countless exploits. This is the setting of Alexander's Conquest, a stunning slot from High 5 Games. The game grid is an open parchment, although the interior is not a sheet, but rather the battlefield upon which armies are moving, which we will explain in a dedicated paragraph on the game's functionality. As is traditional with this provider, the graphics are a strong point, although the large number of symbols that can be accommodated on the grid is at the expense of the icons' size, which are a bit on the small side for our tastes.\n\nThe sound components, a mix of knightly music and the sounds of horse hooves and armor, create a beautiful atmosphere of epic adventure.\n\nFeatures of Alexander's Conquest\n\nWith this slot, High 5 Games has overturned classic rules by proposing a mobile grid that changes based on the symbols that land on the reels. We start with 6 reels and 4 rows, but the latter can reach up to 10. The minimum bet is 20 virtual coins, bearing in mind that we are playing with the Demo version found on our site. Ways to win are always indicated in a counter at the top of the grid, ranging from 4,096x the bet to a maximum of 1,000,000x! To win, it is necessary to form combinations of identical symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the first on the left.\n\nThere are two main functions: Autoplay, which allows you to decide on a number of automatic spins between 10 and 80, and a turbo function, which speeds up the falling of the symbols.\n\nThe volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player is 96%.\n\nAn innovative game\n\nThe goal of the game is, of course, to form combinations of identical symbols, but also to reach the upper and lower extremities of the battlefield. Regular symbols are soldiers and effigies, which pay out with a number of symbols ranging from 3 to 6.\n\nThe Wild substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, but to obtain it, the reel must expand to touch one of the stones on the lower or upper frame of the grid. However, for the reel to expand, the symbol of the arrow pointing up or down must appear. Each of these symbols is associated with a number, 1, 2, or 3, which corresponds to the number of positions the reel will occupy in its advance. The Wild remains fixed for the next Spin, after which the reel returns to its original position.\n\nThe \"Bonus\" and \"Bonus Wild\" symbols are our Scatters. The first awards Free Spins, the second also replaces symbols to form a combo before the free spins begin.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan you play Alexander's Conquest with real money?\n\nCertainly, the slot is regularly featured in the best online casinos, and it will be possible to bet with real money.\n\nDoes it offer special features?\n\nYes, in addition to the expandable reels that increase the paylines, it also features free spins from a minimum of 18 to a maximum of 25 spins.\n\nWhat is its RTP?\n\nThe RTP is 96%, and the volatility is high, meaning that wins will come less often, but if you're lucky, you could win big.\n            ",
