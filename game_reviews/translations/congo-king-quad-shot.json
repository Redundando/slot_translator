However, she must first face off against a massive gorilla who despises human contact. With pinpoint graphics, \"Congo King Quad Shot\" delivers an adrenaline-pumping gameplay experience as players immerse themselves in the lush, rainy jungle setting, accompanied by a captivating soundtrack and exciting sound effects associated with victories. The game features 100 variable pay lines arranged on a 5x3 grid, with a bet of €4 for all 100 lines active and the option of up to 100 auto-spins.

The gorilla symbol serves as the game's wild symbol, being able to expand and substituting for all symbols except the special ones.

The Quad symbol, a frame that appears around a symbol, is linked to winning one of the game's jackpots. To win the Mini jackpot, players must land a winning combination with at least one substitute symbol and a Quad symbol using five of the royal symbols. Winning the Minor jackpot requires the same conditions, but with the game's high-value symbols. The Maxi jackpot is won when a player lands five of the royal symbols with a Quad symbol, even if there are no substitute symbols. Finally, the Major jackpot is won when the same condition is met using high-value symbols instead.
