Ulteriori giri possono essere attivati atterrando più simboli di Scatter mentre si gioca in modalità Giri liberi.\nAngel’s Touch fornisce 40 linee di scommessa fisse e si può cliccare lungo la parte inferiore dello schermo per scegliere 1, 2, 3, 4 o 5 crediti per linea. I valori delle monete vanno da 0,01 a 0,50. L’importo massimo che si può scommettere per giro è di 125,00 mentre il minimo su un dato giro è di 0,50.\nCon bobine a rotazione rapida ed effetti sonori minimi, Angel’s Touch è un gioco facile da giocare. Il pannello di controllo è un po’ complicato, con più pulsanti di quelli che i Lightning Box Games di solito includono, ma ognuno è chiaramente etichettato e non ci vuole molto per capire come modificare le impostazioni a proprio piacimento. L’autoplay è disponibile per coloro che preferiscono girare senza sforzo più volte a livello di scommessa. Scegliete di farla giocare ovunque da 5 a 100 giri per vostro conto.\nAngel’s Touch è completamente compatibile con i sistemi operativi Windows, Mac e Linux su laptop e computer.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nVi consigliamo di dare un’occhiata anche a Dante’s Paradise HD Slot Machine Online dove, nei panni di Dante Alighieri, potrete tentare la fortuna con 5 bobine e 25 linee di pagamento. Qui, il Wild è rappresentato dal jolly e, oltre ai giri gratis, i giocatori potranno decidere tra strade diverse da intraprendere.\n\n        ",

Firstly, you'll need to match at least three angel symbols. Instead of triggering a free spins bonus, however, this will activate the angel's Touch Bonus.\n\nYou'll then be taken to a screen with lots of fluffy-looking clouds - this is a choice bonus game where you'll choose from one of the eight clouds displayed. Under these clouds, you'll find multipliers and symbols that can be activated in free games. The 2, 3, and 5 multipliers can be revealed and a maximum multiplier of 20 can be activated during free spins.\n\nDuring our review of Angel's Touch Slots, we also managed to choose a bell and a harp symbol - which are divine choices. If these two symbols are revealed, they will become wilder during free spins. There's also a devil symbol, but you'll want to avoid it at all costs; revealing two devil symbols during the pick bonus will end the bonus!\n\nOnce free spins have been activated, there's the chance to tap into even more free games for even more angelic fun - just land bonus symbols again to uncover your new rewards!\n\nCelestial Graphics\n\nAll heavenly things are present here in Angel's Touch. From the celestial opening music to the background with blue skies, white clouds, and golden gates, the retro-cartoonish artwork and harp and bell sound effects fit perfectly with the theme.\n\nThe lower value symbols are the typical 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A playing card varieties. They appear in different sparkling colors, each with a golden aura or two, while the higher value symbols are well detailed.\n\nThe highest value symbol is a silver bell adorned with a red ribbon. Then there's a pearly angel harp, and a silver trumpet completes the symbols that you want to see appear more often on the reels. A soft xylophone plays when you click “spin” and winning combinations are announced with a jazz trumpet melody, a chorus of bells ringing, or a softer melody played by the harp.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nA pair of golden angel wings shaped like a halo make up the standard wild in this game. It substitutes for all symbols except the scatter and appears often enough to help make winning combinations. The scatter features a slightly daring angel in retro swimsuit, kicking back against his wings with his floating aura above his head. Landing on three, four, or five scatters will take you to free spins mode, via the angel's touch bonus game described below.\n\nAdditionally, you can increase your chances of triggering the bonus feature at any time by clicking on the round “Play Feature +10” button located in the center of the screen beneath the reels. This will cost you extra credits, but it could pay off when you find yourself landing on the bonus game more frequently. Note that the bonus button remains active for consecutive spins unless you click it again to turn it off.\n\nAngel's Touch's bonus game starts when you land on 3, 4, or 5 angelic scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. An eight-cloud screen appears and you click on them one by one to reveal increasing multipliers of up to 20 times. You can continue to click on clouds until you land on two devils, at which point your free spins begin with the multiplier you earned by clicking on the clouds. If you happen to land on a bell or harp under the clouds, they go wild for the duration of your free spins. Additional spins can be activated by landing more scatter symbols while playing in free spins mode.\n\nAngel's Touch provides 40 fixed betting lines and you can click along the bottom of the screen to choose 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 credits per line. Coin values range from 0.01 to 0.50. The maximum amount that can be bet per spin is $125.00 while the minimum on any given spin is $0.50.\n\nWith fast-spinning reels and minimal sound effects, Angel's Touch is an easy game to play. The control panel is a bit complicated, with more buttons than Lightning Box Games usually includes, but each is clearly labeled and it doesn't take much to figure out how to adjust the settings to your liking. Autoplay is available for those who prefer to effortlessly spin numerous times at their preferred bet level. Choose to have it play anywhere from 5 to 100 spins on your behalf.\n\nAngel's Touch is fully compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems on laptops and computers.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nWe also recommend checking out Dante's Paradise HD Slot Machine Online where, in the guise of Dante Alighieri, you can try your luck with 5 reels and 25 paylines. Here, the wild is represented by the joker and, in addition to free spins, players can choose between different paths to take."

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nBonus feature\nGame theme\nSymbols\nWild and Scatter symbols\nBonus frequency\nBetting options\nGameplay\nMaximum and minimum bet\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Angel's Touch\nWith intricately chosen features, the slot game Angel's Touch embodies the mantra \"less is more\" with only one notable bonus feature, but several rewards can be obtained from activating the bonus. First of all, you need to match at least three angel symbols. Instead of activating a bonus for free spins, however, this will activate the Angel's Touch bonus. \n\nYou will then be taken to a screen with a lot of fluffy-looking clouds; this is a bonus choice game where you can choose one of the eight displayed clouds. Under these clouds, you will find multipliers and symbols that can be activated during free games. The multipliers 2, 3, and 5 can be revealed, and a maximum multiplier of 20 can be activated during free spins. \n\nDuring our review of Angel's Touch slots, we were also able to choose a bell and a harp symbol - which are divine choices. If these two symbols are revealed, they will become even wilder during free spins. There is also a devil symbol, but you'll want to avoid it at all costs; revealing two devil symbols during the pick bonus will end the bonus! \n\nOnce free spins have been activated, there is a chance to further recover free games for even more angelic fun - just land the bonus symbols again to discover your new rewards! \n\nA celestial graphic\nAll heavenly things are present here in Angel's Touch. From the celestial opening music to the background with blue skies, white clouds, and golden gates, the retro-cartoonish-style artwork and the sound effects of harps and bells fit perfectly with the theme. \n\nThe lower value symbols are the typical varieties of playing cards 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A. They appear in different sparkling colors, each with a golden halo or two, while the higher value symbols are well-detailed. \n\nThe highest value symbol is a silver bell adorned with a red ribbon. Then there is a pearly white angel harp, and a silver trumpet completes the symbols you want to see appear more often on the reels. A soft xylophone plays when you click \"spin,\" and winning combinations are announced with a jazz trumpet melody, a round of bells ringing, or a softer melody played by the harp. \n\nFunctions and Symbols of Slot Machine\nA couple of gold angel wings in the shape of a halo make up the standard Wild in this game. It replaces all symbols except the Scatter and appears often enough to help make winning combinations. The Scatter features a slightly daring angel in a retro-style swimsuit, kicking back against its wings with its hovering halo above its head. Landing on three, four, or five Scatters will lead you to free spins mode, through the angel's touch bonus game described below. \n\nAdditionally, you can increase your chances of activating the bonus feature at any time by clicking on the round \"Play Feature +10\" button located in the middle of the screen below the reels. This will cost you extra credits, but it could pay off when you find yourself landing on the Bonus Game more frequently. Note that the bonus button remains active for consecutive spins unless you click it again to turn it off. \n\nAngel's Touch bonus game begins when you land on 3, 4, or 5 angelic Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. An eight-cloud screen appears, and you click on them one by one to reveal increasing multipliers up to 20 times. You can continue clicking on the clouds until you land on two devils, at which point your free spins begin with the multiplier you earned by clicking on the clouds. If you happen to land on a bell or harp under the clouds, they will unleash throughout the duration of your free spins. Further spins can be activated by landing more Scatter symbols while playing in Free Spins mode. \n\nAngel's Touch provides 40 fixed bet lines, and you can click along the bottom of the screen to choose 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 credits per line. Coin values range from 0.01 to 0.50. The maximum amount that can be wagered per spin is 125.00 while the minimum on a given spin is 0.50. \n\nWith fast-spinning reels and minimal sound effects, Angel's Touch is an easy game to play. The control panel is a bit complicated, with more buttons than Lightning Box Games usually include, but each is clearly labeled, and it doesn't take much to figure out how to adjust the settings to your liking. Autoplay is available for those who prefer to spin effortlessly multiple times at the betting level. Choose to have it play anywhere from 5 to 100 spins on your behalf. \n\nAngel's Touch is fully compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems on laptops and computers. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nWe also recommend checking out Dante's Paradise HD Slot Machine Online where, in the guise of Dante Alighieri, you can test your luck with 5 reels and 25 pay lines. Here, the Wild is represented by the wild card, and in addition to free spins, players can choose from different paths to take.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\nAngel's Touch is a simple and straightforward slot game that is easy to understand and play. The game offers 40 fixed bet lines, and players can choose from a range of coin values ranging from 0.01 to 0.50. The maximum amount that can be wagered per spin is 125.00 while the minimum on a given spin is 0.50.\n\nBonus Feature\n\nThe game offers a unique bonus feature called Angel's Touch. To activate the bonus feature, players need to match at least three angel symbols. The bonus feature is a pick game where players get to choose one of the eight displayed clouds. The clouds reveal multipliers and symbols that can be activated during free games. The multipliers 2, 3, and 5 can be revealed, and a maximum multiplier of 20 can be activated during free spins. Additionally, players can increase their chances of activating the bonus feature by clicking on the round 'Play Feature +10' button located in the middle of the screen below the reels. This will cost players extra credits, but it could pay off when they find themselves landing on the bonus game more frequently.\n\nTheme\n\nAngel's Touch is a celestial-themed slot game that embodies the essence of heavenly being. The game features a celestial opening music with a blue sky, white clouds, and golden gates in the background. The retro-cartoonish-style artwork and sound effects of harps and bells fit perfectly with the theme.\n\nSymbols\n\nAngel's Touch features a range of symbols that fit perfectly with the game's celestial theme. The lower value symbols are the typical varieties of playing cards 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A. They appear in different sparkling colors, each with a golden halo or two, while the higher value symbols are well-detailed. The highest value symbol is a silver bell adorned with a red ribbon. Then there is a pearly white angel harp, and a silver trumpet completes the symbols players want to see appear more often on the reels.\n\nWild Symbol\n\nThe standard Wild in Angel's Touch is a couple of gold angel wings in the shape of a halo. It replaces all symbols except the Scatter and appears often enough to help make winning combinations.\n\nScatter Symbol\n\nThe Scatter in Angel's Touch features a slightly daring angel in a retro-style swimsuit, kicking back against its wings with its hovering halo above its head. Landing on three, four, or five Scatters will lead players to free spins mode, through the Angel's Touch bonus game.\n\nBet Lines\n\nAngel's Touch provides 40 fixed bet lines, and players can click along the bottom of the screen to choose 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 credits per line. Coin values range from 0.01 to 0.50.\n\nBetting Options\n\nThe maximum amount that can be wagered per spin in Angel's Touch is 125.00 while the minimum on a given spin is 0.50. Autoplay is available for those who prefer to spin effortlessly multiple times at the betting level. Players can choose to have it play anywhere from 5 to 100 spins on their behalf. Angel's Touch is fully compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems on laptops and computers.\n\n        \n            ",

First of all, you need to match at least three angel symbols. Instead of activating a bonus for free spins, however, this will activate the Angel's Touch bonus. \n\nYou will then be taken to a screen with a lot of fluffy-looking clouds; this is a bonus choice game where you can choose one of the eight displayed clouds. Under these clouds, you will find multipliers and symbols that can be activated during free games. The multipliers 2, 3, and 5 can be revealed, and a maximum multiplier of 20 can be activated during free spins. \n\nDuring our review of Angel's Touch slots, we were also able to choose a bell and a harp symbol - which are divine choices. If these two symbols are revealed, they will become even wilder during free spins. There is also a devil symbol, but you'll want to avoid it at all costs; revealing two devil symbols during the pick bonus will end the bonus! \n\nOnce free spins have been activated, there is a chance to further recover free games for even more angelic fun - just land the bonus symbols again to discover your new rewards! \n\nA celestial graphic\nAll heavenly things are present here in Angel's Touch. From the celestial opening music to the background with blue skies, white clouds, and golden gates, the retro-cartoonish-style artwork and the sound effects of harps and bells fit perfectly with the theme. \n\nThe lower value symbols are the typical varieties of playing cards 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A. They appear in different sparkling colors, each with a golden halo or two, while the higher value symbols are well-detailed. \n\nThe highest value symbol is a silver bell adorned with a red ribbon. Then there is a pearly white angel harp, and a silver trumpet completes the symbols you want to see appear more often on the reels. A soft xylophone plays when you click \"spin,\" and winning combinations are announced with a jazz trumpet melody, a round of bells ringing, or a softer melody played by the harp. \n\nFunctions and Symbols of Slot Machine\nA couple of gold angel wings in the shape of a halo make up the standard Wild in this game. It replaces all symbols except the Scatter and appears often enough to help make winning combinations. The Scatter features a slightly daring angel in a retro-style swimsuit, kicking back against its wings with its hovering halo above its head. Landing on three, four, or five Scatters will lead you to free spins mode, through the angel's touch bonus game described below. \n\nAdditionally, you can increase your chances of activating the bonus feature at any time by clicking on the round \"Play Feature +10\" button located in the middle of the screen below the reels. This will cost you extra credits, but it could pay off when you find yourself landing on the Bonus Game more frequently. Note that the bonus button remains active for consecutive spins unless you click it again to turn it off. \n\nAngel's Touch bonus game begins when you land on 3, 4, or 5 angelic Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. An eight-cloud screen appears, and you click on them one by one to reveal increasing multipliers up to 20 times. You can continue clicking on the clouds until you land on two devils, at which point your free spins begin with the multiplier you earned by clicking on the clouds. If you happen to land on a bell or harp under the clouds, they will unleash throughout the duration of your free spins. Further spins can be activated by landing more Scatter symbols while playing in Free Spins mode. \n\nAngel's Touch provides 40 fixed bet lines, and you can click along the bottom of the screen to choose 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 credits per line. Coin values range from 0.01 to 0.50. The maximum amount that can be wagered per spin is 125.00 while the minimum on a given spin is 0.50. \n\nWith fast-spinning reels and minimal sound effects, Angel's Touch is an easy game to play. The control panel is a bit complicated, with more buttons than Lightning Box Games usually include, but each is clearly labeled, and it doesn't take much to figure out how to adjust the settings to your liking. Autoplay is available for those who prefer to spin effortlessly multiple times at the betting level. Choose to have it play anywhere from 5 to 100 spins on your behalf. \n\nAngel's Touch is fully compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems on laptops and computers. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nWe also recommend checking out Dante's Paradise HD Slot Machine Online where, in the guise of Dante Alighieri, you can test your luck with 5 reels and 25 pay lines. Here, the Wild is represented by the wild card, and in addition to free spins, players can choose from different paths to take.\n            ",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a review of the game \"Angel’s Touch\".\n\nPlease provide an FAQ:\n\n- 8 questions\n- Use simple language and provide practical takeaways.\n- Respond with a JSON!\n- Use the key \"faq\" and an array with the keys \"question\" and \"answer\". \n\nReview: Angel's Touch\nWith intricately chosen features, the slot game Angel's Touch embodies the mantra \"less is more\" with only one notable bonus feature, but several rewards can be obtained from activating the bonus. First of all, you need to match at least three angel symbols. Instead of activating a bonus for free spins, however, this will activate the Angel's Touch bonus. \n\nYou will then be taken to a screen with a lot of fluffy-looking clouds; this is a bonus choice game where you can choose one of the eight displayed clouds. Under these clouds, you will find multipliers and symbols that can be activated during free games. The multipliers 2, 3, and 5 can be revealed, and a maximum multiplier of 20 can be activated during free spins. \n\nDuring our review of Angel's Touch slots, we were also able to choose a bell and a harp symbol - which are divine choices. If these two symbols are revealed, they will become even wilder during free spins. There is also a devil symbol, but you'll want to avoid it at all costs; revealing two devil symbols during the pick bonus will end the bonus! \n\nOnce free spins have been activated, there is a chance to further recover free games for even more angelic fun - just land the bonus symbols again to discover your new rewards! \n\nA celestial graphic\nAll heavenly things are present here in Angel's Touch. From the celestial opening music to the background with blue skies, white clouds, and golden gates, the retro-cartoonish-style artwork and the sound effects of harps and bells fit perfectly with the theme. \n\nThe lower value symbols are the typical varieties of playing cards 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A. They appear in different sparkling colors, each with a golden halo or two, while the higher value symbols are well-detailed. \n\nThe highest value symbol is a silver bell adorned with a red ribbon. Then there is a pearly white angel harp, and a silver trumpet completes the symbols you want to see appear more often on the reels. A soft xylophone plays when you click \"spin,\" and winning combinations are announced with a jazz trumpet melody, a round of bells ringing, or a softer melody played by the harp. \n\nFunctions and Symbols of Slot Machine\nA couple of gold angel wings in the shape of a halo make up the standard Wild in this game. It replaces all symbols except the Scatter and appears often enough to help make winning combinations. The Scatter features a slightly daring angel in a retro-style swimsuit, kicking back against its wings with its hovering halo above its head. Landing on three, four, or five Scatters will lead you to free spins mode, through the angel's touch bonus game described below. \n\nAdditionally, you can increase your chances of activating the bonus feature at any time by clicking on the round \"Play Feature +10\" button located in the middle of the screen below the reels. This will cost you extra credits, but it could pay off when you find yourself landing on the Bonus Game more frequently. Note that the bonus button remains active for consecutive spins unless you click it again to turn it off. \n\nAngel's Touch bonus game begins when you land on 3, 4, or 5 angelic Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. An eight-cloud screen appears, and you click on them one by one to reveal increasing multipliers up to 20 times. You can continue clicking on the clouds until you land on two devils, at which point your free spins begin with the multiplier you earned by clicking on the clouds. If you happen to land on a bell or harp under the clouds, they will unleash throughout the duration of your free spins. Further spins can be activated by landing more Scatter symbols while playing in Free Spins mode. \n\nAngel's Touch provides 40 fixed bet lines, and you can click along the bottom of the screen to choose 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 credits per line. Coin values range from 0.01 to 0.50. The maximum amount that can be wagered per spin is 125.00 while the minimum on a given spin is 0.50. \n\nWith fast-spinning reels and minimal sound effects, Angel's Touch is an easy game to play. The control panel is a bit complicated, with more buttons than Lightning Box Games usually include, but each is clearly labeled, and it doesn't take much to figure out how to adjust the settings to your liking. Autoplay is available for those who prefer to spin effortlessly multiple times at the betting level. Choose to have it play anywhere from 5 to 100 spins on your behalf. \n\nAngel's Touch is fully compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems on laptops and computers. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nWe also recommend checking out Dante's Paradise HD Slot Machine Online where, in the guise of Dante Alighieri, you can test your luck with 5 reels and 25 pay lines. Here, the Wild is represented by the wild card, and in addition to free spins, players can choose from different paths to take.\n            ",
