In addition, there are video excerpts of concerts that are shown during bonuses and special wins, making the game even more exciting. And then there is the soundtrack, consisting of five hits, including Welcome to the Jungle, the band's signature song, November Rain, and Paradise City.\n\nSlot features\n\nThe slot features classic gameplay, starting with the size of the grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows. There are 20 fixed paylines, with each spin costing €0.20, with different levels of betting.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame Features and Bonuses\nSymbolism and Imagery\nBetting Options and Paylines\nVolatility and RTP\nSoundtrack and Video Clips\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: \"Guns N' Roses\" - Rock history's greatest classics\n\nWelcome to the Jungle, November Rain, Patience, and It's So Easy are just some of the legendary songs of Guns N' Roses, known and loved around the globe. Founded by Axl Rose, Slash, and Duff, they are considered to be the greatest rock band ever, especially in the live dimension. It's no wonder that the main screen is a big stage with the game grid in the center and the band's logo in the background, with every symbol recalling the iconic imagery created by the group. To make the game even more special, there are video clips of concerts shown during bonus and special wins. And then there's the soundtrack, composed of five hits, including Welcome to the Jungle, the group's manifesto song, November Rain, and Paradise City. \n\nSlot Features \nThe slot embodies classic features, starting with the size of the grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 20 and fixed, with each spin costing 0.20 € and various betting levels available. The bet can be raised as desired, and the Max Bet button allows for the maximum level to be set with just one click. Among the various features is Autoplay, which allows the player to set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins. The volatility is low, with a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.98%. \n\nAppetite for Destruction Feature \nAs previously mentioned, all symbols in Guns N' Roses evoke the band's imagery. While the cards adorned with roses are the lower value symbols, to win high amounts, players will want to focus on the picks of the Use Your Illusion II and Lies albums, not to mention the images of Axl Rose, Slash, and Duff. The real goodies, however, come from the various bonuses, starting with the two Wilds, normal and expanding, which substitute for all symbols except other special ones. \n\nThe vinyl record is our bonus. If at least three land during a spin, an LP will appear on a turntable and, depending on where the needle stops, players can win a special game: \n- Encore Free Spins: activates ten free spins in which the band members become expanding wilds. \n- Crowd Pleaser Bonus Game: a bonus divided into three levels, rewarding players with free spins and coins. \n- Coin Wins: this bonus offers immediate monetary rewards. \nOther extra features include the Appetite for Destruction Wild, a random cross-shaped wildcard that rewards players with sky-high winnings, and the Legend Spin, in which the band members transform into expanding wilds. \n\nFAQs \nIs the RTP of this slot satisfying? \n\nAbsolutely! We're close to 97%, one of the highest percentages you can find! \n\nWhat does it mean that the volatility is low? \n\nIt means that players can win fairly often, but the prizes aren't very high. \n\nCan I play on my mobile devices? \n\nOf course! Guns N' Roses is designed to run smoothly on any device.\n            ",

Founded by Axl Rose, Slash, and Duff, they are considered to be the greatest rock band ever, especially in the live dimension. It's no wonder that the main screen is a big stage with the game grid in the center and the band's logo in the background, with every symbol recalling the iconic imagery created by the group. To make the game even more special, there are video clips of concerts shown during bonus and special wins. And then there's the soundtrack, composed of five hits, including Welcome to the Jungle, the group's manifesto song, November Rain, and Paradise City. \n\nSlot Features \nThe slot embodies classic features, starting with the size of the grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 20 and fixed, with each spin costing 0.20 € and various betting levels available. The bet can be raised as desired, and the Max Bet button allows for the maximum level to be set with just one click. Among the various features is Autoplay, which allows the player to set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins. The volatility is low, with a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.98%. \n\nAppetite for Destruction Feature \nAs previously mentioned, all symbols in Guns N' Roses evoke the band's imagery. While the cards adorned with roses are the lower value symbols, to win high amounts, players will want to focus on the picks of the Use Your Illusion II and Lies albums, not to mention the images of Axl Rose, Slash, and Duff. The real goodies, however, come from the various bonuses, starting with the two Wilds, normal and expanding, which substitute for all symbols except other special ones. \n\nThe vinyl record is our bonus. If at least three land during a spin, an LP will appear on a turntable and, depending on where the needle stops, players can win a special game: \n- Encore Free Spins: activates ten free spins in which the band members become expanding wilds. \n- Crowd Pleaser Bonus Game: a bonus divided into three levels, rewarding players with free spins and coins. \n- Coin Wins: this bonus offers immediate monetary rewards. \nOther extra features include the Appetite for Destruction Wild, a random cross-shaped wildcard that rewards players with sky-high winnings, and the Legend Spin, in which the band members transform into expanding wilds. \n\nFAQs \nIs the RTP of this slot satisfying? \n\nAbsolutely! We're close to 97%, one of the highest percentages you can find! \n\nWhat does it mean that the volatility is low? \n\nIt means that players can win fairly often, but the prizes aren't very high. \n\nCan I play on my mobile devices? \n\nOf course! Guns N' Roses is designed to run smoothly on any device.\n            ",

Founded by Axl Rose, Slash, and Duff, they are considered to be the greatest rock band ever, especially in the live dimension. It's no wonder that the main screen is a big stage with the game grid in the center and the band's logo in the background, with every symbol recalling the iconic imagery created by the group. To make the game even more special, there are video clips of concerts shown during bonus and special wins. And then there's the soundtrack, composed of five hits, including Welcome to the Jungle, the group's manifesto song, November Rain, and Paradise City. \n\nSlot Features \nThe slot embodies classic features, starting with the size of the grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 20 and fixed, with each spin costing 0.20 € and various betting levels available. The bet can be raised as desired, and the Max Bet button allows for the maximum level to be set with just one click. Among the various features is Autoplay, which allows the player to set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins. The volatility is low, with a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.98%. \n\nAppetite for Destruction Feature \nAs previously mentioned, all symbols in Guns N' Roses evoke the band's imagery. While the cards adorned with roses are the lower value symbols, to win high amounts, players will want to focus on the picks of the Use Your Illusion II and Lies albums, not to mention the images of Axl Rose, Slash, and Duff. The real goodies, however, come from the various bonuses, starting with the two Wilds, normal and expanding, which substitute for all symbols except other special ones. \n\nThe vinyl record is our bonus. If at least three land during a spin, an LP will appear on a turntable and, depending on where the needle stops, players can win a special game: \n- Encore Free Spins: activates ten free spins in which the band members become expanding wilds. \n- Crowd Pleaser Bonus Game: a bonus divided into three levels, rewarding players with free spins and coins. \n- Coin Wins: this bonus offers immediate monetary rewards. \nOther extra features include the Appetite for Destruction Wild, a random cross-shaped wildcard that rewards players with sky-high winnings, and the Legend Spin, in which the band members transform into expanding wilds. \n\nFAQs \nIs the RTP of this slot satisfying? \n\nAbsolutely! We're close to 97%, one of the highest percentages you can find! \n\nWhat does it mean that the volatility is low? \n\nIt means that players can win fairly often, but the prizes aren't very high. \n\nCan I play on my mobile devices? \n\nOf course! Guns N' Roses is designed to run smoothly on any device.\n            ",
