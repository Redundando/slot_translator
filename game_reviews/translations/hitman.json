    "original_text": "\nHitman\nHitman è un nome molto noto che farà tremare il cuore dei giocatori che hanno avuto modo di vedere e apprezzare l’omonimo personaggio dei videogame. Questa slot machine online, realizzata da Microgaming ha una struttura che parte da 5 rulli per 3 con 15 linee di pagamento. A sorprendere sono le caratteristiche bonus del gioco, oltre alla possibilità di vincere un jackpot da capogiro. Potrebbe però far storcere il naso ad alcuni giocatori per il tipo di design presentato, anche se risolleva gli animi grazie a 3 giochi bonus e ai suoi 18 giri gratuiti con i quali si possono moltiplicare le vincite. Di seguito ci concentreremo sui suoi punti di forza, così da conoscere da vicino il gameplay di una slot machine che non può assolutamente passare inosservata.\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nCome accennato poco fa, non è sicuramente la grafica il suo punto di forza: sembra di trovarsi in un videogame anni 2000, non definito a dovere e con una scelta stilistica tutt’altro che moderna. Tra i simboli scelti non possono mancare il noto agente 47, le sue revolver, un coltello, le mitragliatrici e le icone speciali. Il Wild è lo stesso agente, che diventa il Jolly con il quale sostituire tutti i simboli del gameplay in modo da completare le combinazioni anche quando mancano dei simboli. Lo Scatter invece è assegnato a più immagini. Ma prima di iniziare la tua caccia al bersaglio dovrai impostare la scommessa: scegli tra 1 e 15 linee di pagamento, con un valore che si sposta da un minimo di 0,01 a 0,5€.\nSono disponibili più di 30 combinazioni vincenti e quando ne realizzi una si presentano delle animazioni diverse sullo schermo di gioco.\nDegni di nota sono i 3 giochi bonus della slot. Partiamo da Contract, che si attiva quando posizioni 3 simboli bonus sui rulli 3, 4 e 5. Dovrai scegliere il bersaglio, che presenta un numero di monete minimo e massimo da vincere, e un’arma per colpirlo, alla quale si assegna un moltiplicatore casuale da 2x a 5x. Si passa poi a Insigna, che si sblocca con 3 simboli Scatter sui rulli 1, 2 e 3: basterà scegliere uno dei simboli in questione per vincere l’importo a esso abbinato. Per avere i giri gratuiti invece bisogna trovare 3 o più volte l’icona Free Spin sulla griglia. In questa fase le vincite sono raddoppiate e si possono trovare nuovi giochi bonus ma non si ricevono altri spin gratuiti. E infine, con il Wild espandibile puoi far diffondere il Jolly su tutte le caselle, per realizzare combinazioni vincenti su tutte le linee attive.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Hitman\nLa slot Hitman è un buon prodotto, soprattutto se consideriamo che parte da una struttura classica e ha un payout nella media del settore di gioco online. Sono molto valide le sue funzioni e decisamente variegate, capaci di non rendere mai noioso il gameplay. Ogni rotazione, infatti, riesce a regalare emozione e curiosità nel riuscire a sbloccare le ricche funzionalità che abbiamo elencato in questa recensione. Non dimentichiamo poi che ha anche un RTP interessante con un valore pari al 95,84%.\n",

However, the design presented may disappoint some players, although it reinvigorates the spirits thanks to its 3 bonus games and 18 free spins, with which players can multiply their winnings. Below, we will focus on its strengths to get a closer look at the gameplay of a slot machine that cannot go unnoticed.\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nAs mentioned earlier, graphics is not its strong point, as it seems like being in a 2000s video game, not well-defined and with a stylistic choice that is far from modern. Among the chosen symbols, the famous agent 47, his revolvers, a knife, machine guns, and special icons cannot be missed. The Wild is the same agent, which becomes the Joker and can replace all game symbols to complete combinations even when symbols are missing. The Scatter is assigned to multiple images. Before starting your target hunt, however, you must set your bet: choose between 1 and 15 paylines, with a value ranging from a minimum of €0.01 to €0.5.\nMore than 30 winning combinations are available, and when one is realized, different animations appear on the game screen.\nThe slot's 3 bonus games are noteworthy.

You must choose the target, which has a minimum and maximum number of coins to win, and a weapon to hit it, to which a random multiplier of 2x to 5x is assigned. We then move on to Insigna, which is unlocked with 3 Scatter symbols on reels 1, 2, and 3: just choose one of the symbols in question to win the amount associated with it. To get free spins, you must find the Free Spin icon on the grid 3 or more times. During this phase, winnings are doubled, and players can find new bonus games, but they will not receive any more free spins. Lastly, with the expanding Wild, you can spread the Joker over all the boxes to make winning combinations on all active lines.\nFinal Thoughts on the Hitman Slot\nThe Hitman slot is a good product, especially considering that it starts from a classic structure and has a payout average of the online gaming sector. Its functions are very valid and decidedly varied, capable of never making the gameplay boring, as each rotation manages to give excitement and curiosity to unlock the rich features we have listed in this review.

The game draws inspiration from the eponymous video game character and features exciting bonus games, including Contract, Insignia, and expanding Wild. The game's theme and bonus features make it an excellent choice for experienced gamblers.\n\nGameplay and features of Hitman slot\n\nHitman's gameplay is straightforward and starts with placing bets by choosing between 1 and 15 paylines with a value range from 0.01 to 0.5. The game has over 30 winning combinations, and to complete combinations when symbols are missing, Agent 47/Wild appears as the Joker and can replace all game symbols. The Scatter is represented by multiple images. The game's bonus features include Contract, Insignia, and expanding Wild, which add to the excitement and keep the gameplay fresh and engaging with every spin.\n\nSymbols and paylines of Hitman slot\n\nThe game's symbols include the famous Agent 47, his revolvers, a knife, machine guns, and special icons. There are 15 paylines available, and the game has over 30 winning combinations. Players will be delighted to see different animations on the screen when they realize a winning combination. Agent 47/Wild appears as the Joker and can replace all game symbols to complete combinations even when symbols are missing. The Scatter is represented by multiple images.\n\nBonus games and free spins in Hitman slot\n\nHitman features three bonus games that make the gameplay exciting and engaging. Contract, Insignia, and expanding Wild are the bonus games available in the game. Players can activate Contract by getting three bonus symbols on reels 3, 4, and 5. In this bonus game, players must choose a target and a weapon. Insignia is unlocked with three Scatter symbols on reels 1, 2, and 3, in which players must choose one of the symbols to win the associated amount. To get free spins, players need to find the Free Spin icon on the grid three or more times. During this phase, players can find new bonus games, but they will not receive any more free spins.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP) value of Hitman slot\n\nHitman has an attractive RTP value of 95.84%, making it a good choice for players looking for a high payout. Although Hitman's graphics may not be its strongest point, it compensates for this with its exciting bonus features, good payout average, and gameplay that is never boring.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame Features\n\nHitman is a 5-reel, 3-row video slot that features 15 paylines. The game offers players wild and scatter symbols as well as three bonus games and free spins. The wild symbol is represented by the protagonist, Agent 47, and it can replace other symbols on the reels to help players create winning combinations. The bonus games include Insignia, Contract, and Free Spins.\n\nBonus Games\n\nHitman offers players three bonus games to increase their chances of winning big. The Insignia bonus game is activated by getting three scatter symbols on the first three reels. During this bonus game, players can choose one of the Insignia symbols to reveal a cash prize. The Contract bonus game is activated by getting three bonus symbols on reels three, four, and five. In this bonus game, players select a target and a weapon to get a cash prize. The Free Spins bonus game is triggered by getting three or more free spins symbols on the reels, and players can receive up to 18 free spins during this phase.\n\nSymbol Design\n\nThe design of Hitman's symbols is inspired by the video game character, Agent 47. The symbols on the reels include his weapons, such as revolvers, machine guns, and a knife. The wild symbol is the Agent himself, while the scatter symbol is represented by multiple images. The graphics of the game may not be the strongest point, as it looks like a 2000s video game, with poorly defined graphics and a stylistic choice that is not entirely modern.\n\nBetting Options\n\nBefore players start playing Hitman, they need to set their bets. The game offers players 1 to 15 paylines to choose from, with a bet ranging from €0.01 to €0.5. Hitman offers 30 different winning combos players can aim for, and winnings are multiplied by x2 during the free spins bonus game. Players can also take advantage of the expanding wild feature, which spreads Agent 47 over all boxes to make winning combinations on all active paylines.\n\nRTP Value\n\nThe return to player (RTP) value of Hitman is 95.84%, which is slightly higher than the average for online slot games. This means that the game's payout percentage is quite good, and players can expect to receive fewer losses over time.\n\n        \n            ",

This online slot machine, developed by Microgaming, has a structure that starts with 5 reels and 3 rows with 15 paylines. What surprises players are the game's bonus features, in addition to the chance to win an astounding jackpot. However, the design presented may disappoint some players, although it reinvigorates the spirits thanks to its 3 bonus games and 18 free spins, with which players can multiply their winnings. Below, we will focus on its strengths to get a closer look at the gameplay of a slot machine that cannot go unnoticed.\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nAs mentioned earlier, graphics is not its strong point, as it seems like being in a 2000s video game, not well-defined and with a stylistic choice that is far from modern. Among the chosen symbols, the famous agent 47, his revolvers, a knife, machine guns, and special icons cannot be missed. The Wild is the same agent, which becomes the Joker and can replace all game symbols to complete combinations even when symbols are missing. The Scatter is assigned to multiple images. Before starting your target hunt, however, you must set your bet: choose between 1 and 15 paylines, with a value ranging from a minimum of €0.01 to €0.5.\nMore than 30 winning combinations are available, and when one is realized, different animations appear on the game screen.\nThe slot's 3 bonus games are noteworthy. Let's start with Contract, which is activated when you place 3 bonus symbols on reels 3, 4, and 5. You must choose the target, which has a minimum and maximum number of coins to win, and a weapon to hit it, to which a random multiplier of 2x to 5x is assigned. We then move on to Insigna, which is unlocked with 3 Scatter symbols on reels 1, 2, and 3: just choose one of the symbols in question to win the amount associated with it. To get free spins, you must find the Free Spin icon on the grid 3 or more times. During this phase, winnings are doubled, and players can find new bonus games, but they will not receive any more free spins. Lastly, with the expanding Wild, you can spread the Joker over all the boxes to make winning combinations on all active lines.\nFinal Thoughts on the Hitman Slot\nThe Hitman slot is a good product, especially considering that it starts from a classic structure and has a payout average of the online gaming sector. Its functions are very valid and decidedly varied, capable of never making the gameplay boring, as each rotation manages to give excitement and curiosity to unlock the rich features we have listed in this review. Let's not forget that it also has an interesting RTP with a value equal to 95.84%.\n            ",

This online slot machine, developed by Microgaming, has a structure that starts with 5 reels and 3 rows with 15 paylines. What surprises players are the game's bonus features, in addition to the chance to win an astounding jackpot. However, the design presented may disappoint some players, although it reinvigorates the spirits thanks to its 3 bonus games and 18 free spins, with which players can multiply their winnings. Below, we will focus on its strengths to get a closer look at the gameplay of a slot machine that cannot go unnoticed.\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nAs mentioned earlier, graphics is not its strong point, as it seems like being in a 2000s video game, not well-defined and with a stylistic choice that is far from modern. Among the chosen symbols, the famous agent 47, his revolvers, a knife, machine guns, and special icons cannot be missed. The Wild is the same agent, which becomes the Joker and can replace all game symbols to complete combinations even when symbols are missing. The Scatter is assigned to multiple images. Before starting your target hunt, however, you must set your bet: choose between 1 and 15 paylines, with a value ranging from a minimum of €0.01 to €0.5.\nMore than 30 winning combinations are available, and when one is realized, different animations appear on the game screen.\nThe slot's 3 bonus games are noteworthy. Let's start with Contract, which is activated when you place 3 bonus symbols on reels 3, 4, and 5. You must choose the target, which has a minimum and maximum number of coins to win, and a weapon to hit it, to which a random multiplier of 2x to 5x is assigned. We then move on to Insigna, which is unlocked with 3 Scatter symbols on reels 1, 2, and 3: just choose one of the symbols in question to win the amount associated with it. To get free spins, you must find the Free Spin icon on the grid 3 or more times. During this phase, winnings are doubled, and players can find new bonus games, but they will not receive any more free spins. Lastly, with the expanding Wild, you can spread the Joker over all the boxes to make winning combinations on all active lines.\nFinal Thoughts on the Hitman Slot\nThe Hitman slot is a good product, especially considering that it starts from a classic structure and has a payout average of the online gaming sector. Its functions are very valid and decidedly varied, capable of never making the gameplay boring, as each rotation manages to give excitement and curiosity to unlock the rich features we have listed in this review. Let's not forget that it also has an interesting RTP with a value equal to 95.84%.\n        ",
