With the slot game El Diablo released in the hot summer of 2022 by G Games, you can fly on fiery reels and meet this shady figure in Mexican Calavera version. Mr. Diablo is waiting for you in his realm of stacked wilds and enhanced multipliers!\n\nEl Diablo: RTP, Volatility, and other game features\nEl Diablo is a slot machine released by innovative developer G Games (the one behind Elite of Evil - Portal of Gold and Zeldar's Fortune), with classic 5x3 reels.

But to achieve it, you'll need the Free Spins feature, which increases your chances of winning on multiple paylines simultaneously. And for the maximum value at stake, you'll need to cover all points with devil symbols.\n\nLooking for a game with better RTP? Try Diablo Reels by ELK Studios. This is another one of the many online slots available to play for free here on Slotjava.\n\nValue of bets and winnings in the paytable\nBets in El Diablo range from 0.10 to 200. The Paytable for combinations of five identical icons is as follows:\n\nBartender = 500x\nChili Peppers and Diamond Chili Pepper = 250x\nJoker, Queen, Heart Pepper, and Club Pepper = 100x\nBonus Scatter = 15x\n\nEl Diablo bonus features\n\nThe Bonus Symbol appears on reels 1, 3, and 5.

The adjustable autospin is convenient, allowing you to set different limits for each round.\n\nFAQs\nCan I play El Diablo on my smartphone?\n\nCertainly.

It guarantees 20x, 50x, and 100x your bet.\n\nWhat is the RTP of El Diablo?\n\nThe theoretical return to player reaches 95%, a value that is a bit too low for such a recent version. Rival studios continue to release free slots that exceed this slightly \"chewed\" percentage.\n            ",
