Cowboys on horseback, ruthless criminals governed by their own morals, sheriffs and Native Americans, desert landscapes – all the ingredients that immediately transport us to a Wild West setting. Big Bucks Bandits Megaways, a slot produced by Reelplay, boasts stunning graphics, with the desert reliefs of the Grand Canyon as a backdrop and a large game board occupying most of the screen. The four jackpots are listed on the left along with the button to purchase the bonus game. The musical accompaniment is a melody composed of guitars and flutes that strongly recalls the soundtracks of Sergio Leone's films.\nKey features:\nThe game board has six reels and three lines that become four only on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5. There are 117,649 ways to win, with a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €25. Winning combinations go from left to right, and players can activate from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 100 automatic spins. Big Bucks Bandits Megaways has a fairly good RTP, at 96.102%.\nSymbols and features of Big Bucks Bandits Megaways:\nIt's worth noting that this slot features a cascade mechanism: after every winning combination, all paying symbols explode and are replaced by new symbols that can produce additional wins. The lowest value symbols include cacti, hats, boots and guns, while the horse, the bandit with a bandanna over his face and the noblewoman pay out more. Among the regular symbols, the hero with the cigar between his lips pays out the most. The Wild symbol is represented by the sheriff's star, can only appear on the top reel, and replaces all symbols except for the Scatter.\nThe golden bag full of banknotes is the Scatter symbol. If it appears six times, then the Respin Jackpot Bank Heist is activated, which gives players three free spins. All Scatter symbols remain on the board during the bonus game, and if new ones appear, they will also remain on the reels. Additionally, every time a new Scatter symbol lands on the board, the count of free spins will start again from three. Respin Jackpot Bank Heist always grants a jackpot or a prize. In the case of the jackpot, it's a multiplier ranging from 10x (Bronze Jackpot) to a maximum of 1000 (Platinum Jackpot).\nFor 1,200 credits, players can purchase the Double Cross betting feature, in which they are challenged to take on the masked criminal to try and seize his stolen treasure. It starts with a Respin Jackpot Bank Heist with at least six Scatter symbols guaranteed, and then the real challenge begins. Each time players manage to hit the green slice of the wheel with their pistol, they are rewarded with a progressive multiplier, up to a maximum of five times!\n            ",
