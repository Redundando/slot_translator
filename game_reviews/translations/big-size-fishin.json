The game offers a classic 5x3 grid with 10 fixed paylines. The game has a minimum bet of €0.10, up to €50 maximum. Players can set up to 100 automatic spins using the Autoplay function, making it a convenient option. This medium-high variance game has a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 95.3%, making it an attractive option for experienced gamblers. \n\nGameplay of Big Size Fishin'\n\nThe gameplay in Big Size Fishin' is easy to understand. Players can land identical adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and moving towards the right. The game features ten base symbols, including playing cards (10 to Ace), fish, an artificial bait feather, a float, a rod, a chest, and a fisherman. The fisherman represents the Wild symbol that can substitute for any missing symbols, except the Scatter symbol. Players can trigger Free Spins by landing three, four, or five Scatters. Before the Free Spins start, the second reel at the second row (2.2) and the third reel at the second row (3.2) are framed by a rope, with both positions awarded a 2x multiplier.\n\nSymbols in Big Size Fishin'\n\nBig Size Fishin' has ten base symbols, evenly divided into low and high levels. The low-level symbols include playing cards from 10 to Ace, while the high-level symbols include fish, an artificial bait feather, a float, a rod, and a chest. The fisherman represents the Wild symbol, substituting for any missing symbols to create winning combinations. The only symbol it can't substitute for is the Scatter symbol, which is represented by a boat.\n\nFree Spins in Big Size Fishin'\n\nLanding three, four, or five Scatters triggers 10, 15, or 20 Free Spins, respectively. Before the Free Spins start, the second reel at the second row (2.2) and the third reel at the second row (3.2) are framed by a rope, with both positions awarded a 2x multiplier. After each Free Spin, a new position may be framed, or the multiplier may increase by 1. The multipliers apply only to the fish that land within the framed positions. If a Wild symbol lands within the framed positions, it takes all the fish and adds them to your balance. Free Spins can be increased by landing more Scatters.\n\nExperience of playing Big Size Fishin'\n\nBig Size Fishin' is a visually stunning game with crisp lines and color shading that make the symbols stand out. The music accompanying the Spins is also spot on, immersing you deeper into the game's atmosphere. Although the game is easy to understand, experienced gamblers will appreciate its medium-high variance and its theoretical return to player (RTP) of 95.3%. The game is available on top online casinos, and players can try a free demo version of the game before staking any real money.\n\n        \n            ",

The stunning graphics will take your breath away, transporting you to the heart of the ocean with dark blue waves suggesting the deep sea. The crisp lines and color shading make the symbols stand out, making it easy to spot winning combinations. The music accompanying the Spins is also spot on, immersing you deeper into the game's atmosphere. \n\nThe game has a classic 5x3 grid with 10 fixed paylines, allowing you to land identical adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and moving towards the right. The minimum bet is only €0.10, which is perfect for those looking for a quick thrill without breaking the bank. The Autoplay function lets you set up to 100 automatic spins, making it a convenient option. With a medium-high variance and a solid theoretical return to player (RTP) set at 95.3%, Big Size Fishin' ticks all the boxes for experienced gamblers. \n\nThe game features ten base symbols evenly divided into low and high levels. The low-level symbols include playing cards from 10 to Ace, and the high-level symbols include fish, an artificial bait feather, a float, a rod, and a chest. The fisherman represents the Wild symbol, substituting for any missing symbols to create winning combinations. The only symbol it can't substitute for is the Scatter symbol, which is represented by a boat. Landing three, four, or five Scatters triggers 10, 15, or 20 Free Spins, respectively. Before the Free Spins start, the second reel at the second row (2.2) and the third reel at the second row (3.2) are framed by a rope, with both positions awarded a 2x multiplier. \n\nAfter each Free Spin, two things can happen: a new position may be framed, or the multiplier may increase by 1. The multipliers apply only to the fish that land within the framed positions. If a Wild symbol lands within the framed positions, it takes all the fish and adds them to your balance. Free Spins can be increased by more landed Scatters. \n\nBig Size Fishin' is an exciting game from Red Rake that is sure to appeal to all experienced gamblers. Keep an eye out for it on a top online casino near you! Plus, you can always try a free demo version of the game to get a feel for it before staking any real money.\n            ",
