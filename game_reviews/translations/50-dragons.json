    "original_text": "\n50 Dragons\nIn questa recensione ti presenteremo 50 Dragons, una slot machine che ti ammalierà e della quale non potrai più fare a meno. È prodotta da Aristocrat, la cui caratteristica principale è quella di soprendere continuamente con tipiche ambientazioni asiatiche. Giocando a questa slot, verrai quindi trasportato nel mondo orientale, con le sue simbologie e le sue atmosfere misteriose e suggestive. Protagonista di quest’avventura sarà infatti il drago, emblema della cultura del Sol Levante proposto in varie slot della Aristocrat. Sei pronto ad iniziare quest’avventura?\nLa 50 Dragons slot machine presenta 50 linee di pagamento provenienti dalla EGT, e presenta una vasta gamma di premi che aspettano solo di essere vinti. La vincita massima ammonta infatti a 125.000€!\nSe sei pronto a vincere tanti soldi e a vivere un’esperienza unica ambientata nell’Oriente, la slot 50 Dragons fa per te, perciò, continua a leggere quest’articolo.\nGrafica\nCome abbiamo già detto, il tema dominante presente in questa slot è quello dell’Antico Oriente, e questa sua particolarità la notiamo soprattutto dalla grafica del gioco. Ogni elemento della slot e dell’ambientazione è infatti utilizzato per trasportarti al meglio in questo mondo di ricchezze e di simboli dogmatici. Il colore utilizzato principalmente è infatti l’oro, a ricordare i tesori posseduti dai paesi orientali, idea accompagnata da simboli caratteristici presenti sulle linee di pagamento, come i lingotti, i dragoni dorati, le tigri, le maschere, le carpe, i pavoni. Ognuno di essi ricoperto d’oro e rappresentante la vasta cultura orientale. Ovviamente anche i simboli delle carte da gioco vengono utilizzati: J, Q, K, A… anche se non rendono onore alla mistica ambientazione orientaleggiante.\nLa grafica è certamente un elemento di notevole importanza all’interno di un gioco come questo, poiché l’impatto visivo è il primo che colpisce l’attenzione del giocatore e deve essere in grado di rendere la giocata piacevole. Aristocrat è riuscita benissimo in questo intento con la slot 50 Dragons, ma non finisce qui. Perché un altro punto di forza del gioco è la varietà di funzioni e simboli che presenta.\nContinua a leggere per saperne di più.\nFunzioni e simboli\nI simboli e le funzioni più importanti che contribuiranno a rendere emozionante ogni tua partita sulla slot 50 Dragons sono:\n\nla Perla, che corrisponde al simbolo “Wild” e svolge la funzione di jolly, sostituendo il simbolo mancante per una vincita nei rulli 2, 3, 4 e 5;\nil Lingotto rappresenta invece il simbolo “Scatter” e permette di ottenere il bonus Free Spins e una moltiplicazione della puntata ogniqualvolta se ne presentino 3 in modo sparso tra i primi 3 rulli;\ne la “Funzione Puntata” che consiste in un gioco aggiuntivo, disponibile dopo ogni vincita, nel quale si può tentare di indovinare il colore o il seme di una carta per aumentare la vincita precedente.\n\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nSe l’esperienza con la slot 50 Dragons ti entusiasma al punto da cercare altre slot simili, ovvero con un tema basato sull’Antico Oriente e la sua cultura, non possiamo fare a meno di proporti un’altra esperienza di gioco: la slot Dragon Lines prodotta da Ainsworth, attraverso la quale ti ritroverai nell’affascinante cultura cinese.\n",
