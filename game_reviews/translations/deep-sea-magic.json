Se al primo impatto ti sembrerà un gioco standard, presto ti ricrederai, provando la nuova funzione Drop & Lock ideata da questa software house. Sei pronto a goderti un originalissimo gameplay? Allora prosegui nella lettura della mia recensione online.\nDeep Sea Magic RTP, puntata e varianza\nDeep Sea Magic, composta da 5 rulli e 50 linee di pagamento, ha un RTP di buon livello pari al 96,01%. Puoi scommettere da 0,25€ a un massimo di 200,00€. Puoi giocare a questa slot machine nei casinò AAMS-ADM ospitati nella nostra libreria, per non perdere nessuna novità. Quali sono le funzioni principali? Moltiplicatore di Bonus, Drop and Lock, Respins, Stacked Wilds, Sticky Symbols, Wilds, sono solo alcune delle funzionalità disponibili in questo gioco. C’è anche un Bonus di Giri Gratuiti e se sei fortunato questo ti farà vincere delle belle ricompense!\nIcone e funzioni più importanti in Deep Sea Magic\nIcona della Sirena Selvaggia\nIn Deep Sea Magic, il simbolo jolly ha naturalmente la forma di una sirena. Questo jolly può prendere il posto di tutti i simboli regolari se produce una combinazione vincente. Esso può anche apparire impilato e coprire l’intero rullo. Il simbolo jolly può sostituire solo sui tre rulli centrali in Deep Sea Magic.\nChe cos’è la Funzione Drop and Lock?\nCi sono ulteriori simboli speciali in questa slot: mi riferisco alle sfere di vetro arancioni e blu che possono attivare la funzione Drop and Lock. Quando giri tre palline di vetro attivi questa funzione e puoi guadagnare i premi in denaro. Le palline blu producono un massimo di 2 volte la puntata, mentre le palline arancioni producono un minimo di 2 volte la scommessa. La funzione Drop and Lock è composta da tre giri in cui devi far girare sfere extra. Ogni volta che appare una sfera blu o arancione, il tuo numero di giri viene resettato a tre.\nDeep Sea Magic Giri Gratis e funzione Moltiplicatore\nLa Piramide d’Oro è il simbolo bonus che può aiutarti a ottenere giri gratuiti. Questo simbolo può apparire solo sui tre rulli centrali e quando ne vedi uno su tutti e tre, ottieni sei giri gratuiti. Inoltre, riceverai un pagamento di 5 volte la tua scommessa per l’attivazione dei giri gratuiti. I giri gratuiti non si attivano nel mare profondo ma al’interno di una piramide. Una volta che i giri gratuiti iniziano, vedrai apparire un Moltiplicatore in alto a destra sui rulli. Esso inizia con lo stesso numero corrispondente a quello delle piramidi appena girate. Un esempio? Se giri 3 Piramidi per attivare i giri gratuiti, inizierai con un moltiplicatore x3. Se giri una piramide durante i giri gratuiti, ottieni altri 6 giri gratuiti e un Moltiplicatore più alto. Esso si attiva solo quando i tuoi primi 6 giri sono terminati. Puoi anche far partire la funzione Drop and Lock durante i giri gratuiti, ma i premi non verranno moltiplicati.\nLe mie valutazioni conclusive su Deep Sea Magic\nIn termini di design, Deep Sea Magic è davvero ben realizzato. Considerando poi le sue funzioni extra e l’ottimo round di bonus, ti consiglio vivamente questo titolo, nonostante il suo  RTP non troppo elevato. Mi è capitato di recensire slot gratis con RTP ancora più basso e mi sono divertita molto a giocarci, quindi perché non dovrebbe essere così anche per questa slot di Shuffle Master? Non dimenticare di dare un’occhiata alle ultime recensioni di slot marine presenti in vetrina, una su tutte Ocean Treasure di NetEnt!\n\nFAQ - Domande frequenti sulla slot Deep Sea Magic \nSi può giocare in modalità Demo?\n\nCerto, la slot Deep Sea Magic fa parte delle oltre 1390 slot gratuite offerte nella nostra libreria.\n\n\n\nSono presenti funzioni extra in questa slot di Shuffle Master?\n\nCertamente, non perdere il Jolly, la funzione Drop & Lock, i Giri Gratis e il Moltiplicatore che aumenteranno le tue vincite nelle profondità oceaniche!\n\n\n\nQual è la puntata minima per puntare su questa slot gratis?\n\nLa scommessa iniziale può partire da 0,25 € fino ad un massimo di 200,00 €.\n\n\n\nQuanto vale l’RTP della slot Deep Sea Magic?\n\nIn questo gioco il valore è pari al 96,01%, quindi non altissimo.\n\n\n\n",

            "response": "Deep Sea Magic: A Review for Experienced Gamblers\n\nThe mysterious depths of the sea theme is a popular one among slot game developers, and Shuffle Master's \"Deep Sea Magic\" is no exception. At first glance, it may seem like your standard game, but you will soon discover the innovative Drop & Lock feature created by this software house that sets it apart from the rest. Are you ready for an original gameplay experience? Then read on for my online review.\n\nDeep Sea Magic RTP, Bet, and Variance\n\nDeep Sea Magic consists of 5 reels and 50 paylines, with an RTP of 96.01%, making it a good choice for experienced gamblers. You can bet from €0.25 to a maximum of €200.00. This slot machine is available in AAMS-ADM casinos hosted in our library to ensure you don't miss out on any updates. Some of the main features include Bonus Multiplier, Drop and Lock, Respins, Stacked Wilds, Sticky Symbols, and Wilds. Plus, there's a Free Spins Bonus which, if you're lucky, can reward you with some big wins!\n\nImportant Icons and Features in Deep Sea Magic\n\nWild Mermaid Icon\n\nThe wild symbol in Deep Sea Magic is naturally shaped like a mermaid. This symbol can replace all regular symbols to form a winning combination. It can also appear stacked and cover an entire reel. The wild symbol can only substitute for symbols on the three middle reels in Deep Sea Magic.\n\nWhat is the Drop and Lock Feature?\n\nThere are also additional special symbols in this slot, referring to the orange and blue glass spheres that can activate the Drop and Lock feature. When you spin three glass balls, you activate this feature and can earn cash prizes. The blue balls produce a maximum of 2 times the bet, while the orange balls produce a minimum of 2 times the bet. The Drop and Lock feature consists of three spins in which you must spin extra spheres. Each time a blue or orange sphere appears, your number of spins is reset to three.\n\nDeep Sea Magic Free Spins and Multiplier Feature\n\nThe Golden Pyramid is the bonus symbol that can help you win free spins. This symbol can only appear on the three middle reels, and when you see one on all three, you get six free spins. Additionally, you will receive a payout of 5 times your bet for activating the free spins. Free spins are not activated in the deep sea but inside a pyramid. Once the free spins start, you will see a Multiplier appear in the top-right corner of the reels. It starts with the same number as the pyramids just spun. For example, if you spin 3 pyramids to activate the free spins, you will start with a 3x multiplier. If you spin a pyramid during the free spins, you get another 6 free spins and a higher Multiplier, which activates only after your first 6 spins. You can also activate the Drop and Lock feature during free spins, but the rewards will not be multiplied.\n\nFinal Ratings for Deep Sea Magic\n\nIn terms of design, Deep Sea Magic is well-executed, and with its extra features and excellent bonus round, I highly recommend it despite its not-too-high RTP. I have reviewed free slots with even lower RTP and had a blast, so why not give this Shuffle Master slot a try? Don't forget to check out the latest marine slot reviews featured in our slot library, including Ocean Treasure by NetEnt!\n\nFAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about Deep Sea Magic Slot\n\nCan I play in Demo mode?\n\nYes, Deep Sea Magic is one of the over 1390 free slot games offered in our library.\n\nAre there any extra features in this Shuffle Master slot?\n\nAbsolutely, don't miss out on the Wild, Drop & Lock feature, Free Spins, and Multiplier, which can increase your wins in the depths of the ocean!\n\nWhat is the minimum bet for this free slot?\n\nThe initial bet can start from €0.25 up to a maximum of €200.00.\n\nWhat is the RTP value of Deep Sea Magic slot?\n\nThe game's RTP value is 96.01%, which is not very high but still decent for experienced gamblers.",

The free spins do not activate in the deep sea but inside a pyramid.\n\nOnce the free spins start, you will see a Multiplier appearing at the top right of the reels. It starts with the same number corresponding to the pyramids just spun. For example, if you spin 3 Pyramids to activate the free spins, you will start with a x3 multiplier. If you spin a pyramid during the free spins, you get another 6 free spins and a higher Multiplier. It only activates when your first 6 spins are over. You can also start the Drop and Lock feature during free spins, but rewards will not be multiplied.\n\nMy final thoughts on Deep Sea Magic\n\nIn terms of design, Deep Sea Magic is really well made. Considering its extra features and great bonus round, I highly recommend this title, despite its not too high RTP. I have reviewed free slots with even lower RTPs and had a great time playing them, so why shouldn't it be the same for this Shuffle Master slot? Don't forget to check out the latest marine slot reviews on display, one of which is Ocean Treasure by NetEnt!\n\nFAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about Deep Sea Magic Slot\n\nCan you play in Demo mode?\n\nCertainly, the Deep Sea Magic slot is part of the over 1390 free slots offered in our library.\n\nAre there any extra features in this Shuffle Master slot?\n\nCertainly, don't miss out on the Wild, the Drop & Lock feature, Free Spins, and the Multiplier that will increase your winnings in the ocean depths!\n\nWhat is the minimum bet to bet on this free slot?\n\nThe initial bet can start from €0.25 up to a maximum of €200.\n\nWhat is the RTP value of the Deep Sea Magic slot?\n\nIn this game, the value is 96.01%, so not very high."

At first glance, it may seem like your standard game, but you will soon discover the innovative Drop & Lock feature created by this software house that sets it apart from the rest. Are you ready for an original gameplay experience? Then read on for my online review.\n\nDeep Sea Magic RTP, Bet, and Variance\n\nDeep Sea Magic consists of 5 reels and 50 paylines, with an RTP of 96.01%, making it a good choice for experienced gamblers. You can bet from €0.25 to a maximum of €200.00. This slot machine is available in AAMS-ADM casinos hosted in our library to ensure you don't miss out on any updates. Some of the main features include Bonus Multiplier, Drop and Lock, Respins, Stacked Wilds, Sticky Symbols, and Wilds. Plus, there's a Free Spins Bonus which, if you're lucky, can reward you with some big wins!\n\nImportant Icons and Features in Deep Sea Magic\n\nWild Mermaid Icon\n\nThe wild symbol in Deep Sea Magic is naturally shaped like a mermaid. This symbol can replace all regular symbols to form a winning combination. It can also appear stacked and cover an entire reel. The wild symbol can only substitute for symbols on the three middle reels in Deep Sea Magic.\n\nWhat is the Drop and Lock Feature?\n\nThere are also additional special symbols in this slot, referring to the orange and blue glass spheres that can activate the Drop and Lock feature. When you spin three glass balls, you activate this feature and can earn cash prizes. The blue balls produce a maximum of 2 times the bet, while the orange balls produce a minimum of 2 times the bet. The Drop and Lock feature consists of three spins in which you must spin extra spheres. Each time a blue or orange sphere appears, your number of spins is reset to three.\n\nDeep Sea Magic Free Spins and Multiplier Feature\n\nThe Golden Pyramid is the bonus symbol that can help you win free spins. This symbol can only appear on the three middle reels, and when you see one on all three, you get six free spins. Additionally, you will receive a payout of 5 times your bet for activating the free spins. Free spins are not activated in the deep sea but inside a pyramid. Once the free spins start, you will see a Multiplier appear in the top-right corner of the reels. It starts with the same number as the pyramids just spun. For example, if you spin 3 pyramids to activate the free spins, you will start with a 3x multiplier. If you spin a pyramid during the free spins, you get another 6 free spins and a higher Multiplier, which activates only after your first 6 spins. You can also activate the Drop and Lock feature during free spins, but the rewards will not be multiplied.\n\nFinal Ratings for Deep Sea Magic\n\nIn terms of design, Deep Sea Magic is well-executed, and with its extra features and excellent bonus round, I highly recommend it despite its not-too-high RTP.

This symbol can replace all regular symbols to form a winning combination. It can also appear stacked and cover an entire reel. The wild symbol can only substitute for symbols on the three middle reels in Deep Sea Magic.\n\nWhat is the Drop and Lock Feature?\n\nThere are also additional special symbols in this slot, referring to the orange and blue glass spheres that can activate the Drop and Lock feature.

This symbol can only appear on the three middle reels, and when you see one on all three, you get six free spins. Additionally, you will receive a payout of 5 times your bet for activating the free spins. Free spins are not activated in the deep sea but inside a pyramid.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame Developer\nGame Features\nRTP\nPaylines\nBonus Round\nBetting Range\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Deep Sea Magic: A Review for Experienced Gamblers\n\nThe mysterious depths of the sea theme is a popular one among slot game developers, and Shuffle Master's \"Deep Sea Magic\" is no exception. At first glance, it may seem like your standard game, but you will soon discover the innovative Drop & Lock feature created by this software house that sets it apart from the rest. Are you ready for an original gameplay experience? Then read on for my online review.\n\nDeep Sea Magic RTP, Bet, and Variance\n\nDeep Sea Magic consists of 5 reels and 50 paylines, with an RTP of 96.01%, making it a good choice for experienced gamblers. You can bet from €0.25 to a maximum of €200.00. This slot machine is available in AAMS-ADM casinos hosted in our library to ensure you don't miss out on any updates. Some of the main features include Bonus Multiplier, Drop and Lock, Respins, Stacked Wilds, Sticky Symbols, and Wilds. Plus, there's a Free Spins Bonus which, if you're lucky, can reward you with some big wins!\n\nImportant Icons and Features in Deep Sea Magic\n\nWild Mermaid Icon\n\nThe wild symbol in Deep Sea Magic is naturally shaped like a mermaid. This symbol can replace all regular symbols to form a winning combination. It can also appear stacked and cover an entire reel. The wild symbol can only substitute for symbols on the three middle reels in Deep Sea Magic.\n\nWhat is the Drop and Lock Feature?\n\nThere are also additional special symbols in this slot, referring to the orange and blue glass spheres that can activate the Drop and Lock feature. When you spin three glass balls, you activate this feature and can earn cash prizes. The blue balls produce a maximum of 2 times the bet, while the orange balls produce a minimum of 2 times the bet. The Drop and Lock feature consists of three spins in which you must spin extra spheres. Each time a blue or orange sphere appears, your number of spins is reset to three.\n\nDeep Sea Magic Free Spins and Multiplier Feature\n\nThe Golden Pyramid is the bonus symbol that can help you win free spins. This symbol can only appear on the three middle reels, and when you see one on all three, you get six free spins. Additionally, you will receive a payout of 5 times your bet for activating the free spins. Free spins are not activated in the deep sea but inside a pyramid. Once the free spins start, you will see a Multiplier appear in the top-right corner of the reels. It starts with the same number as the pyramids just spun. For example, if you spin 3 pyramids to activate the free spins, you will start with a 3x multiplier. If you spin a pyramid during the free spins, you get another 6 free spins and a higher Multiplier, which activates only after your first 6 spins. You can also activate the Drop and Lock feature during free spins, but the rewards will not be multiplied.\n\nFinal Ratings for Deep Sea Magic\n\nIn terms of design, Deep Sea Magic is well-executed, and with its extra features and excellent bonus round, I highly recommend it despite its not-too-high RTP. I have reviewed free slots with even lower RTP and had a blast, so why not give this Shuffle Master slot a try? Don't forget to check out the latest marine slot reviews featured in our slot library, including Ocean Treasure by NetEnt!\n\nFAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about Deep Sea Magic Slot\n\nCan I play in Demo mode?\n\nYes, Deep Sea Magic is one of the over 1390 free slot games offered in our library.\n\nAre there any extra features in this Shuffle Master slot?\n\nAbsolutely, don't miss out on the Wild, Drop & Lock feature, Free Spins, and Multiplier, which can increase your wins in the depths of the ocean!\n\nWhat is the minimum bet for this free slot?\n\nThe initial bet can start from €0.25 up to a maximum of €200.00.\n\nWhat is the RTP value of Deep Sea Magic slot?\n\nThe game's RTP value is 96.01%, which is not very high but still decent for experienced gamblers.\n            ",

The company is known for creating innovative slot games with unique gameplay features that keep players engaged.\n\nGame Features\n\nDeep Sea Magic has several features that make it stand out in the market. The game has 5 reels and 50 paylines, which is common in slot games. It also has a Wild Mermaid Icon that can substitute all regular symbols, and a unique Drop and Lock feature that can earn you cash prizes if you spin three blue or orange glass spheres. In addition, the game has Free Spins, Multiplier, Stacked Wilds, Sticky Symbols, and Bonus Multiplier features.\n\nRTP\n\nDeep Sea Magic has an RTP of 96.01%, which is considered decent for experienced gamblers. Shuffle Master has ensured that the payout percentage is above average to attract more players to the game.\n\nPaylines\n\nDeep Sea Magic's 50 paylines are more than what you'd normally expect in a slot game. It gives players more opportunities to match symbols and win prizes. However, it's important to remember that betting per payline increases your chances of winning, so it's essential to find a balance between the number of paylines and your betting range.\n\nBonus Round\n\nDeep Sea Magic's Bonus Round is the Free Spins feature, activated when you land bonus symbols on the three middle reels.

At first glance, it may seem like your standard game, but you will soon discover the innovative Drop & Lock feature created by this software house that sets it apart from the rest. Are you ready for an original gameplay experience? Then read on for my online review.\n\nDeep Sea Magic RTP, Bet, and Variance\n\nDeep Sea Magic consists of 5 reels and 50 paylines, with an RTP of 96.01%, making it a good choice for experienced gamblers. You can bet from €0.25 to a maximum of €200.00. This slot machine is available in AAMS-ADM casinos hosted in our library to ensure you don't miss out on any updates. Some of the main features include Bonus Multiplier, Drop and Lock, Respins, Stacked Wilds, Sticky Symbols, and Wilds. Plus, there's a Free Spins Bonus which, if you're lucky, can reward you with some big wins!\n\nImportant Icons and Features in Deep Sea Magic\n\nWild Mermaid Icon\n\nThe wild symbol in Deep Sea Magic is naturally shaped like a mermaid. This symbol can replace all regular symbols to form a winning combination. It can also appear stacked and cover an entire reel. The wild symbol can only substitute for symbols on the three middle reels in Deep Sea Magic.\n\nWhat is the Drop and Lock Feature?\n\nThere are also additional special symbols in this slot, referring to the orange and blue glass spheres that can activate the Drop and Lock feature. When you spin three glass balls, you activate this feature and can earn cash prizes. The blue balls produce a maximum of 2 times the bet, while the orange balls produce a minimum of 2 times the bet. The Drop and Lock feature consists of three spins in which you must spin extra spheres. Each time a blue or orange sphere appears, your number of spins is reset to three.\n\nDeep Sea Magic Free Spins and Multiplier Feature\n\nThe Golden Pyramid is the bonus symbol that can help you win free spins. This symbol can only appear on the three middle reels, and when you see one on all three, you get six free spins. Additionally, you will receive a payout of 5 times your bet for activating the free spins. Free spins are not activated in the deep sea but inside a pyramid. Once the free spins start, you will see a Multiplier appear in the top-right corner of the reels. It starts with the same number as the pyramids just spun. For example, if you spin 3 pyramids to activate the free spins, you will start with a 3x multiplier. If you spin a pyramid during the free spins, you get another 6 free spins and a higher Multiplier, which activates only after your first 6 spins. You can also activate the Drop and Lock feature during free spins, but the rewards will not be multiplied.\n\nFinal Ratings for Deep Sea Magic\n\nIn terms of design, Deep Sea Magic is well-executed, and with its extra features and excellent bonus round, I highly recommend it despite its not-too-high RTP. I have reviewed free slots with even lower RTP and had a blast, so why not give this Shuffle Master slot a try? Don't forget to check out the latest marine slot reviews featured in our slot library, including Ocean Treasure by NetEnt!\n\nFAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about Deep Sea Magic Slot\n\nCan I play in Demo mode?\n\nYes, Deep Sea Magic is one of the over 1390 free slot games offered in our library.\n\nAre there any extra features in this Shuffle Master slot?\n\nAbsolutely, don't miss out on the Wild, Drop & Lock feature, Free Spins, and Multiplier, which can increase your wins in the depths of the ocean!\n\nWhat is the minimum bet for this free slot?\n\nThe initial bet can start from €0.25 up to a maximum of €200.00.\n\nWhat is the RTP value of Deep Sea Magic slot?\n\nThe game's RTP value is 96.01%, which is not very high but still decent for experienced gamblers.\n            ",

At first glance, it may seem like your standard game, but you will soon discover the innovative Drop & Lock feature created by this software house that sets it apart from the rest. Are you ready for an original gameplay experience? Then read on for my online review.\n\nDeep Sea Magic RTP, Bet, and Variance\n\nDeep Sea Magic consists of 5 reels and 50 paylines, with an RTP of 96.01%, making it a good choice for experienced gamblers. You can bet from €0.25 to a maximum of €200.00. This slot machine is available in AAMS-ADM casinos hosted in our library to ensure you don't miss out on any updates. Some of the main features include Bonus Multiplier, Drop and Lock, Respins, Stacked Wilds, Sticky Symbols, and Wilds. Plus, there's a Free Spins Bonus which, if you're lucky, can reward you with some big wins!\n\nImportant Icons and Features in Deep Sea Magic\n\nWild Mermaid Icon\n\nThe wild symbol in Deep Sea Magic is naturally shaped like a mermaid. This symbol can replace all regular symbols to form a winning combination. It can also appear stacked and cover an entire reel. The wild symbol can only substitute for symbols on the three middle reels in Deep Sea Magic.\n\nWhat is the Drop and Lock Feature?\n\nThere are also additional special symbols in this slot, referring to the orange and blue glass spheres that can activate the Drop and Lock feature. When you spin three glass balls, you activate this feature and can earn cash prizes. The blue balls produce a maximum of 2 times the bet, while the orange balls produce a minimum of 2 times the bet. The Drop and Lock feature consists of three spins in which you must spin extra spheres. Each time a blue or orange sphere appears, your number of spins is reset to three.\n\nDeep Sea Magic Free Spins and Multiplier Feature\n\nThe Golden Pyramid is the bonus symbol that can help you win free spins. This symbol can only appear on the three middle reels, and when you see one on all three, you get six free spins. Additionally, you will receive a payout of 5 times your bet for activating the free spins. Free spins are not activated in the deep sea but inside a pyramid. Once the free spins start, you will see a Multiplier appear in the top-right corner of the reels. It starts with the same number as the pyramids just spun. For example, if you spin 3 pyramids to activate the free spins, you will start with a 3x multiplier. If you spin a pyramid during the free spins, you get another 6 free spins and a higher Multiplier, which activates only after your first 6 spins. You can also activate the Drop and Lock feature during free spins, but the rewards will not be multiplied.\n\nFinal Ratings for Deep Sea Magic\n\nIn terms of design, Deep Sea Magic is well-executed, and with its extra features and excellent bonus round, I highly recommend it despite its not-too-high RTP. I have reviewed free slots with even lower RTP and had a blast, so why not give this Shuffle Master slot a try?
