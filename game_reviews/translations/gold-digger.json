Con un banjo che suona mentre si fanno girare i rulli, ci si dirige verso il pozzo di una miniera alla ricerca dell’oro. Con il personaggio del gioco a sinistra dei rulli, i simboli appariranno all’ingresso di un pozzo minerario.

            "response": "Gold Digger\n\nThis slot game stands out from all the others you've tried so far because of its reel modifiers. They occur entirely at random, and you'll notice them because the man on the left reacts with a surprised gesture. He can throw a pick on the reels to unleash wild symbols and do a couple of other things that can increase your chances of winning for that round. \n\nGold Digger has 5 reels and 20 paylines. Powered by iSoftBet, this mining-themed game can be played from 20 cents per spin on all devices. With an RTP of 96%, there are 3 random base game features where you can get extra wilds, transform symbols into gold nuggets, and upgrade low-value symbols. In the Gold Link Respins feature, you get even more gold nuggets and therefore higher cash prizes. To help you out, gems land to add multipliers, increase gold nugget values, assign extra respins, and add more rows. You can win up to 8,230x your bet.\n\nA Mining-Themed Graphics\n\nGold Digger's graphics have a mining theme. With a banjo playing while the reels spin, you head towards a mine shaft in search of gold. With the game's character on the left of the reels, the symbols will appear at the entrance of a mining shaft. It's all very colorful and bright. \n\nThe symbols include A, K, Q, and J, which are the classic playing card symbols. You'll also come across mining axes, lanterns, mining carts, and the gold prospector Gus himself. The latter pays 7.5x, 12.5x, or 25x your stake for 3, 4, or 5 of the same symbols in combination. There is an explosion symbol that is the wild. This replaces all symbols except gold nuggets and gems to create winning combinations. \n\nIf you don't like folk music, you may want to mute the background music. In any case, you can play Gold Digger on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices, provided the devices use iOS, Android, or Windows technology. \n\nIn terms of the slot's design, iSoftBet has done a great job of bringing the best of gold mining activity. The symbols are in line with what you'd expect: lanterns, carts, picks, and the man who spent his life searching for that giant nugget. \n\nGold Digger is infused with video effects that occur as the reel modifiers are about to take place. Payouts are marked by some fringes and sound explosions, and there are also gold dust floating around. \n\nThe highlight of the game's design section is the banjo theme. It is difficult to imagine a slot of this type without a banjo song, so here it is.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nAs we said, winning results come with three, four, and five matching symbols, and these must occur on the leftmost reel. The high-yield symbols are the prospector, pickaxe, lantern, and gold cart. The low-paying symbols are the playing cards. \n\nFortunately, there is a wild symbol that replaces any symbol except the Scatter symbol, which is a gold nugget. \n\nGold Digger Slot offers wins that are significantly smaller compared to many other slot machines. The difference is that this game comes with Gold Link Respins, and this is where players can score potential big wins. \n\nGold nuggets are responsible for bringing in cash amounts. When five of these symbols land anywhere on the reels, the game triggers the Gold Link Respin, which is a cash collecting bonus feature. \n\nYou are transported to another room in the mine where the reel-set expands, even though it starts with three reels and five rows. During the bonus, the gold nugget and the cash amounts on it are collected. Every nugget that stops on the reels resets the respins to three. \n\nThe goal of the bonus is to get as many of these symbols as possible, but then there are modifiers with blue, green, red, and purple gems that work like this: \n\nThe blue expands the reels upwards; \nThe green increases the cash amounts on the nuggets; \nThe red adds extra respins; \nThe purple increases the x10 multiplier level. \n\nAdditionally, in the base game, the good old gold prospector can trigger three random reel modifiers. When the reel-set is blown up by dynamite, between three and five wilds will appear on that spin. \n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nIf you feel like digging for gold, there are some mining-themed slots to play. The best is the Bonanza Megaways slot produced by Big Time Gaming, which is the most played slot machine ever, without a doubt. Another popular game is Dwarf Mine of Yggdrasil Gaming, which has a similar look.",

These occur completely at random and you will notice them because you will see the man on the left gesturing in surprise. He can throw a pick on the reels to unleash the Wild symbols, and do a few other things that can increase your chances of winning for that round.\n\nThe Gold Digger slot has 5 reels and 20 paylines. Powered by iSoftBet, this mining-themed game can be played from 20 cents per spin on all devices. With an RTP of 96%, there are 3 random-based gameplay features where you can get extra wilds, turn symbols into gold nuggets, and upgrade low-value symbols. In the Gold Link Respins feature, you get even more gold nuggets and therefore bigger cash prizes. To help you out, gems land to add multipliers, increase the values of gold nuggets, assign extra respins, and add more rows. You can win up to 8,230x your bet.\n\nA mining-themed graphic\nThe Gold Digger slot has a mining theme. The banjo playing while the reels spin, we head to the shaft of a mine in search of gold. With the game character to the left of the reels, the symbols appear at the entrance to a mining shaft. It's all very colorful and bright.\n\nSymbols include A, K, Q, and J, which are the classic symbols of Poker cards. You will also come across excavation axes, lanterns, mine carts, and gold seeker Gus himself. The latter pays 7.5x, 12.5x or 25x your stake for 3, 4 or 5 identical symbols in combination. There is an explosion symbol that is the Wild. This replaces all symbols except gold nuggets and gems to create winning combinations.\n\nIf you don't like folk music, you may want to mute the background music. In any case, it is possible to play Gold Digger on desktop, mobile and tablet devices, provided the devices use iOS, Android or Windows technology.\n\nRegarding the slot's design, iSoftBet has done a good job of bringing the best of gold mining activity. The symbols are in line with what you expect: lanterns, carts, picks, and the man who has spent his life looking for that giant nugget.\n\nThe Gold Digger slot has been steeped in video effects that occur when reel modifiers are about to occur. Payouts are marked by some fringes and sound explosions, and there's even gold dust floating around.\n\nThe highlight of the design part of the game is the banjo theme. It's hard to imagine a slot of this kind without a banjo song, so here it is.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nAs we said, winning results are obtained with three, four, and five matching symbols, and these must occur on the leftmost reel. High-yield symbols are the seeker, pickaxe, lantern, and gold cart. Low-paying symbols are Poker cards.\n\nFortunately, there is a wild symbol that replaces any symbol except the Scatter symbol, which is a gold nugget.\n\nThe Gold Digger Slot Machine offers winnings that are significantly smaller than many other Slot Machines. The difference is that this game comes with the Gold Link Respins and that's where players can score potential big wins.\n\nGold nuggets are responsible for bringing cash amounts. When five of these symbols land somewhere on the reels, the game triggers the Gold Link Respin, which is a cash collection bonus feature.\n\nYou are transported to another room inside the mine where the reel-set is expanded, although it begins with three reels and five rows. During the bonus, the gold nugget and cash amounts on it are collected. Each nugget that stops on the reels resets the respins to three.\n\nThe objective of the bonus is to get as many of these symbols as possible, but then there are the modifiers with blue, green, red, and purple gems that work like this:\nBlue expands the reels upward;\nGreen increases the cash amounts on the nuggets;\nRed adds extra respins;\nPurple increases the x10 multiplier level.\n\nIn addition, in the base game, the good old gold seeker can trigger three random reel modifiers. When the reel-set is blown up by dynamite between three and five wilds will appear on that spin.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you feel like digging for gold, there are some mining-themed slots to play. The best is Bonanza Megaways Slot produced by Big Time Gaming which is the most played Slot Machine of all time, without a doubt. Another popular game is Dwarf Mine by Yggdrasil Gaming which looks similar."

You'll also come across mining axes, lanterns, mining carts, and the gold prospector Gus himself. The latter pays 7.5x, 12.5x, or 25x your stake for 3, 4, or 5 of the same symbols in combination. There is an explosion symbol that is the wild. This replaces all symbols except gold nuggets and gems to create winning combinations. \n\nIf you don't like folk music, you may want to mute the background music. In any case, you can play Gold Digger on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices, provided the devices use iOS, Android, or Windows technology. \n\nIn terms of the slot's design, iSoftBet has done a great job of bringing the best of gold mining activity. The symbols are in line with what you'd expect: lanterns, carts, picks, and the man who spent his life searching for that giant nugget. \n\nGold Digger is infused with video effects that occur as the reel modifiers are about to take place. Payouts are marked by some fringes and sound explosions, and there are also gold dust floating around. \n\nThe highlight of the game's design section is the banjo theme. It is difficult to imagine a slot of this type without a banjo song, so here it is.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nAs we said, winning results come with three, four, and five matching symbols, and these must occur on the leftmost reel. The high-yield symbols are the prospector, pickaxe, lantern, and gold cart. The low-paying symbols are the playing cards. \n\nFortunately, there is a wild symbol that replaces any symbol except the Scatter symbol, which is a gold nugget. \n\nGold Digger Slot offers wins that are significantly smaller compared to many other slot machines. The difference is that this game comes with Gold Link Respins, and this is where players can score potential big wins. \n\nGold nuggets are responsible for bringing in cash amounts. When five of these symbols land anywhere on the reels, the game triggers the Gold Link Respin, which is a cash collecting bonus feature. \n\nYou are transported to another room in the mine where the reel-set expands, even though it starts with three reels and five rows. During the bonus, the gold nugget and the cash amounts on it are collected. Every nugget that stops on the reels resets the respins to three. \n\nThe goal of the bonus is to get as many of these symbols as possible, but then there are modifiers with blue, green, red, and purple gems that work like this: \n\nThe blue expands the reels upwards; \nThe green increases the cash amounts on the nuggets; \nThe red adds extra respins; \nThe purple increases the x10 multiplier level. \n\nAdditionally, in the base game, the good old gold prospector can trigger three random reel modifiers. When the reel-set is blown up by dynamite, between three and five wilds will appear on that spin. \n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nIf you feel like digging for gold, there are some mining-themed slots to play. The best is the Bonanza Megaways slot produced by Big Time Gaming, which is the most played slot machine ever, without a doubt. Another popular game is Dwarf Mine of Yggdrasil Gaming, which has a similar look.\n            ",

They occur entirely at random, and you'll notice them because the man on the left reacts with a surprised gesture. He can throw a pick on the reels to unleash wild symbols and do a couple of other things that can increase your chances of winning for that round. \n\nGold Digger has 5 reels and 20 paylines. Powered by iSoftBet, this mining-themed game can be played from 20 cents per spin on all devices. With an RTP of 96%, there are 3 random base game features where you can get extra wilds, transform symbols into gold nuggets, and upgrade low-value symbols. In the Gold Link Respins feature, you get even more gold nuggets and therefore higher cash prizes. To help you out, gems land to add multipliers, increase gold nugget values, assign extra respins, and add more rows. You can win up to 8,230x your bet.\n\nA Mining-Themed Graphics\n\nGold Digger's graphics have a mining theme. With a banjo playing while the reels spin, you head towards a mine shaft in search of gold. With the game's character on the left of the reels, the symbols will appear at the entrance of a mining shaft. It's all very colorful and bright. \n\nThe symbols include A, K, Q, and J, which are the classic playing card symbols. You'll also come across mining axes, lanterns, mining carts, and the gold prospector Gus himself. The latter pays 7.5x, 12.5x, or 25x your stake for 3, 4, or 5 of the same symbols in combination.

This bonus round takes the player to a separate room in the mine where the reel-set expands, starting with three reels and five rows. During the bonus, the gold nuggets and their cash values are collected, and players can earn more respins for every nugget that lands on the reels. There are also blue, green, red, and purple gems that can add multipliers, extra respins, cash increases, and more. Overall, this feature offers a great chance for players to score big wins.\n\nUnique reel modifiers\n\nGold Digger has unique reel modifiers that occur randomly during the base game. These modifiers cause the man on the left of the reels to react with surprise, and they include adding extra wild symbols to the reels and upgrading low-value symbols. These modifiers can increase the chances of winning for that round and add an element of surprise to the gameplay.\n\nRTP\n\nGold Digger has an RTP of 96%, which is the average for online slot games. This means that, on average, for every $100 bet, players can expect to receive $96 in return over many rounds of gameplay.\n\nBase game features\n\nIn addition to the unique reel modifiers, Gold Digger has three random base game features. These features can potentially add extra wilds, transform symbols into gold nuggets, and upgrade lower value symbols to create better winning combinations. These features offer a good chance to boost winnings during regular gameplay.\n\nGameplay mechanics\n\nGold Digger has 5 reels and 20 paylines, with a minimum bet of 20 cents per spin. There are random base game features that can increase the chances of winning, and a Gold Link Respins feature that offers an opportunity for high payouts. The graphics and theme are mining-related, and there is a banjo playing in the background. Gold Digger can be played on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices that use iOS, Android, or Windows technology.\n\nGraphics and theme\n\nGold Digger's graphics and theme feature a mining-related aesthetic. The symbols include traditional playing card symbols, mining axes, lanterns, mining carts, and the gold prospector himself - Gus. There is a Wild symbol and a Scatter symbol, which is a gold nugget. The design of the game is colorful and incorporates sound effects and video effects to enhance the experience for players. The background music is a banjo song that complements the mining theme of the game.\n\nMaximum win potential\n\nGold Digger offers a maximum win potential of 8,230x the bet. This can be achieved through the Gold Link Respins bonus round, which presents players with opportunities to collect high-value gold nuggets and earn multipliers, extra respins, and more. This type of payout can be very attractive to players looking for high-profit games.\n\n        \n            ",

They occur entirely at random, and you'll notice them because the man on the left reacts with a surprised gesture. He can throw a pick on the reels to unleash wild symbols and do a couple of other things that can increase your chances of winning for that round. \n\nGold Digger has 5 reels and 20 paylines. Powered by iSoftBet, this mining-themed game can be played from 20 cents per spin on all devices. With an RTP of 96%, there are 3 random base game features where you can get extra wilds, transform symbols into gold nuggets, and upgrade low-value symbols. In the Gold Link Respins feature, you get even more gold nuggets and therefore higher cash prizes. To help you out, gems land to add multipliers, increase gold nugget values, assign extra respins, and add more rows. You can win up to 8,230x your bet.\n\nA Mining-Themed Graphics\n\nGold Digger's graphics have a mining theme. With a banjo playing while the reels spin, you head towards a mine shaft in search of gold. With the game's character on the left of the reels, the symbols will appear at the entrance of a mining shaft. It's all very colorful and bright. \n\nThe symbols include A, K, Q, and J, which are the classic playing card symbols. You'll also come across mining axes, lanterns, mining carts, and the gold prospector Gus himself. The latter pays 7.5x, 12.5x, or 25x your stake for 3, 4, or 5 of the same symbols in combination. There is an explosion symbol that is the wild. This replaces all symbols except gold nuggets and gems to create winning combinations. \n\nIf you don't like folk music, you may want to mute the background music. In any case, you can play Gold Digger on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices, provided the devices use iOS, Android, or Windows technology. \n\nIn terms of the slot's design, iSoftBet has done a great job of bringing the best of gold mining activity. The symbols are in line with what you'd expect: lanterns, carts, picks, and the man who spent his life searching for that giant nugget. \n\nGold Digger is infused with video effects that occur as the reel modifiers are about to take place. Payouts are marked by some fringes and sound explosions, and there are also gold dust floating around. \n\nThe highlight of the game's design section is the banjo theme. It is difficult to imagine a slot of this type without a banjo song, so here it is.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nAs we said, winning results come with three, four, and five matching symbols, and these must occur on the leftmost reel. The high-yield symbols are the prospector, pickaxe, lantern, and gold cart. The low-paying symbols are the playing cards. \n\nFortunately, there is a wild symbol that replaces any symbol except the Scatter symbol, which is a gold nugget. \n\nGold Digger Slot offers wins that are significantly smaller compared to many other slot machines. The difference is that this game comes with Gold Link Respins, and this is where players can score potential big wins. \n\nGold nuggets are responsible for bringing in cash amounts. When five of these symbols land anywhere on the reels, the game triggers the Gold Link Respin, which is a cash collecting bonus feature. \n\nYou are transported to another room in the mine where the reel-set expands, even though it starts with three reels and five rows. During the bonus, the gold nugget and the cash amounts on it are collected. Every nugget that stops on the reels resets the respins to three. \n\nThe goal of the bonus is to get as many of these symbols as possible, but then there are modifiers with blue, green, red, and purple gems that work like this: \n\nThe blue expands the reels upwards; \nThe green increases the cash amounts on the nuggets; \nThe red adds extra respins; \nThe purple increases the x10 multiplier level. \n\nAdditionally, in the base game, the good old gold prospector can trigger three random reel modifiers. When the reel-set is blown up by dynamite, between three and five wilds will appear on that spin. \n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nIf you feel like digging for gold, there are some mining-themed slots to play. The best is the Bonanza Megaways slot produced by Big Time Gaming, which is the most played slot machine ever, without a doubt. Another popular game is Dwarf Mine of Yggdrasil Gaming, which has a similar look.\n            ",
