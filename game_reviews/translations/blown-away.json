            "response": "Blown Away\nFrom the depths of the mainland comes a slot game that has survived a shipwreck and emerges alive to offer an exciting adventure on three rows and five reels.\n\nThe Lightning Box is the slot provider responsible for this release, which, like its previous online slots, is just as engaging and potentially lucrative. The theme of the Blown Away slot revolves around the crew of a fishing boat led by an anthropomorphic whale.\n\nWins are made with three symbols of the same type that must fall on the leftmost reel and extend to the right. There are 25 always active paylines that can lead to more than one win.\n\nThere are also extras that can increase the chances of winning prizes. One of these symbols is the whale itself, which is wild, and there is the lightning symbol (the company logo), which is the free spring that triggers the scatter.\n\nBlown Away is a fun-looking slot machine from Lightning Box, where the developer has implemented a new theme, revolving around animal characters stranded on a tropical island, the result of a storm at sea. I think they could have done certain things better, but this slot includes some good features, and overall it is worth examining.\n\nDream graphics\nAs in previous games like Respin Racer and Astro Cat, players are treated to lush graphics. Lightning Box as a company has a recognizable style in the way they draw symbols and the layout all around, and this makes the reel adventure visually enjoyable.\n\nThe symbols in Blown Away slots are nothing short of comic book-like. There is a scientist lizard, and a monkey whose face seems familiar to me, and a skipper whale that alludes to Gilligan's island.\n\nWinning results are achieved with a band, namely with gold coins that pour out from under the reel and during the reel adventure there are nautical notes and ocean sounds.\n\nThere are not many slot machines that will use Robinson Crusoe-inspired stories for their designs, but that's what Blown Away seems to be doing. Instead of having the usual humans as main characters, they rely on animals and birds, one different in each symbol that has a high value or feature. Low-value game symbols still have real images, but the better ones will have seals, monkeys, penguins, seagulls and lizards.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe thunder symbol is the game's scatter and falls on odd reels (one, three, and five). This symbol triggers the 10 free spins bonus, which comes with a kicker.\n\nThere is a high chance that the tornado symbol will fall on the reel. If this happens, the lowest real symbol will be removed from the game.\n\nThroughout the bonus, players can get the cow meter in the upper landing by landing the tornado symbol. Each cow icon lit is equal to 1 times the multiplier. There are also multipliers that can calculate winnings with a factor of up to 7 times the bet.\n\nThe Seal Wild is present in the game, and this can be used to complete various types of regular combinations. As a substitute, it can be placed next to any regular symbol, and it will form a combo with it.\n\nRespins triggered by a tornado will be activated when the required symbol appears on the reels. The Tornado is another wild symbol, but it behaves differently. It only appears on reel 5, and brings the Tornado Respin. With each activated respin, a different low Royal value will be removed from the reels, starting from the first. It starts with 9, then removes 10 if there is an extra tornado landing, and so on.\n\nAdditionally, there are boat scatters, which must land on reels three times, all in one spin. This triggers 10 free spins and pays up to 150 times the payout. In this mode, you have the chance to collect Cows by landing Tornadoes on the reels, which in turn can increase the multiplier for your wins up to 7 times. The multiplier can also be increased by the Tornado symbols. These will also remove a real symbol of the lowest value, with each appearance.\n\nYou have the chance to choose a bet for the next spin, and it can be from €0.25, or up to €200. The betting line seems to have a range from €0.01 to €8 and is automatically selected as the total bet changes. In either case, the game gives you 25 active lines for each spin.\n\nAbout 900 times the bet is the highest payout the game will give to the player. It is mostly a medium volatility slot, which means there will be slots with the same amount of risk, but with better payouts. An RTP of 95.70% also tells us that there is room for better rewards.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nLightning Box games tend to offer slots with high winning potential - Eagle Sun is recommended as it is possible to win up to 56,000 times the bet on each free spin playing with 80 paylines. In the base game or in the respin feature, it is still possible to win up to 28,000 times the bets.",

Blown Away, the latest release from Lightning Box, is as engaging and potentially lucrative as its previous online slots. The game revolves around the crew of a fishing boat led by an anthropomorphic walrus. Wins are made by landing three symbols of the same kind that must fall on the leftmost reel and extend to the right. There are 25 always-active paylines that can lead to more than one win. \n\nBlown Away is a fun-looking slot machine from Lightning Box where the developer has implemented a new theme, revolving around animal characters that are abandoned on a tropical island, the result of a storm at sea. Rather than having the usual human characters, they rely on animals and birds, each different in every symbol that has a high value or feature. The game is visually pleasing from the lush graphics to the sound effects that enhance the nautical adventure on the reels. \n\nThe Thunder symbol is the game's scatter and lands on odd reels (one, three, and five), triggering the bonus of 10 free spins that come with a kicker. There is a high chance that the Tornado symbol will land on the reel. If this happens, the lowest-paying real symbol will be removed from the game. During the bonus round, players can get the cow meter on top by landing the Tornado symbol. Each lit cow icon equals a 1x multiplier. In addition, there are multipliers that can calculate wins with a factor of up to 7x on the bet. \n\nThe Seal Wild is also present in the game, and it can be used to complete various types of regular combinations. As a substitute, it can be placed next to any regular symbol and form a combo with it. \n\nBlown Away is a medium-volatility slot game with an RTP of 95.70%, indicating the possibility of better rewards. The maximum win that the game will reach when awarding players is about 900 times the bet. Eagle Sun, another Lightning Box game, is recommended as it offers high potential for winnings, with up to 56,000 times the bet on each free spin played with 80 payment lines. \n\nIn summary, with its eye-catching graphics, amusing animal characters, and potentially rewarding bonuses, Blown Away is definitely worth examining for experienced gamblers who enjoy an adventure-packed slot game."

The theme of the Blown Away slot revolves around the crew of a fishing boat led by an anthropomorphic whale.\n\nWins are made with three symbols of the same type that must fall on the leftmost reel and extend to the right. There are 25 always active paylines that can lead to more than one win.\n\nThere are also extras that can increase the chances of winning prizes. One of these symbols is the whale itself, which is wild, and there is the lightning symbol (the company logo), which is the free spring that triggers the scatter.\n\nBlown Away is a fun-looking slot machine from Lightning Box, where the developer has implemented a new theme, revolving around animal characters stranded on a tropical island, the result of a storm at sea. I think they could have done certain things better, but this slot includes some good features, and overall it is worth examining.\n\nDream graphics\nAs in previous games like Respin Racer and Astro Cat, players are treated to lush graphics. Lightning Box as a company has a recognizable style in the way they draw symbols and the layout all around, and this makes the reel adventure visually enjoyable.\n\nThe symbols in Blown Away slots are nothing short of comic book-like. There is a scientist lizard, and a monkey whose face seems familiar to me, and a skipper whale that alludes to Gilligan's island.\n\nWinning results are achieved with a band, namely with gold coins that pour out from under the reel and during the reel adventure there are nautical notes and ocean sounds.\n\nThere are not many slot machines that will use Robinson Crusoe-inspired stories for their designs, but that's what Blown Away seems to be doing. Instead of having the usual humans as main characters, they rely on animals and birds, one different in each symbol that has a high value or feature. Low-value game symbols still have real images, but the better ones will have seals, monkeys, penguins, seagulls and lizards.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe thunder symbol is the game's scatter and falls on odd reels (one, three, and five). This symbol triggers the 10 free spins bonus, which comes with a kicker.\n\nThere is a high chance that the tornado symbol will fall on the reel. If this happens, the lowest real symbol will be removed from the game.\n\nThroughout the bonus, players can get the cow meter in the upper landing by landing the tornado symbol. Each cow icon lit is equal to 1 times the multiplier. There are also multipliers that can calculate winnings with a factor of up to 7 times the bet.\n\nThe Seal Wild is present in the game, and this can be used to complete various types of regular combinations. As a substitute, it can be placed next to any regular symbol, and it will form a combo with it.\n\nRespins triggered by a tornado will be activated when the required symbol appears on the reels. The Tornado is another wild symbol, but it behaves differently. It only appears on reel 5, and brings the Tornado Respin. With each activated respin, a different low Royal value will be removed from the reels, starting from the first. It starts with 9, then removes 10 if there is an extra tornado landing, and so on.\n\nAdditionally, there are boat scatters, which must land on reels three times, all in one spin. This triggers 10 free spins and pays up to 150 times the payout. In this mode, you have the chance to collect Cows by landing Tornadoes on the reels, which in turn can increase the multiplier for your wins up to 7 times. The multiplier can also be increased by the Tornado symbols. These will also remove a real symbol of the lowest value, with each appearance.\n\nYou have the chance to choose a bet for the next spin, and it can be from €0.25, or up to €200. The betting line seems to have a range from €0.01 to €8 and is automatically selected as the total bet changes. In either case, the game gives you 25 active lines for each spin.\n\nAbout 900 times the bet is the highest payout the game will give to the player. It is mostly a medium volatility slot, which means there will be slots with the same amount of risk, but with better payouts. An RTP of 95.70% also tells us that there is room for better rewards.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nLightning Box games tend to offer slots with high winning potential - Eagle Sun is recommended as it is possible to win up to 56,000 times the bet on each free spin playing with 80 paylines. In the base game or in the respin feature, it is still possible to win up to 28,000 times the bets.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nBlown Away gameplay\nAnimal-themed slots\nPaylines and winning combinations\nWild and scatter symbols\nBonus rounds and free spins\nVolatility and RTP\nGraphics and design\nPayout and jackpots\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Blown Away\nFrom the depths of the mainland comes a slot game that has survived a shipwreck and emerges alive to offer an exciting adventure on three rows and five reels.\n\nThe Lightning Box is the slot provider responsible for this release, which, like its previous online slots, is just as engaging and potentially lucrative. The theme of the Blown Away slot revolves around the crew of a fishing boat led by an anthropomorphic whale.\n\nWins are made with three symbols of the same type that must fall on the leftmost reel and extend to the right. There are 25 always active paylines that can lead to more than one win.\n\nThere are also extras that can increase the chances of winning prizes. One of these symbols is the whale itself, which is wild, and there is the lightning symbol (the company logo), which is the free spring that triggers the scatter.\n\nBlown Away is a fun-looking slot machine from Lightning Box, where the developer has implemented a new theme, revolving around animal characters stranded on a tropical island, the result of a storm at sea. I think they could have done certain things better, but this slot includes some good features, and overall it is worth examining.\n\nDream graphics\nAs in previous games like Respin Racer and Astro Cat, players are treated to lush graphics. Lightning Box as a company has a recognizable style in the way they draw symbols and the layout all around, and this makes the reel adventure visually enjoyable.\n\nThe symbols in Blown Away slots are nothing short of comic book-like. There is a scientist lizard, and a monkey whose face seems familiar to me, and a skipper whale that alludes to Gilligan's island.\n\nWinning results are achieved with a band, namely with gold coins that pour out from under the reel and during the reel adventure there are nautical notes and ocean sounds.\n\nThere are not many slot machines that will use Robinson Crusoe-inspired stories for their designs, but that's what Blown Away seems to be doing. Instead of having the usual humans as main characters, they rely on animals and birds, one different in each symbol that has a high value or feature. Low-value game symbols still have real images, but the better ones will have seals, monkeys, penguins, seagulls and lizards.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe thunder symbol is the game's scatter and falls on odd reels (one, three, and five). This symbol triggers the 10 free spins bonus, which comes with a kicker.\n\nThere is a high chance that the tornado symbol will fall on the reel. If this happens, the lowest real symbol will be removed from the game.\n\nThroughout the bonus, players can get the cow meter in the upper landing by landing the tornado symbol. Each cow icon lit is equal to 1 times the multiplier. There are also multipliers that can calculate winnings with a factor of up to 7 times the bet.\n\nThe Seal Wild is present in the game, and this can be used to complete various types of regular combinations. As a substitute, it can be placed next to any regular symbol, and it will form a combo with it.\n\nRespins triggered by a tornado will be activated when the required symbol appears on the reels. The Tornado is another wild symbol, but it behaves differently. It only appears on reel 5, and brings the Tornado Respin. With each activated respin, a different low Royal value will be removed from the reels, starting from the first. It starts with 9, then removes 10 if there is an extra tornado landing, and so on.\n\nAdditionally, there are boat scatters, which must land on reels three times, all in one spin. This triggers 10 free spins and pays up to 150 times the payout. In this mode, you have the chance to collect Cows by landing Tornadoes on the reels, which in turn can increase the multiplier for your wins up to 7 times. The multiplier can also be increased by the Tornado symbols. These will also remove a real symbol of the lowest value, with each appearance.\n\nYou have the chance to choose a bet for the next spin, and it can be from €0.25, or up to €200. The betting line seems to have a range from €0.01 to €8 and is automatically selected as the total bet changes. In either case, the game gives you 25 active lines for each spin.\n\nAbout 900 times the bet is the highest payout the game will give to the player. It is mostly a medium volatility slot, which means there will be slots with the same amount of risk, but with better payouts. An RTP of 95.70% also tells us that there is room for better rewards.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nLightning Box games tend to offer slots with high winning potential - Eagle Sun is recommended as it is possible to win up to 56,000 times the bet on each free spin playing with 80 paylines. In the base game or in the respin feature, it is still possible to win up to 28,000 times the bets.\n            ",

Secondly, the <strong>Seal Wild</strong> can be used to complete various regular combinations and really seal the deal for you. And finally, we have the <strong>Tornado</strong>, which is another wild symbol that behaves a little differently. This fierce force of nature expands vertically and horizontally, and can multiply your win by up to 7 times. Talk about a twister of excitement!</p>\n\n  <p>Let's not forget about the <strong>scatter symbols</strong>, because they are truly electrifying. The <strong>thunder symbol</strong> is a scatter symbol and triggers the <strong>10 free spins bonus</strong>, which comes with a kicker. During these free spins, all Whale Wilds become sticky and stay on the reels for the duration of the bonus, increasing your chances of winning big time. And if that's not enough, there are also boat scatters that trigger 10 free spins and pay up to 150 times the payout - now that really rocks the boat! </p>\n\n  <p>So if you're ready to be <em>blown away</em> by a slot game that's jam-packed with wilds, scatters and free spins, then give Blown Away a spin.

Talk about a twister of excitement!</p>\n\n  <p>Let's not forget about the <strong>scatter symbols</strong>, because they are truly electrifying. The <strong>thunder symbol</strong> is a scatter symbol and triggers the <strong>10 free spins bonus</strong>, which comes with a kicker. During these free spins, all Whale Wilds become sticky and stay on the reels for the duration of the bonus, increasing your chances of winning big time. And if that's not enough, there are also boat scatters that trigger 10 free spins and pay up to 150 times the payout - now that really rocks the boat! </p>\n\n  <p>So if you're ready to be <em>blown away</em> by a slot game that's jam-packed with wilds, scatters and free spins, then give Blown Away a spin. You might just be in for a whale of a time!</p>\"\n}"

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a length of 15 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\nBlown Away is an engaging slot game with an animal-inspired theme that revolves around the crew of a fishing boat led by an anthropomorphic whale. Wins are made with three symbols of the same type that must fall on the leftmost reel and extend to the right. There are 25 always active paylines that can lead to more than one win. There are also extras that can increase the chances of winning prizes, such as the whale symbol, which is wild, and the lightning symbol, which is the free spin that triggers the scatter.\n\nTheme\n\nBlown Away has a unique theme revolving around animal characters stranded on a tropical island, resulting from a storm at sea. The symbol designs are comic book-like, featuring a scientist lizard, monkey, skipper whale, and more. The game's design is visually enjoyable and has a recognizable style that Lightning Box is known for.\n\nPaylines\n\nBlown Away features 25 always active paylines extending from the leftmost reel to the right. These paylines can lead to multiple wins, making the game even more exciting.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nBlown Away has a maximum payout of about 900 times the bet, making it a medium volatility slot. There are other Lightning Box games that offer higher winning potential, such as Eagle Sun, which can pay up to 56,000 times the bet on each free spin playing with 80 paylines. However, Blown Away still offers a decent winning potential for players.\n\nBonuses\n\nBlown Away offers various bonuses to increase the chances of winning prizes. The thunder symbol is the game's scatter, and it triggers the 10 free spins bonus, which comes with a kicker. There is also a high chance that the tornado symbol will fall on the reel, which removes the lowest real symbol from the game. Moreover, players can collect Cows in the bonus mode and increase the multiplier up to 7 times by landing Tornadoes on the reels. The Seal Wild can be used to complete various types of regular combinations and can be placed next to any regular symbol to form a combo.\n\nVolatility\n\nBlown Away is a medium volatility slot, which means there will be slots with the same amount of risk but with better payouts. The game's RTP of 95.70% also tells us that there is room for better rewards.\n\nRTP\n\nBlown Away has an RTP of 95.70%, which is slightly lower than the industry average. However, this is still a decent RTP that provides players with a chance to win decent rewards.\n\nGraphics\n\nBlown Away has dream graphics, featuring lush and comic book-like designs that give the game a unique and enjoyable visual style. The game layout is impressive, and it includes nautical notes and ocean sounds that make the experience more immersive. Overall, the game provides players with an engaging, visually appealing, and entertaining slot experience.\n\n        \n            ",

It's a video slot with three rows and five reels, and players use 25 always active paylines that can lead to more than one win.\n\nAnimal-themed slots\n\nBlown Away offers a unique animal-themed slot revolving around animal characters stranded on a tropical island, the result of a storm at sea. Instead of using humans as main characters, the game relies on animals and birds, one different in each symbol that has a high value or feature.\n\nPaylines and winning combinations\n\nTo create a winning combination in Blown Away, you must have three symbols of the same type on the leftmost reel that extend to the right. You can achieve multiple winning results with a band, namely with gold coins that pour out from under the reel.\n\nWild and scatter symbols\n\nBlown Away has three types of wild symbols: The Whale is wild, and the Seal Wild can be used to complete various regular combinations. The Tornado is another wild symbol, but it behaves differently. The thunder symbol is a scatter symbol and triggers the 10 free spins bonus which comes with a kicker. There are also boat scatters, which triggers 10 free spins and pays up to 150 times the payout.\n\nBonus rounds and free spins\n\nBlown Away offers different bonus rounds and free spins. Respins triggered by a tornado will be activated when the required symbol appears on the reels. With each activated respin, a different low Royal value will be removed from the reels. Additionally, players can get the cow meter in the upper landing by landing the tornado symbol. Each cow icon lit is equal to 1 times the multiplier. The multiplier level can be increased up to 7 times the bet, which also removes a real symbol of the lowest value with each tornado symbol appearance.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nBlown Away is considered a medium volatility slot game with an RTP of 95.70%, which means there is room for better rewards. Other similar slot machines in the Lightning Box games tend to offer slots with high winning potential like Eagle Sun, which can pay up to 56,000 times the bet on each free spin playing with 80 paylines. In the base game or in the respin feature, it is still possible to win up to 28,000 times the bets.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nBlown Away, as with other games from Lightning Box, has excellent graphics. Players are treated to lush visuals, and the symbols in the game are comic book-like and memorable. There is no shortage of attention to details in the reel adventure, and nautical notes and ocean sounds add an extra layer of immersion.\n\nPayout and jackpots\n\nThe highest payout available in Blown Away is about 900 times the bet. Players can bet a minimum of €0.25 and a maximum of €200. \n\n        \n            ",

The theme of the Blown Away slot revolves around the crew of a fishing boat led by an anthropomorphic whale.\n\nWins are made with three symbols of the same type that must fall on the leftmost reel and extend to the right. There are 25 always active paylines that can lead to more than one win.\n\nThere are also extras that can increase the chances of winning prizes. One of these symbols is the whale itself, which is wild, and there is the lightning symbol (the company logo), which is the free spring that triggers the scatter.\n\nBlown Away is a fun-looking slot machine from Lightning Box, where the developer has implemented a new theme, revolving around animal characters stranded on a tropical island, the result of a storm at sea. I think they could have done certain things better, but this slot includes some good features, and overall it is worth examining.\n\nDream graphics\nAs in previous games like Respin Racer and Astro Cat, players are treated to lush graphics. Lightning Box as a company has a recognizable style in the way they draw symbols and the layout all around, and this makes the reel adventure visually enjoyable.\n\nThe symbols in Blown Away slots are nothing short of comic book-like. There is a scientist lizard, and a monkey whose face seems familiar to me, and a skipper whale that alludes to Gilligan's island.\n\nWinning results are achieved with a band, namely with gold coins that pour out from under the reel and during the reel adventure there are nautical notes and ocean sounds.\n\nThere are not many slot machines that will use Robinson Crusoe-inspired stories for their designs, but that's what Blown Away seems to be doing. Instead of having the usual humans as main characters, they rely on animals and birds, one different in each symbol that has a high value or feature. Low-value game symbols still have real images, but the better ones will have seals, monkeys, penguins, seagulls and lizards.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe thunder symbol is the game's scatter and falls on odd reels (one, three, and five). This symbol triggers the 10 free spins bonus, which comes with a kicker.\n\nThere is a high chance that the tornado symbol will fall on the reel. If this happens, the lowest real symbol will be removed from the game.\n\nThroughout the bonus, players can get the cow meter in the upper landing by landing the tornado symbol. Each cow icon lit is equal to 1 times the multiplier. There are also multipliers that can calculate winnings with a factor of up to 7 times the bet.\n\nThe Seal Wild is present in the game, and this can be used to complete various types of regular combinations. As a substitute, it can be placed next to any regular symbol, and it will form a combo with it.\n\nRespins triggered by a tornado will be activated when the required symbol appears on the reels. The Tornado is another wild symbol, but it behaves differently. It only appears on reel 5, and brings the Tornado Respin. With each activated respin, a different low Royal value will be removed from the reels, starting from the first. It starts with 9, then removes 10 if there is an extra tornado landing, and so on.\n\nAdditionally, there are boat scatters, which must land on reels three times, all in one spin. This triggers 10 free spins and pays up to 150 times the payout. In this mode, you have the chance to collect Cows by landing Tornadoes on the reels, which in turn can increase the multiplier for your wins up to 7 times. The multiplier can also be increased by the Tornado symbols. These will also remove a real symbol of the lowest value, with each appearance.\n\nYou have the chance to choose a bet for the next spin, and it can be from €0.25, or up to €200. The betting line seems to have a range from €0.01 to €8 and is automatically selected as the total bet changes. In either case, the game gives you 25 active lines for each spin.\n\nAbout 900 times the bet is the highest payout the game will give to the player. It is mostly a medium volatility slot, which means there will be slots with the same amount of risk, but with better payouts. An RTP of 95.70% also tells us that there is room for better rewards.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nLightning Box games tend to offer slots with high winning potential - Eagle Sun is recommended as it is possible to win up to 56,000 times the bet on each free spin playing with 80 paylines. In the base game or in the respin feature, it is still possible to win up to 28,000 times the bets.\n            ",

With each activated respin, a different low Royal value will be removed from the reels, starting from the first. It starts with 9, then removes 10 if there is an extra tornado landing, and so on.\n\nAdditionally, there are boat scatters, which must land on reels three times, all in one spin. This triggers 10 free spins and pays up to 150 times the payout. In this mode, you have the chance to collect Cows by landing Tornadoes on the reels, which in turn can increase the multiplier for your wins up to 7 times. The multiplier can also be increased by the Tornado symbols. These will also remove a real symbol of the lowest value, with each appearance.\n\nYou have the chance to choose a bet for the next spin, and it can be from €0.25, or up to €200. The betting line seems to have a range from €0.01 to €8 and is automatically selected as the total bet changes. In either case, the game gives you 25 active lines for each spin.\n\nAbout 900 times the bet is the highest payout the game will give to the player. It is mostly a medium volatility slot, which means there will be slots with the same amount of risk, but with better payouts. An RTP of 95.70% also tells us that there is room for better rewards.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nLightning Box games tend to offer slots with high winning potential - Eagle Sun is recommended as it is possible to win up to 56,000 times the bet on each free spin playing with 80 paylines. In the base game or in the respin feature, it is still possible to win up to 28,000 times the bets.\n            ",

The theme of the Blown Away slot revolves around the crew of a fishing boat led by an anthropomorphic whale.\n\nWins are made with three symbols of the same type that must fall on the leftmost reel and extend to the right. There are 25 always active paylines that can lead to more than one win.\n\nThere are also extras that can increase the chances of winning prizes. One of these symbols is the whale itself, which is wild, and there is the lightning symbol (the company logo), which is the free spring that triggers the scatter.\n\nBlown Away is a fun-looking slot machine from Lightning Box, where the developer has implemented a new theme, revolving around animal characters stranded on a tropical island, the result of a storm at sea. I think they could have done certain things better, but this slot includes some good features, and overall it is worth examining.\n\nDream graphics\nAs in previous games like Respin Racer and Astro Cat, players are treated to lush graphics. Lightning Box as a company has a recognizable style in the way they draw symbols and the layout all around, and this makes the reel adventure visually enjoyable.\n\nThe symbols in Blown Away slots are nothing short of comic book-like. There is a scientist lizard, and a monkey whose face seems familiar to me, and a skipper whale that alludes to Gilligan's island.\n\nWinning results are achieved with a band, namely with gold coins that pour out from under the reel and during the reel adventure there are nautical notes and ocean sounds.\n\nThere are not many slot machines that will use Robinson Crusoe-inspired stories for their designs, but that's what Blown Away seems to be doing. Instead of having the usual humans as main characters, they rely on animals and birds, one different in each symbol that has a high value or feature. Low-value game symbols still have real images, but the better ones will have seals, monkeys, penguins, seagulls and lizards.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe thunder symbol is the game's scatter and falls on odd reels (one, three, and five). This symbol triggers the 10 free spins bonus, which comes with a kicker.\n\nThere is a high chance that the tornado symbol will fall on the reel. If this happens, the lowest real symbol will be removed from the game.\n\nThroughout the bonus, players can get the cow meter in the upper landing by landing the tornado symbol. Each cow icon lit is equal to 1 times the multiplier. There are also multipliers that can calculate winnings with a factor of up to 7 times the bet.\n\nThe Seal Wild is present in the game, and this can be used to complete various types of regular combinations. As a substitute, it can be placed next to any regular symbol, and it will form a combo with it.\n\nRespins triggered by a tornado will be activated when the required symbol appears on the reels. The Tornado is another wild symbol, but it behaves differently. It only appears on reel 5, and brings the Tornado Respin. With each activated respin, a different low Royal value will be removed from the reels, starting from the first. It starts with 9, then removes 10 if there is an extra tornado landing, and so on.\n\nAdditionally, there are boat scatters, which must land on reels three times, all in one spin. This triggers 10 free spins and pays up to 150 times the payout. In this mode, you have the chance to collect Cows by landing Tornadoes on the reels, which in turn can increase the multiplier for your wins up to 7 times. The multiplier can also be increased by the Tornado symbols. These will also remove a real symbol of the lowest value, with each appearance.\n\nYou have the chance to choose a bet for the next spin, and it can be from €0.25, or up to €200. The betting line seems to have a range from €0.01 to €8 and is automatically selected as the total bet changes. In either case, the game gives you 25 active lines for each spin.\n\nAbout 900 times the bet is the highest payout the game will give to the player.
