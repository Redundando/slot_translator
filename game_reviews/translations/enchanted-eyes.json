You'll receive your random prizes at the end of the Big Hit feature when you can also access your free games.\n\nExtra Big Hit Feature\nThe Extra Big Hit feature can be randomly activated at any point in a payline game, unless you're using the Big Hit feature or Grand Prize.

The bonus prizes are Mini, Minor, and Major, each with a higher total prize. The type of bonus you win is random, but your chance of matching the Bonus symbol increases with a higher bet.\n\nEnchanted Eyes' Free Games\nFree games can be awarded from the Big Hit feature and the Extra Hit Big Hit feature. This includes one or two games per Scatter in Big Hit and nine to 18 free games from the Extra Hit Big Hit feature. During the free games, both Princess Wild and Princess Bonus will appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, but not on reels 1 and 5. The Princess Bonus can substitute any other symbol, while the Princess Wild can substitute any symbol except the Bonus Princess. There's also a new paytable, often with higher prizes for each symbol.

Moreover, this title is part of Ainsworth's Big Hit Bonanza games. This means it's packed with bonuses and extra ways to win, including respins and multipliers. These features ensure that this is not just a mere Egyptian-themed slot, but a truly varied and exciting experience for any player! Learn more in the following paragraphs.\n\nTheme of Enchanted Eyes\nEvery slot machine fan must have visited ancient Egypt while playing online. The mysterious atmosphere and the precious treasures hidden in the pharaohs' pyramids make the games always very exciting. In this slot in particular, from the moment the loading screen opens, you will be captivated by the enchanting graphics of a princess' magnetic gaze. The nighttime setting and reels covered with a kind of yellowed papyrus complete the very well-crafted layout. Other symbols include a multitude of sparkling gold treasures.\n\nHow to Play Enchanted Eyes?\nAt first glance, this is a rather standard slot. It has 5 reels that offer 25 paylines. After using the bet controller in the bottom right of the screen, using the arrows on either side of the current bet or pressing the Max Bet button, to choose the bet between 1 and 40, you can click Spin. If you don't feel like sitting and having to constantly click, you can use the autoplay feature. After choosing your bet at your preferred level, you can set the autoplay game to play up to 100 spins. The RTP for Enchanted Eyes is stated to be 94.31%, which means you could win € 94.31 for every € 100 you bet.\n\nWhat are the special symbols to watch out for?\n\nThe Princess – This icon represents the Wild symbol and can take the place of any other icon to help you complete a winning line. The only exceptions are the bonus and scatter. The princess never appears on the first reel, only on reels 2, 3, 4, 5 and is exclusive to pay-to-play games;\nThe Egyptian Pyramid - This symbol is the Scatter and is exclusive to pay-to-play games, for the second, third, fourth reels. It takes six or more scatters to activate the Pyramid Scatter wins and Big Hit feature;\nBonus Symbol – It appears on reels 2, 3, 4. Match three of these icons and one of the available bonuses will be activated. Bonus symbols increase if you increase your bet, so choose your play value carefully.\n\nWhat are Enchanted Eyes' bonus features?\nAs already anticipated, being this slot one of the Big Hit Bonanza games, it is stuffed with numerous bonuses to increase both enthusiasm and winnings. You can activate them by hitting at least six scatters, and there is always a chance to reactivate them while the bonuses are in play. During bonus rounds, the standard paytable is not applied.\n\nWhat is the Big Hit Feature?\nIn the Big Hit feature, you will be awarded one or two free games for every scatter that activated the feature. These free games will be added to a counter. You will also be given 3 free respins. The Big Hit feature ends when you have used up all your free spins or win the Grand Prize. During the Big Hit feature, all of your triggering scatters will be locked in place. The same thing will happen to any new scatter triggered during the feature, which will also restore your free respins to three. Each new scatter has its own random prize of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25 or 50. These will be added to the winnings counter. You'll receive your random prizes at the end of the Big Hit feature, when you'll also be able to access your free games.\n\nBig Hit Extra Bonus Feature\nThe Big Hit extra bonus feature can be randomly activated at any point in the pay-to-play game unless you're using the Big Hit feature or the Grand Prize. As with the Big Hit, it also comes with 3 respins. Additionally, a giant scatter will appear, for a total of nine scatters, on the second, third, and fourth reels. The new scatters that appear during the feature will be locked in place, each of which will award a random prize of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, or 50 to add to the winnings counter. For the Big Hit extra bonus feature, you can win your bet multiplied by two and between nine and 18 free games. As in the Big Hit feature, these free games will be added to the free game counter to be awarded at the end of the Big Hit extra bonus feature.\n\nIMPORTANT! - You can get bonus prizes by matching the bonus symbol at least three times. The bonus prizes are Mini, Minor and Major, each with a higher total prize. The type of bonus you win is random, but your chance of matching the bonus symbol increases if you have a higher bet.\n\nEnchanted Eyes Free Games\nFree games can be awarded from the Big Hit feature and the Extra Hit Big Hit feature. This is worth one or two games per scatter in the Big Hit and nine to 18 free games from the Extra Hit Big Hit feature. During the free games, both Princess Wild and Princess Bonus will appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, but not on reels 1 and 5. The Princess Bonus can also replace any other symbol, while the Princess Wild can replace any symbol except the Bonus Princess. There is also a new paytable, often with higher prizes for each symbol. Bonuses can be activated in free games by hitting the Bonus Princess, similar to the bonus in the base game. For four or five Bonus Princess symbols, win the mini bonus. For six or seven, win the minor bonus. The maximum requires eight or nine.\n            ",

Moreover, this title is part of Ainsworth's Big Hit Bonanza games. This means it's packed with bonuses and extra ways to win, including respins and multipliers. These features ensure that this is not just a mere Egyptian-themed slot, but a truly varied and exciting experience for any player! Learn more in the following paragraphs.\n\nTheme of Enchanted Eyes\nEvery slot machine fan must have visited ancient Egypt while playing online. The mysterious atmosphere and the precious treasures hidden in the pharaohs' pyramids make the games always very exciting. In this slot in particular, from the moment the loading screen opens, you will be captivated by the enchanting graphics of a princess' magnetic gaze. The nighttime setting and reels covered with a kind of yellowed papyrus complete the very well-crafted layout. Other symbols include a multitude of sparkling gold treasures.\n\nHow to Play Enchanted Eyes?\nAt first glance, this is a rather standard slot. It has 5 reels that offer 25 paylines. After using the bet controller in the bottom right of the screen, using the arrows on either side of the current bet or pressing the Max Bet button, to choose the bet between 1 and 40, you can click Spin. If you don't feel like sitting and having to constantly click, you can use the autoplay feature. After choosing your bet at your preferred level, you can set the autoplay game to play up to 100 spins. The RTP for Enchanted Eyes is stated to be 94.31%, which means you could win € 94.31 for every € 100 you bet.\n\nWhat are the special symbols to watch out for?\n\nThe Princess – This icon represents the Wild symbol and can take the place of any other icon to help you complete a winning line. The only exceptions are the bonus and scatter. The princess never appears on the first reel, only on reels 2, 3, 4, 5 and is exclusive to pay-to-play games;\nThe Egyptian Pyramid - This symbol is the Scatter and is exclusive to pay-to-play games, for the second, third, fourth reels. It takes six or more scatters to activate the Pyramid Scatter wins and Big Hit feature;\nBonus Symbol – It appears on reels 2, 3, 4. Match three of these icons and one of the available bonuses will be activated. Bonus symbols increase if you increase your bet, so choose your play value carefully.\n\nWhat are Enchanted Eyes' bonus features?\nAs already anticipated, being this slot one of the Big Hit Bonanza games, it is stuffed with numerous bonuses to increase both enthusiasm and winnings. You can activate them by hitting at least six scatters, and there is always a chance to reactivate them while the bonuses are in play. During bonus rounds, the standard paytable is not applied.\n\nWhat is the Big Hit Feature?\nIn the Big Hit feature, you will be awarded one or two free games for every scatter that activated the feature. These free games will be added to a counter. You will also be given 3 free respins. The Big Hit feature ends when you have used up all your free spins or win the Grand Prize. During the Big Hit feature, all of your triggering scatters will be locked in place. The same thing will happen to any new scatter triggered during the feature, which will also restore your free respins to three. Each new scatter has its own random prize of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25 or 50. These will be added to the winnings counter. You'll receive your random prizes at the end of the Big Hit feature, when you'll also be able to access your free games.\n\nBig Hit Extra Bonus Feature\nThe Big Hit extra bonus feature can be randomly activated at any point in the pay-to-play game unless you're using the Big Hit feature or the Grand Prize. As with the Big Hit, it also comes with 3 respins. Additionally, a giant scatter will appear, for a total of nine scatters, on the second, third, and fourth reels. The new scatters that appear during the feature will be locked in place, each of which will award a random prize of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, or 50 to add to the winnings counter. For the Big Hit extra bonus feature, you can win your bet multiplied by two and between nine and 18 free games. As in the Big Hit feature, these free games will be added to the free game counter to be awarded at the end of the Big Hit extra bonus feature.\n\nIMPORTANT! - You can get bonus prizes by matching the bonus symbol at least three times. The bonus prizes are Mini, Minor and Major, each with a higher total prize. The type of bonus you win is random, but your chance of matching the bonus symbol increases if you have a higher bet.\n\nEnchanted Eyes Free Games\nFree games can be awarded from the Big Hit feature and the Extra Hit Big Hit feature. This is worth one or two games per scatter in the Big Hit and nine to 18 free games from the Extra Hit Big Hit feature. During the free games, both Princess Wild and Princess Bonus will appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, but not on reels 1 and 5. The Princess Bonus can also replace any other symbol, while the Princess Wild can replace any symbol except the Bonus Princess. There is also a new paytable, often with higher prizes for each symbol. Bonuses can be activated in free games by hitting the Bonus Princess, similar to the bonus in the base game. For four or five Bonus Princess symbols, win the mini bonus. For six or seven, win the minor bonus. The maximum requires eight or nine.\n        ",
