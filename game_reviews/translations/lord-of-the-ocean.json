Da allora la software house austriaca non ha smesso di evolversi e proporre al pubblico un catalogo sempre più ampio con slot sempre più raffinate. Lord Of The Ocean è senza dubbio una di queste!\nCi troviamo nella profondità del mare, avvolti dai flutti e in compagnia delle creature che lo popolano, tra cui ila mitologica divinità Poseidone, che con il tridente stretto in mano ci porta alla scoperta degli antichi tesori sepolti nei fondali.\nLa qualità grafica in questa slot è veramente eccezionale! Sono presenti infatti le animazioni 3D, che rendono il gioco ancora più coinvolgente e accattivante, e fanno sentire il giocatore totalmente immerso nell’esperienza ludica.\n\nLord of the Ocean Simboli, Wild e Scatter\nCome da tradizione in casa Novomatic, ai simboli tematici si affiancano le tradizionali carte da gioco, dal 9 all’Asso.\nTra i simboli legati invece al mondo marino troviamo oltre al mitico dio dei mari Poseidone, degli scrigni colmi d’oro, amuleti preziosi e il Gate, ossia una porta.\nPoseidone, e non poteva essere altrimenti, è il simbolo che paga più di tutti, inoltre, ha anche la funzione di Wild, e può quindi sostituire tutti gli altri simboli per il completamento di una combinazione vincente.\nL’unico simbolo che non può essere sostituito da quello Wild è lo Scatter, in questo caso rappresentato dal Gate, che serve sia ad attivare i giri gratuiti, sia per moltiplicare le vincite.\n\nModalità di gioco Lord of the Ocean\nLa modalità di gioco base di questa slot è quella tradizionale: per vincere bisogna allineare dei simboli uguali a partire da sinistra verso destra. Sono tuttavia presenti alcune funzionalità speciali che permettono di aumentare le possibilità di vincita. Vediamo quali sono:\n\nIl simbolo Scatter: quando compare per tre volte si attiva la funzione “Free spins”, e si ottengono in questo modo ben 10 giri gratis. Inoltre, quando lo Scatter compare per tre volte la puntata sarà pagata due volte, se compare quattro volte si avrà un moltiplicatore di 20, mentre 5 simboli Scatter pagheranno 200 volte la puntata\nFunzione Gamble: dopo ogni vincita di qualsiasi entità si può decidere se tentare la fortuna e provare a raddoppiare il montepremi. Comparirà una carta girata di cui si dovrà indovinare il colore, rosso o nero, e in caso di scommessa giusta la vincita sarà raddoppiata\n\n\nConsiderazioni finali\nQuesta slot è indubbiamente molto bella dal punto di vista estetico e offre una modalità di gioco abbastanza classica. Il range di puntate è ampio, partendo infatti da una puntata minima di 1 centesimo fino alla massima di 30 euro, per questo è adatta sia a chi si affaccia per la prima volta al mondo delle slot, sia a chi invece è un po’ più navigato e ama le scommesse di un certo valore.\nIl payout è del 95,1% e la volatilità è media: ciò significa che pur essendo le vincite abbastanza frequenti, non raggiungeranno mai cifre enormi.\nNel complesso si tratta di un gioco molto ben riuscito, che conferma la Novomatic come azienda di punta nel settore.\n",

Since then, the Austrian software house has continued to evolve and offer an ever-expanding catalog of increasingly sophisticated slots to the public. Lord of the Ocean is undoubtedly one of them!\n\nWe find ourselves in the depths of the ocean, surrounded by waves and in the company of the creatures that populate it, including the mythological deity Poseidon, who with his trident in hand leads us to discover the ancient treasures buried in the depths.\n\nThe graphic quality in this slot is truly exceptional! There are 3D animations, which make the game even more immersive and captivating, and make the player feel totally immersed in the gaming experience.\n\nLord of the Ocean Symbols, Wilds, and Scatters\n\nAs tradition goes with Novomatic, thematic symbols are accompanied by traditional playing cards from 9 to Ace. Among the symbols related to the marine world, we find, in addition to the mythical sea god Poseidon, treasure-filled chests, precious amulets, and the Gate, a door.\n\nPoseidon, and it couldn't be otherwise, is the symbol that pays more than all the others, also, it also has the function of Wild, and can therefore replace all other symbols to complete a winning combination.\n\nThe only symbol that cannot be replaced by the Wild symbol is the Scatter, in this case represented by the Gate, which serves both to activate free spins and to multiply winnings.\n\nGameplay of Lord of the Ocean\n\nThe basic game mode of this slot is traditional: to win, you must align the same symbols from left to right. However, there are some special features that allow you to increase your chances of winning. Let's see what they are:\n\nThe Scatter symbol: when it appears three times, the \"Free spins\" function is activated, and in this way, you get 10 free spins. In addition, when the Scatter appears three times, the bet will be paid twice, if it appears four times, there will be a 20x multiplier, and 5 Scatter symbols will pay 200x the bet.\n\nGamble feature: after any winning combination, you can decide whether to try your luck and try to double the prize pool. A turned-over card will appear, and you have to guess the color, whether red or black, and in case of a correct bet, the winnings will be doubled.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThis slot is undoubtedly very beautiful aesthetically and offers a particularly classic game mode. The range of bets is wide, starting from a minimum bet of 1 cent up to a maximum of 30 euros, making it suitable both for those who are approaching the world of slots for the first time and for those who are more seasoned and love bets of a certain value.\n\nThe payout is 95.1% and the volatility is medium: this means that while the payouts are quite frequent, they will never reach huge amounts. Overall, it is a very successful game that confirms Novomatic as a leading company in the industry.\n            ",

Since then, the Austrian software house has continued to evolve and offer an ever-expanding catalog of increasingly sophisticated slots to the public. Lord of the Ocean is undoubtedly one of them!\n\nWe find ourselves in the depths of the ocean, surrounded by waves and in the company of the creatures that populate it, including the mythological deity Poseidon, who with his trident in hand leads us to discover the ancient treasures buried in the depths.\n\nThe graphic quality in this slot is truly exceptional! There are 3D animations, which make the game even more immersive and captivating, and make the player feel totally immersed in the gaming experience.\n\nLord of the Ocean Symbols, Wilds, and Scatters\n\nAs tradition goes with Novomatic, thematic symbols are accompanied by traditional playing cards from 9 to Ace. Among the symbols related to the marine world, we find, in addition to the mythical sea god Poseidon, treasure-filled chests, precious amulets, and the Gate, a door.\n\nPoseidon, and it couldn't be otherwise, is the symbol that pays more than all the others, also, it also has the function of Wild, and can therefore replace all other symbols to complete a winning combination.\n\nThe only symbol that cannot be replaced by the Wild symbol is the Scatter, in this case represented by the Gate, which serves both to activate free spins and to multiply winnings.\n\nGameplay of Lord of the Ocean\n\nThe basic game mode of this slot is traditional: to win, you must align the same symbols from left to right. However, there are some special features that allow you to increase your chances of winning. Let's see what they are:\n\nThe Scatter symbol: when it appears three times, the \"Free spins\" function is activated, and in this way, you get 10 free spins. In addition, when the Scatter appears three times, the bet will be paid twice, if it appears four times, there will be a 20x multiplier, and 5 Scatter symbols will pay 200x the bet.\n\nGamble feature: after any winning combination, you can decide whether to try your luck and try to double the prize pool. A turned-over card will appear, and you have to guess the color, whether red or black, and in case of a correct bet, the winnings will be doubled.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThis slot is undoubtedly very beautiful aesthetically and offers a particularly classic game mode. The range of bets is wide, starting from a minimum bet of 1 cent up to a maximum of 30 euros, making it suitable both for those who are approaching the world of slots for the first time and for those who are more seasoned and love bets of a certain value.\n\nThe payout is 95.1% and the volatility is medium: this means that while the payouts are quite frequent, they will never reach huge amounts. Overall, it is a very successful game that confirms Novomatic as a leading company in the industry.\n            ",

Among the symbols related to the marine world, we find, in addition to the mythical sea god Poseidon, treasure-filled chests, precious amulets, and the Gate, a door.\n\nPoseidon, and it couldn't be otherwise, is the symbol that pays more than all the others, also, it also has the function of Wild, and can therefore replace all other symbols to complete a winning combination.\n\nThe only symbol that cannot be replaced by the Wild symbol is the Scatter, in this case represented by the Gate, which serves both to activate free spins and to multiply winnings.\n\nGameplay of Lord of the Ocean\n\nThe basic game mode of this slot is traditional: to win, you must align the same symbols from left to right. However, there are some special features that allow you to increase your chances of winning. Let's see what they are:\n\nThe Scatter symbol: when it appears three times, the \"Free spins\" function is activated, and in this way, you get 10 free spins. In addition, when the Scatter appears three times, the bet will be paid twice, if it appears four times, there will be a 20x multiplier, and 5 Scatter symbols will pay 200x the bet.\n\nGamble feature: after any winning combination, you can decide whether to try your luck and try to double the prize pool. A turned-over card will appear, and you have to guess the color, whether red or black, and in case of a correct bet, the winnings will be doubled.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThis slot is undoubtedly very beautiful aesthetically and offers a particularly classic game mode. The range of bets is wide, starting from a minimum bet of 1 cent up to a maximum of 30 euros, making it suitable both for those who are approaching the world of slots for the first time and for those who are more seasoned and love bets of a certain value.\n\nThe payout is 95.1% and the volatility is medium: this means that while the payouts are quite frequent, they will never reach huge amounts. Overall, it is a very successful game that confirms Novomatic as a leading company in the industry.\n            ",
