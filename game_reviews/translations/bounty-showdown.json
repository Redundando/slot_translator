This game offers an eerie twist to the typical Wild West theme, as you navigate your way through 5 reels and 10 active paylines in search of big wins of up to 4,500x your bet.\n\nThe action heats up as soon as you land three or more scatter symbols, which will trigger the Showdown Free Spins. However, before the free spins begin, you must first accumulate a special multiplier through the Gatling Wheel Bonus, where the values range from 2x to 100x.\n\nNow, it's time to tie up your horses and enter the saloon to see what this video slot has to offer. Make sure to try it out for yourself in the free demo game included in our article. It is easily accessible and playable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.\n\nGraphics Straight Out of the Wild West\n\nEnter into a Wild West shootout with a band of sharpshooting bandits in the Bounty Showdown slot game by Fantasma Games. This 5-reel, 10-payline slot offers players a couple of features to make the game more enjoyable. Landing two Bonus Wild Symbols will trigger the Double Bonus Respins feature, where two reels stay in place while the remaining three spin again. The Showdown Free Spins feature starts with up to 20 free spins. Each time a Bonus Wild Symbol lands, it awards a win multiplier atop any standard combo win. Wins in this game can reach up to 4,761x your initial wager. \n\nBounty Showdown has a Wild West theme, focusing on a trio of vigilantes seeking revenge against the mysterious gunslinger, Mr. Joe Boneson, who brought their bandit friend to justice. The setting is that of a classic Wild West town, complete with wooden shacks and a noisy saloon. Accompanying the comic-style imagery is a strident soundtrack that really rocks during the free spins feature. The game's design perfectly fits the bandit theme.\n\nOn the reels, you'll find Ace to Jack and four symbols of the bandits that pay the most. The best of the quartet is the bandit with the skull face. Land 3, 4, or 5 of this character on a payline and you'll earn a prize of 10x, 25x, or 100x your total bet.\n\nThe golden coin with the skull design is the Bonus Wild. As usual, it substitutes all standard symbols. Land 3, 4, or 5 in combination, and you'll earn a win equal to 10x, 25x, or 100x your bet, as well as triggering the free spins feature.\n\nBounty Showdown is available to play on all devices, including mobiles, tablets, and desktop and laptop computers. It's a simple game to play, and you won't miss anything by playing the mobile version of Bounty Showdown compared to the larger screen versions.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nAlthough Bounty Showdown by Fantasma Games doesn't entirely fit the Wild West genre, it is certainly not your typical Western-themed video slot. Upon loading the game, players enter into an ill-lit, and very uninviting western town. There's an element of heavy rock in the theme tune that accompanies the game, and we must say that it fits the slot style really well.\n\nTurning to the payout table in Bounty Showdown, the traditional Royals J, Q, K, and Ace represent the lower values. The highest-paying symbols in the game are the four main characters, including the bounty hunter, cowboy, bounty hunter (who resembles Michael Jackson), and the skeleton cowboy, where a win of 5 of a kind pays respectively 30x, 40x, 50x, and 100x your initial bet. The Golden Skull symbol is both the wild and scatter symbol in the game and will substitute for all game symbols.\n\nActivating the Double Bonus Respin feature involves landing two Bonus Wild symbols anywhere on the reels in a single spin. Any line win is paid out and the two reels containing the Bonus Wilds remain in place. The other reels spin again, providing another chance to land a winning combo or another Bonus Wild Symbol to trigger the Showdown Free Spins.\n\nThe Showdown Free Spins are triggered by landing 3, 4, or 5 wild scatter symbols in view, which respectively award 10, 15, and 20 free spins. However, before the spins start, you are taken to the Gatling Wheel Bonus Game, where you receive 3 shots to accumulate a win multiplier value for the scatter symbol in the free spins feature. These multiplier values go up to 100x, so there's plenty to play for here.\n\nEach time a Bonus Wild Symbol lands during the free spins, the combined value of the 3 numbers is applied to your total bet and awarded as an instant win prize. These add to any standard line win payouts. For instance, let's say the Gatling Wheel spin stops on values of 2, 3, and 5. This gives a total of 10x. Each time a Bonus Wild lands during the free spins, a prize of 10x your total bet is awarded.",

Il simbolo Golden Skull è sia il simbolo wild che il simbolo scatter all’interno del gioco, e sostituirà tutti gli altri simboli del gioco.\nAttiva la funzione Double Bonus Respin atterrando 2 simboli Bonus Wild ovunque sui rulli nello stesso giro. Qualsiasi vincita di linea viene pagata per prima. I 2 rulli che contengono i simboli Bonus Wild vengono poi trattenuti.\nIl resto dei rulli gira di nuovo per offrire un’altra possibilità di ottenere una combinazione vincente o un altro simbolo Bonus Wild che attiva la funzione Showdown Free Spins.\nI giri gratuiti Showdown si attivano su Bounty Showdown quando 3, 4, o 5 simboli scatter wild atterrano in vista, e questi assegnano rispettivamente 10, 15, e 20 giri gratuiti. Tuttavia, prima che i giri inizino, vieni portato al Gatling Wheel Bonus Game, dove ti vengono assegnati 3 colpi per accumulare un valore moltiplicatore per il simbolo scatter nella funzione giri gratis. Questi valori moltiplicatori arrivano fino a 100x, quindi c’è molto da giocare qui.\nOgni volta che un simbolo Bonus Wild atterra durante i giri gratis, il valore combinato dei 3 numeri viene applicato alla tua puntata totale e assegnato come premio di vittoria istantanea. Questi si aggiungono a qualsiasi vincita standard delle linee di pagamento. Per esempio, diciamo che la rotazione della Ruota di Gatling si è fermata su valori di 2, 3 e 5. Questo dà un totale di 10x. Ogni volta che un Bonus Wild atterra durante i giri gratis, viene fatto un premio pari a 10x la tua puntata totale.\n\n        ",

Saddle up and pave your way to big wins where 5 reels and 10 active paylines can earn you up to 4,500x your bet.\n\nThe action heats up when you get 3 or more scatter symbols to activate the Showdown Free Spins. But before that, you'll have to accumulate a special multiplier through the Gatling Wheel Bonus, where values range from 2x to 100x.\n\nIt's time to tie up the horses and enter the saloon to see what this video slot has to offer in our full game review. Make sure to try it out for yourself in the included free demo game available on desktop, tablet, and mobile.\n\nThe Bounty Showdown slot game features a Wild West theme with a backstory centered around a trio of vigilantes seeking revenge against the mysterious gunfighter, Mr. Joe Boneson, who brought their bandit friend to justice.\n\nThe setting is a classic Wild West town made up of wooden shacks and a noisy saloon. Adding to the comic book-style visuals is a loud soundtrack that really rocks during the free spins feature. The design here is very fitting for the bandit theme.\n\nOn the reels, you'll find the standard A to J royals and 4 bandit symbols that pay out the most. The best of the quartet is the skull-faced bandit. Land 3, 4, or 5 of this character on a payline and you'll earn a prize of 10, 25 or 100x your total bet.\n\nThe golden coin with the skull motif is the Bonus Wild. As usual, it replaces all standard symbols. Land 3, 4 or 5 in combination and you'll earn a win equal to 10, 25 or 100x your bet, as well as trigger the free spins feature.\n\nBounty Showdown is available to play on all devices, including mobile phones, tablets, desktops, and laptops. It's a very easy game to play, and you won't miss anything playing the mobile Bounty Showdown slot compared to a larger screen version.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe Bounty Showdown slot game by Fantasma Games may not fit perfectly into the Wild West genre, but it's certainly not your typical Western-themed video slot. When the game loads, we find ourselves entering a poorly lit and very uninviting western town. There's an element of heavy rock in the theme melody that accompanies the game, and I must say that it fits the slot style very well.\n\nLooking at the paytable in Bounty Showdown, it's the traditional royals J, Q, K, and Ace that represent the lower values. The highest-paying symbols in the game are the 4 main characters, the bounty hunter, the cowboy, the bounty hunter (who resembles Michael Jackson), and the skeleton cowboy. A 5-of-a-kind win will pay out respectively 30x, 40x, 50x, and 100x your initial bet. The Golden Skull symbol is both the wild and scatter symbol within the game, and will substitute for every other symbol in the game.\n\nActivate the Double Bonus Respin feature by landing 2 Bonus Wild symbols anywhere on the reels on the same spin. Any payline win is paid out first. The 2 reels containing the Bonus Wild symbols are then held in place.\n\nThe remaining reels spin again to offer another chance to get a winning combination or another Bonus Wild symbol that triggers the Showdown Free Spins feature.\n\nThe Showdown Free Spins are activated on Bounty Showdown when 3, 4, or 5 wild scatter symbols land in view, and these award 10, 15, and 20 free spins respectively. However, before the spins start, you'll be taken to the Gatling Wheel Bonus Game, where you're given 3 shots to accumulate a multiplier value for the scatter symbol in the free spins feature. These multiplier values can go up to 100x, so there's a lot to play for here.\n\nEvery time a Bonus Wild symbol lands during free spins, the combined value of the 3 numbers is applied to your total bet and awarded as an instant win prize. These are added to any standard payline wins. For example, let's say the Gatling Wheel spin landed on values of 2, 3 and 5. This gives a total of 10x. Every time a Bonus Wild lands during free spins, a prize of 10x your total bet is awarded."

This 5-reel, 10-payline slot offers players a couple of features to make the game more enjoyable. Landing two Bonus Wild Symbols will trigger the Double Bonus Respins feature, where two reels stay in place while the remaining three spin again. The Showdown Free Spins feature starts with up to 20 free spins. Each time a Bonus Wild Symbol lands, it awards a win multiplier atop any standard combo win. Wins in this game can reach up to 4,761x your initial wager. \n\nBounty Showdown has a Wild West theme, focusing on a trio of vigilantes seeking revenge against the mysterious gunslinger, Mr. Joe Boneson, who brought their bandit friend to justice.

It's a simple game to play, and you won't miss anything by playing the mobile version of Bounty Showdown compared to the larger screen versions.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nAlthough Bounty Showdown by Fantasma Games doesn't entirely fit the Wild West genre, it is certainly not your typical Western-themed video slot. Upon loading the game, players enter into an ill-lit, and very uninviting western town. There's an element of heavy rock in the theme tune that accompanies the game, and we must say that it fits the slot style really well.\n\nTurning to the payout table in Bounty Showdown, the traditional Royals J, Q, K, and Ace represent the lower values. The highest-paying symbols in the game are the four main characters, including the bounty hunter, cowboy, bounty hunter (who resembles Michael Jackson), and the skeleton cowboy, where a win of 5 of a kind pays respectively 30x, 40x, 50x, and 100x your initial bet. The Golden Skull symbol is both the wild and scatter symbol in the game and will substitute for all game symbols.\n\nActivating the Double Bonus Respin feature involves landing two Bonus Wild symbols anywhere on the reels in a single spin. Any line win is paid out and the two reels containing the Bonus Wilds remain in place. The other reels spin again, providing another chance to land a winning combo or another Bonus Wild Symbol to trigger the Showdown Free Spins.\n\nThe Showdown Free Spins are triggered by landing 3, 4, or 5 wild scatter symbols in view, which respectively award 10, 15, and 20 free spins. However, before the spins start, you are taken to the Gatling Wheel Bonus Game, where you receive 3 shots to accumulate a win multiplier value for the scatter symbol in the free spins feature. These multiplier values go up to 100x, so there's plenty to play for here.\n\nEach time a Bonus Wild Symbol lands during the free spins, the combined value of the 3 numbers is applied to your total bet and awarded as an instant win prize. These add to any standard line win payouts. For instance, let's say the Gatling Wheel spin stops on values of 2, 3, and 5. This gives a total of 10x. Each time a Bonus Wild lands during the free spins, a prize of 10x your total bet is awarded.\n        ",

This game offers an eerie twist to the typical Wild West theme, as you navigate your way through 5 reels and 10 active paylines in search of big wins of up to 4,500x your bet.\n\nThe action heats up as soon as you land three or more scatter symbols, which will trigger the Showdown Free Spins.

Make sure to try it out for yourself in the free demo game included in our article. It is easily accessible and playable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.\n\nGraphics Straight Out of the Wild West\n\nEnter into a Wild West shootout with a band of sharpshooting bandits in the Bounty Showdown slot game by Fantasma Games. This 5-reel, 10-payline slot offers players a couple of features to make the game more enjoyable. Landing two Bonus Wild Symbols will trigger the Double Bonus Respins feature, where two reels stay in place while the remaining three spin again. The Showdown Free Spins feature starts with up to 20 free spins. Each time a Bonus Wild Symbol lands, it awards a win multiplier atop any standard combo win. Wins in this game can reach up to 4,761x your initial wager. \n\nBounty Showdown has a Wild West theme, focusing on a trio of vigilantes seeking revenge against the mysterious gunslinger, Mr. Joe Boneson, who brought their bandit friend to justice. The setting is that of a classic Wild West town, complete with wooden shacks and a noisy saloon. Accompanying the comic-style imagery is a strident soundtrack that really rocks during the free spins feature. The game's design perfectly fits the bandit theme.\n\nOn the reels, you'll find Ace to Jack and four symbols of the bandits that pay the most. The best of the quartet is the bandit with the skull face. Land 3, 4, or 5 of this character on a payline and you'll earn a prize of 10x, 25x, or 100x your total bet.\n\nThe golden coin with the skull design is the Bonus Wild. As usual, it substitutes all standard symbols. Land 3, 4, or 5 in combination, and you'll earn a win equal to 10x, 25x, or 100x your bet, as well as triggering the free spins feature.\n\nBounty Showdown is available to play on all devices, including mobiles, tablets, and desktop and laptop computers. It's a simple game to play, and you won't miss anything by playing the mobile version of Bounty Showdown compared to the larger screen versions.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nAlthough Bounty Showdown by Fantasma Games doesn't entirely fit the Wild West genre, it is certainly not your typical Western-themed video slot. Upon loading the game, players enter into an ill-lit, and very uninviting western town. There's an element of heavy rock in the theme tune that accompanies the game, and we must say that it fits the slot style really well.\n\nTurning to the payout table in Bounty Showdown, the traditional Royals J, Q, K, and Ace represent the lower values. The highest-paying symbols in the game are the four main characters, including the bounty hunter, cowboy, bounty hunter (who resembles Michael Jackson), and the skeleton cowboy, where a win of 5 of a kind pays respectively 30x, 40x, 50x, and 100x your initial bet. The Golden Skull symbol is both the wild and scatter symbol in the game and will substitute for all game symbols.\n\nActivating the Double Bonus Respin feature involves landing two Bonus Wild symbols anywhere on the reels in a single spin. Any line win is paid out and the two reels containing the Bonus Wilds remain in place. The other reels spin again, providing another chance to land a winning combo or another Bonus Wild Symbol to trigger the Showdown Free Spins.\n\nThe Showdown Free Spins are triggered by landing 3, 4, or 5 wild scatter symbols in view, which respectively award 10, 15, and 20 free spins. However, before the spins start, you are taken to the Gatling Wheel Bonus Game, where you receive 3 shots to accumulate a win multiplier value for the scatter symbol in the free spins feature. These multiplier values go up to 100x, so there's plenty to play for here.\n\nEach time a Bonus Wild Symbol lands during the free spins, the combined value of the 3 numbers is applied to your total bet and awarded as an instant win prize. These add to any standard line win payouts. For instance, let's say the Gatling Wheel spin stops on values of 2, 3, and 5. This gives a total of 10x. Each time a Bonus Wild lands during the free spins, a prize of 10x your total bet is awarded.\n            ",

It features a duo of bonus features, Double Bonus Respins and Showdown Free Spins, which land when two Bonus Wilds or three or more wild scatters appear in either order. The game has the potential to offer big wins up to 4,500x your bet.\n\nFantasma Games\n\nFantasma Games is a company that specializes in the development of online video slot games for various platforms. They focus on creating exciting games that combine innovative features and compelling themes that ignite players' imagination and offer an engaging gaming experience.\n\nWild West Theme\n\nBounty Showdown takes players on a journey to a classic Wild West town complete with wooden shacks and a noisy saloon. The slot features four symbols of bandits that pay the most, the best of which being the character with a skull face. Players can expect an uninviting atmosphere and heavy rock music that perfectly fits the bandit theme.\n\nDouble Bonus Respins Feature\n\nLanding two Bonus Wild symbols in a single spin triggers the Double Bonus Respins feature. This feature locks two reels, while the remaining three spin again, increasing the chance of landing matching symbols. Payouts are then calculated as per the active paylines, and the player moves to the next spin. Activating this feature also fills the player's meter, which triggers the Showdown Free Spins feature.\n\nShowdown Free Spins Feature\n\nThis feature is triggered when three or more Golden Skull symbols appear on the reels. Before free spins begin, players enter the Gatling Wheel Bonus round, where they can accumulate a win multiplier for the wild scatter symbol ranging from 2x to 100x. The number of free spins awarded is equal to the number of Golden Skull symbols that triggered the feature, with a maximum of 20 free spins. Players can earn bonus wins during this feature each time a Bonus Wild symbol lands.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nBounty Showdown has a visually appealing design that perfectly fits the Wild West theme. The game's images are comic-style, with a dark touch to create an eerie atmosphere. The soundtrack features heavy rock tones that accompany the game style really well, and the sound effects are high quality, adding to the overall immersive gaming experience.\n\nAccessibility on Desktop and Mobile Devices\n\nBounty Showdown offers an engaging gameplay experience on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile. The game's design is simple yet effective, and mobile players won't miss anything compared to playing on larger screens.\n\n        \n            ",

However, before the free spins begin, you must first accumulate a special multiplier through the Gatling Wheel Bonus, where the values range from 2x to 100x.\n\nNow, it's time to tie up your horses and enter the saloon to see what this video slot has to offer. Make sure to try it out for yourself in the free demo game included in our article. It is easily accessible and playable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.\n\nGraphics Straight Out of the Wild West\n\nEnter into a Wild West shootout with a band of sharpshooting bandits in the Bounty Showdown slot game by Fantasma Games. This 5-reel, 10-payline slot offers players a couple of features to make the game more enjoyable. Landing two Bonus Wild Symbols will trigger the Double Bonus Respins feature, where two reels stay in place while the remaining three spin again. The Showdown Free Spins feature starts with up to 20 free spins. Each time a Bonus Wild Symbol lands, it awards a win multiplier atop any standard combo win. Wins in this game can reach up to 4,761x your initial wager. \n\nBounty Showdown has a Wild West theme, focusing on a trio of vigilantes seeking revenge against the mysterious gunslinger, Mr. Joe Boneson, who brought their bandit friend to justice. The setting is that of a classic Wild West town, complete with wooden shacks and a noisy saloon. Accompanying the comic-style imagery is a strident soundtrack that really rocks during the free spins feature. The game's design perfectly fits the bandit theme.\n\nOn the reels, you'll find Ace to Jack and four symbols of the bandits that pay the most. The best of the quartet is the bandit with the skull face. Land 3, 4, or 5 of this character on a payline and you'll earn a prize of 10x, 25x, or 100x your total bet.\n\nThe golden coin with the skull design is the Bonus Wild. As usual, it substitutes all standard symbols. Land 3, 4, or 5 in combination, and you'll earn a win equal to 10x, 25x, or 100x your bet, as well as triggering the free spins feature.\n\nBounty Showdown is available to play on all devices, including mobiles, tablets, and desktop and laptop computers. It's a simple game to play, and you won't miss anything by playing the mobile version of Bounty Showdown compared to the larger screen versions.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nAlthough Bounty Showdown by Fantasma Games doesn't entirely fit the Wild West genre, it is certainly not your typical Western-themed video slot. Upon loading the game, players enter into an ill-lit, and very uninviting western town. There's an element of heavy rock in the theme tune that accompanies the game, and we must say that it fits the slot style really well.\n\nTurning to the payout table in Bounty Showdown, the traditional Royals J, Q, K, and Ace represent the lower values. The highest-paying symbols in the game are the four main characters, including the bounty hunter, cowboy, bounty hunter (who resembles Michael Jackson), and the skeleton cowboy, where a win of 5 of a kind pays respectively 30x, 40x, 50x, and 100x your initial bet. The Golden Skull symbol is both the wild and scatter symbol in the game and will substitute for all game symbols.\n\nActivating the Double Bonus Respin feature involves landing two Bonus Wild symbols anywhere on the reels in a single spin. Any line win is paid out and the two reels containing the Bonus Wilds remain in place. The other reels spin again, providing another chance to land a winning combo or another Bonus Wild Symbol to trigger the Showdown Free Spins.\n\nThe Showdown Free Spins are triggered by landing 3, 4, or 5 wild scatter symbols in view, which respectively award 10, 15, and 20 free spins. However, before the spins start, you are taken to the Gatling Wheel Bonus Game, where you receive 3 shots to accumulate a win multiplier value for the scatter symbol in the free spins feature. These multiplier values go up to 100x, so there's plenty to play for here.\n\nEach time a Bonus Wild Symbol lands during the free spins, the combined value of the 3 numbers is applied to your total bet and awarded as an instant win prize. These add to any standard line win payouts. For instance, let's say the Gatling Wheel spin stops on values of 2, 3, and 5. This gives a total of 10x. Each time a Bonus Wild lands during the free spins, a prize of 10x your total bet is awarded.\n            ",

The cartoon-style image should feature a happy Maya warrior wearing glasses. The warrior could be sitting on top of a horse, holding a lasso, or standing in front of a wooden saloon. The background of the image should showcase the Wild West landscape, including red rock formations, a Western town, or a dusty desert. The text \"Bounty Showdown\" should be prominently displayed in an Old West-style font. The overall feel of the image should be fun and vibrant, with bright colors and playful details."
