Ci troviamo sulla riva dell’Oceano in una bellissima giornata di sole a sorseggiare cocktail in compagnia di Bananza, una scimmia vacanziera vestita con camicia viola shock e occhiali di sole. Al centro dello schermo trova posto la griglia di gioco, incorniciata nelle canne di bambù e con qualche motivo floreale agli angoli.

In this one, we find ourselves on the seashore of the ocean on a beautiful sunny day sipping cocktails with Bananza, a vacationing monkey dressed in a shocking purple shirt and sunglasses. In the center of the screen is the game grid, framed in bamboo with some floral motifs in the corners. The buttons are located at the bottom, while the various multipliers we'll see up close in the next paragraphs appear at the top.\n\nThe symbols are well-drawn, though the definition is not as high as in other 3D slots. Nevertheless, the provider's work is more than satisfactory.\n\nGameplay features\nThe grid has standard dimensions, with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 50 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is low, starting at just €0.20, yet the potential highest payout is 3,400 times the bet. To win, you must create winning combos by matching identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. It's possible to obtain two wins on the same line, in which case only the highest sum will be paid. If the series of symbols occurs on different lines, then the amounts will be added up and paid.\n\nClicking on the lightning bolt button accelerates the dropping of symbols, while the Autoplay function lets you automatically spin the reels without having to press Play each time. The variance is moderate, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is at intervals starting from 95.8%.\n\nSymbols and gameplay\nThe game mechanism is cascade-based, so after every winning combo the symbols are removed and replaced, creating new opportunities for victory. Moreover, each cascade is associated with a multiplier: it starts at 2x and can increase to a maximum of 5x. When no more paying combos are obtained, the multiplier resets. Each cascade is then counted in a special counter that, once completed, awards Golden Spins, special spins characterized by multipliers that can go up to 10x.\n\nThe regular symbols are fruits, with plums and lemons paying up to 5 times the bet, cherries and pineapples up to 20, and coconuts and watermelons up to 100. The Wild is the gold monkey and replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The golden banana, on the other hand, is the Scatter and three of them are needed to trigger 10 Free Spins. During the bonus game, the multiplier starts at 3x and goes on to 6x, 9x, and finally, 15x.\n\nFAQ\nHow many Free Spins can I win? In this slot, you can win 10 Free Spins with the arrival of 3 Scatters.\n\nCan I play on my mobile phone? Yes, Bananza works on any mobile device and with any operating system, IOS, Android, etc.\n\nIs there a jackpot system in Bananza? No, this slot does not offer any jackpot.",

As if the cascade-based game mechanism wasn't enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, Bananza also has something called a Golden Spin. This spin is awarded when the cascade multiplier reaches a maximum of five times, which, trust us, is no easy feat. The Golden Spin, as the name suggests, is special, and its multipliers can go up to 10x. Yes, you read that right! 10x. Talk about a chance to hit it big!</p><p>As if all that wasn't enough, the game's scatter symbol, the golden banana, is the key to unlocking even more winning potential.

It boasts a game mechanism that is cascade-based, providing players with an endless array of winning opportunities. Every time you hit a winning combo, the symbols involved in that combo disappear, making way for new ones to fill the void, potentially triggering new wins with every passing second. And that's not even the best part! Each cascade is associated with a multiplier that increases up to five times, offering players the chance to win big bucks in no time.</p><p>But wait, there's more! As if the cascade-based game mechanism wasn't enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, Bananza also has something called a Golden Spin. This spin is awarded when the cascade multiplier reaches a maximum of five times, which, trust us, is no easy feat. The Golden Spin, as the name suggests, is special, and its multipliers can go up to 10x. Yes, you read that right! 10x. Talk about a chance to hit it big!</p><p>As if all that wasn't enough, the game's scatter symbol, the golden banana, is the key to unlocking even more winning potential. Collect three golden bananas, and you trigger 10 free spins. But wait, it gets better. During these free spins, the multiplier increases up to a whopping 15x! Now that, my friends, is bananas!</p>\"\n}"

The game grid is framed in bamboo with some floral motifs in the corners, making the overall gameplay setting attractive. While the game's graphics are well-drawn, the definition is not as high as in other 3D slots, making the experience fall just short of perfection.\n\nGameplay mechanics\n\nBananza maintains a standard 5-reel, 3-row slot, with 50 fixed paylines, and a minimum bet of €0.20. The potential highest payout is 3,400 times the bet. To win, players must match identical symbols starting from the left reel. It's possible to obtain two wins on the same line, in which case only the highest sum will be paid. The lightning bolt button accelerates the dropping of symbols, while the autoplay function lets players spin the reels automatically. The variance is moderate, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is at intervals starting from 95.8%.\n\nSymbols and graphics\n\nThe symbols are well-drawn with various fruits such as plums, lemons, cherries, pineapples, coconuts, and watermelons, as well as the monkey symbol. The wild is the gold monkey and replaces all the standard symbols except the scatter. The golden banana is the scatter symbol, which when three are collected, trigger 10 free spins. During the bonus game, the multiplier can increase up to 15x.\n\nPaylines and variance\n\nBananza offers 50 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is €0.20, and players have the possibility of winning up to 3,400 times their bet. The variance in the game is moderate, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) ranges from 95.8%.\n\nSpecial features\n\nBananza's game mechanism is cascade-based, providing new opportunities for victory after every winning combo. Each cascade is associated with a multiplier that can increase up to five times, after which a Golden Spin is awarded. Golden Spins are special spins characterized by multipliers that can go up to 10x. The slot's scatter symbol is the golden banana, and when three are collected, 10 free spins are triggered, during which its multiplier increases up to 15x.\n\nAccessibility and RTP\n\nBananza works on any mobile device and with any operating system, IOS, Android, etc. The slot's theoretical return to player (RTP) ranges from 95.8%.\n\n        \n            ",

In this one, we find ourselves on the seashore of the ocean on a beautiful sunny day sipping cocktails with Bananza, a vacationing monkey dressed in a shocking purple shirt and sunglasses. In the center of the screen is the game grid, framed in bamboo with some floral motifs in the corners. The buttons are located at the bottom, while the various multipliers we'll see up close in the next paragraphs appear at the top.\n\nThe symbols are well-drawn, though the definition is not as high as in other 3D slots. Nevertheless, the provider's work is more than satisfactory.\n\nGameplay features\nThe grid has standard dimensions, with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 50 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is low, starting at just €0.20, yet the potential highest payout is 3,400 times the bet. To win, you must create winning combos by matching identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. It's possible to obtain two wins on the same line, in which case only the highest sum will be paid. If the series of symbols occurs on different lines, then the amounts will be added up and paid.\n\nClicking on the lightning bolt button accelerates the dropping of symbols, while the Autoplay function lets you automatically spin the reels without having to press Play each time. The variance is moderate, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is at intervals starting from 95.8%.\n\nSymbols and gameplay\nThe game mechanism is cascade-based, so after every winning combo the symbols are removed and replaced, creating new opportunities for victory. Moreover, each cascade is associated with a multiplier: it starts at 2x and can increase to a maximum of 5x. When no more paying combos are obtained, the multiplier resets. Each cascade is then counted in a special counter that, once completed, awards Golden Spins, special spins characterized by multipliers that can go up to 10x.\n\nThe regular symbols are fruits, with plums and lemons paying up to 5 times the bet, cherries and pineapples up to 20, and coconuts and watermelons up to 100. The Wild is the gold monkey and replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The golden banana, on the other hand, is the Scatter and three of them are needed to trigger 10 Free Spins. During the bonus game, the multiplier starts at 3x and goes on to 6x, 9x, and finally, 15x.\n\nFAQ\nHow many Free Spins can I win? In this slot, you can win 10 Free Spins with the arrival of 3 Scatters.\n\nCan I play on my mobile phone? Yes, Bananza works on any mobile device and with any operating system, IOS, Android, etc.\n\nIs there a jackpot system in Bananza? No, this slot does not offer any jackpot.\n            ",

In this one, we find ourselves on the seashore of the ocean on a beautiful sunny day sipping cocktails with Bananza, a vacationing monkey dressed in a shocking purple shirt and sunglasses. In the center of the screen is the game grid, framed in bamboo with some floral motifs in the corners. The buttons are located at the bottom, while the various multipliers we'll see up close in the next paragraphs appear at the top.\n\nThe symbols are well-drawn, though the definition is not as high as in other 3D slots. Nevertheless, the provider's work is more than satisfactory.\n\nGameplay features\nThe grid has standard dimensions, with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 50 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is low, starting at just €0.20, yet the potential highest payout is 3,400 times the bet. To win, you must create winning combos by matching identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. It's possible to obtain two wins on the same line, in which case only the highest sum will be paid. If the series of symbols occurs on different lines, then the amounts will be added up and paid.\n\nClicking on the lightning bolt button accelerates the dropping of symbols, while the Autoplay function lets you automatically spin the reels without having to press Play each time. The variance is moderate, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is at intervals starting from 95.8%.\n\nSymbols and gameplay\nThe game mechanism is cascade-based, so after every winning combo the symbols are removed and replaced, creating new opportunities for victory. Moreover, each cascade is associated with a multiplier: it starts at 2x and can increase to a maximum of 5x. When no more paying combos are obtained, the multiplier resets. Each cascade is then counted in a special counter that, once completed, awards Golden Spins, special spins characterized by multipliers that can go up to 10x.\n\nThe regular symbols are fruits, with plums and lemons paying up to 5 times the bet, cherries and pineapples up to 20, and coconuts and watermelons up to 100. The Wild is the gold monkey and replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The golden banana, on the other hand, is the Scatter and three of them are needed to trigger 10 Free Spins. During the bonus game, the multiplier starts at 3x and goes on to 6x, 9x, and finally, 15x.\n\nFAQ\nHow many Free Spins can I win? In this slot, you can win 10 Free Spins with the arrival of 3 Scatters.\n\nCan I play on my mobile phone? Yes, Bananza works on any mobile device and with any operating system, IOS, Android, etc.\n\nIs there a jackpot system in Bananza? No, this slot does not offer any jackpot.\n            ",
