Defenders of the Realm fonde la tradizione norrena con quella epica. La storia è semplice: 4 guerrieri sono impegnati a difendere la città contro le forze del male utilizzando i loro poteri ma anche armi speciali, come il famoso martello di Thor o la spada di Excalibur. La griglia di gioco è rappresentata dalla facciata di un altare, con le effigi dei protagonisti poste sulla parte superiore e sullo sfondo una città dalle linee futuristiche ma con richiami tipici dell’architettura araba. Il comparto sonoro è composto da una musica incalzante ma non invadente, che si accompagna a qualche animazione grafica collegata alle vincite. I tasti Play e Autoplay si trovano sulla sinistra, in basso si può impostare il livello della scommessa e attraverso il tasto «+» si accede al menù.\nCaratteristiche di Defenders of the Realm\nLa griglia è una semplice 5×4, con 20 linee di pagamento fisse. La puntata minima è fissata a 0,20 €, la massima a 200 €. Si può decidere di impostare un numero variabile di giri automatici e nel caso scegliere alcuni limiti di giocata. La volatilità è alta, si vince meno di frequente ma sempre ottime somme. RTP nella norma pari al 96%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nI simboli regolari sono 9. Le carte 5, J, Q, K e A scolpite in monili di roccia hanno un basso valore. I simboli più remunerativi sono i 4 guerrieri, con quelli norreni con una quota più alta rispetto a quelli epici.\nLa scritta Wild davanti a una porta semichiusa è il nostro Jolly, è pagante e sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto quelli speciali.\nLo Scatter è invece lo scrigno, se ne compaiono 3 o più, allora si attiverà il Pick Bonus, un gioco speciale multilivello. In pratica ci troveremo davanti a diverse file contenenti dei simboli coperti. Noi dovremo cliccarci sopra e scoprire la tipologia di ricompensa:\n\nIl blu corrisponde a una vincita variabile\nIl verde corrisponde a una vincita e ci fa avanzare di livello\n\nQuando arriviamo all’ultimo livello potremmo trovare la X e allora il gioco si concluderà immediatamente, oppure svelare il simbolo 2x e allora vedremo raddoppiare tutte le vincite.\nLe sorprese però non finiscono qui, perché in Defenders of the Realm c’è anche una funzione chiamata Beat Boxes. In pratica, ogni volta che in una posizione compare il corno, allora questa verrà incorniciata con un colore che rimarrà anche nei giri successivi. In caso di una combinazione vincente, la somma verrà raddoppiata e la cornice sparirà.\nSe le cornici appariranno allineate su tutti i rulli, allora si avrà la funzione Locked Wilds: 10 giri gratuiti durante i quali apparirà un Wild esteso, a volte anche con un moltiplicatore 2x.\n",

Defenders of the Realm seamlessly merges Nordic traditions with the epic. The story revolves around four warriors who use their special powers and weapons, such as Thor's hammer and Excalibur, to defend the city against the forces of evil. The game board is represented by an altar façade, with the protagonists' effigies placed on top and a city in the background with futuristic lines but also typical references to Arabic architecture. The sound effects are accompanied by an intense and invigorating music, which is not intrusive but complements some of the graphical animations. The play and autoplay buttons are located on the left, while the betting level can be set on the bottom and the menu can be accessed through the \"+\" sign.\n\nFeatures of Defenders of the Realm\n\nThe board is a simple 5x4 with 20 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is €0.20 and the maximum is €200. One can decide to set a variable number of automatic spins and choose some playing limits. The volatility is high, with less frequent but still great wins. The RTP is within the norm, equal to 96%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nThere are nine regular symbols. The cards, 5, J, Q, K, and A, carved in rock jewels, have low values. The most rewarding symbols are the four warriors, with the Nordic ones having higher rewards than the epic ones.\n\nThe word Wild in front of a half-closed door is our wild card, which pays and replaces all other symbols except the special ones.\n\nThe scatter, on the other hand, is a chest. If three or more appear, the Pick Bonus will be activated, a special multilevel game. Essentially, we will be faced with different rows containing covered symbols.

Players can set a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum bet of €200. The game has a high volatility with less frequent but great wins. The RTP is 96%, which is within the norm. Players can decide to set a variable number of automatic spins and choose some playing limits. The game features a Beat Boxes function where each time a horn appears, it will be framed with a color that will remain in subsequent spins. If a winning combination occurs, the payout will be doubled, and the frame will disappear.\n\nVisual Design\n\nDefenders of the Realm is set in a fantasy world and merges Nordic traditions with the epic. The game board is represented by an altar façade, with the protagonists' effigies placed on top and a city in the background with futuristic lines but also typical references to Arabic architecture. The sound effects are accompanied by an intense and invigorating music, which is not intrusive but complements some of the graphical animations. The graphics and animations of the game are visually stunning and engaging.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nDefenders of the Realm has a high volatility, with less frequent but still great wins. The RTP is 96%, which is within the norm.\n\nSymbols and Wilds\n\nThere are nine regular symbols in Defenders of the Realm. The low-value symbols are the cards, 5, J, Q, K, and A, carved in rock jewels. The most rewarding symbols are the four warriors, with the Nordic ones having higher rewards than the epic ones. The word Wild in front of a half-closed door is the wild card, which pays and replaces all other symbols except the special ones. The scatter, on the other hand, is a chest. If three or more appear, the Pick Bonus will be activated, a special multilevel game where players will be faced with different rows containing covered symbols. Players will have to click on them and reveal the type of reward.\n\nBonus Games\n\nIn Defenders of the Realm, the Pick Bonus feature is activated if three or more scatter symbols appear. Essentially, players will be faced with different rows containing covered symbols. Players will have to click on them and reveal the type of reward. The bonuses can either be a variable payout or a payout that allows players to advance to a new level. When players reach the last level, they may encounter the X, which will immediately end the game, or reveal the 2x symbol, doubling all payouts. Defenders of the Realm also features a special function called Beat Boxes. If the frames are aligned on all reels, the Locked Wilds feature will be activated: 10 free spins during which an extended wild card will appear, sometimes with a 2x multiplier.\n\n        \n            ",

Defenders of the Realm seamlessly merges Nordic traditions with the epic. The story revolves around four warriors who use their special powers and weapons, such as Thor's hammer and Excalibur, to defend the city against the forces of evil. The game board is represented by an altar façade, with the protagonists' effigies placed on top and a city in the background with futuristic lines but also typical references to Arabic architecture. The sound effects are accompanied by an intense and invigorating music, which is not intrusive but complements some of the graphical animations. The play and autoplay buttons are located on the left, while the betting level can be set on the bottom and the menu can be accessed through the \"+\" sign.\n\nFeatures of Defenders of the Realm\n\nThe board is a simple 5x4 with 20 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is €0.20 and the maximum is €200. One can decide to set a variable number of automatic spins and choose some playing limits. The volatility is high, with less frequent but still great wins. The RTP is within the norm, equal to 96%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nThere are nine regular symbols. The cards, 5, J, Q, K, and A, carved in rock jewels, have low values. The most rewarding symbols are the four warriors, with the Nordic ones having higher rewards than the epic ones.\n\nThe word Wild in front of a half-closed door is our wild card, which pays and replaces all other symbols except the special ones.\n\nThe scatter, on the other hand, is a chest. If three or more appear, the Pick Bonus will be activated, a special multilevel game. Essentially, we will be faced with different rows containing covered symbols. We will have to click on them and discover the type of reward:\n\n- Blue corresponds to a variable payout.\n- Green corresponds to a payout and allows us to advance to a new level.\n\nWhen we reach the last level, we may encounter the X, which will immediately end the game, or reveal the 2x symbol, doubling all payouts.\n\nThe surprises, however, do not end here, as Defenders of the Realm also features a function called Beat Boxes. Essentially, each time a horn appears in a position, it will be framed with a color that will remain in subsequent spins. If a winning combination occurs, the payout will be doubled, and the frame will disappear.\n\nIf the frames are aligned on all reels, the Locked Wilds feature will be activated: 10 free spins during which an extended wild card will appear, sometimes with a 2x multiplier.\n            ",

Defenders of the Realm seamlessly merges Nordic traditions with the epic. The story revolves around four warriors who use their special powers and weapons, such as Thor's hammer and Excalibur, to defend the city against the forces of evil. The game board is represented by an altar façade, with the protagonists' effigies placed on top and a city in the background with futuristic lines but also typical references to Arabic architecture. The sound effects are accompanied by an intense and invigorating music, which is not intrusive but complements some of the graphical animations. The play and autoplay buttons are located on the left, while the betting level can be set on the bottom and the menu can be accessed through the \"+\" sign.\n\nFeatures of Defenders of the Realm\n\nThe board is a simple 5x4 with 20 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is €0.20 and the maximum is €200. One can decide to set a variable number of automatic spins and choose some playing limits. The volatility is high, with less frequent but still great wins. The RTP is within the norm, equal to 96%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\n\nThere are nine regular symbols. The cards, 5, J, Q, K, and A, carved in rock jewels, have low values. The most rewarding symbols are the four warriors, with the Nordic ones having higher rewards than the epic ones.\n\nThe word Wild in front of a half-closed door is our wild card, which pays and replaces all other symbols except the special ones.\n\nThe scatter, on the other hand, is a chest. If three or more appear, the Pick Bonus will be activated, a special multilevel game. Essentially, we will be faced with different rows containing covered symbols. We will have to click on them and discover the type of reward:\n\n- Blue corresponds to a variable payout.\n- Green corresponds to a payout and allows us to advance to a new level.\n\nWhen we reach the last level, we may encounter the X, which will immediately end the game, or reveal the 2x symbol, doubling all payouts.\n\nThe surprises, however, do not end here, as Defenders of the Realm also features a function called Beat Boxes. Essentially, each time a horn appears in a position, it will be framed with a color that will remain in subsequent spins. If a winning combination occurs, the payout will be doubled, and the frame will disappear.\n\nIf the frames are aligned on all reels, the Locked Wilds feature will be activated: 10 free spins during which an extended wild card will appear, sometimes with a 2x multiplier.\n            ",
