Il primo impatto con la slot è una presentazione animata che assomiglia molto a quelle tipiche di film e programmi tv. Dopo l’introduzione (che possiamo anche decidere di saltare), la schermata si apre sulla griglia di gioco. Lo sfondo è una città notturna con così tante luci da sembrare quasi dorata. Ai lati della griglia abbiamo due pannelli, quello sulla destra ci augura buona fortuna, quello di sinistra è uno speciale accumulatore di cui vedremo la funzione più in là.\nIn basso troviamo diversi tasti, dallo Start al variatore di puntata, oltre a quello che ci permette di accedere al menù interno.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nIn 3 Diamonds FashionTV la griglia ha 4 rulli e 3 linee. Si vince associando simboli identici e adiacenti a partire dal rullo di sinistra  e procedendo verso destra. Ci sono sino a 108 modi per vincere e nel caso di più combinazioni sulla stessa linea, verrà pagata solo la vincita più alta. Attraverso il variatore di puntata possiamo decidere l’importo da scommettere per ogni giro. Contando che di un singolo gettone è di 0,01 € e la giocata minima allo step 1 ne richiede 50, allora un singolo spin ci costerà 0,50 €.\nUno dei punti di forza di questa slot è di sicuro il valore RTP molto alto, pari al 97,34%. La volatilità è media.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nPer conoscere il valore dei simboli, ci basterà puntare il mouse su ognuno di essi quando i rulli sono fermi. La scritta Bar ha un valore basso, a seguire troviamo le fragole, la stella e l’orologio. Per iniziare a vedere qualche cifra davvero interessante bisogna però puntare sull’auto, sulla carta di credito o sui lingotti, a meno che non si abbia la fortuna di vedere comparire il diamante!\nAbbiamo poi due simboli speciali con la doppia funzione di Wild e Scatter. Si tratta delle bottiglie di champagne, che sono simboli a espansione e quando compaiono vanno a coprire l’intero rullo. Oltretutto ricompensano con dei Free Spins. Il numero di giri gratuiti dipende dal rullo in cui compare il simbolo.\nVeniamo ora alla funzione denominata Special Prize: a ogni vincita ottenuta da noi, ma anche dagli altri giocatori che in quel momento sono su 3 Diamonds FashionTV, un importo extra andrà a rimpinguare un contatore speciale con diversi livelli. Dopo aver raggiunto la soglia del primo, ci verrà chiesto se incassare o passare al livello successivo. Abbiamo trenta secondi per decidere. Durante questo tempo il premio potrà aumentare in base alle giocate degli altri utenti, ma anche diminuire nel caso un altro giocatore ha raggiunto il nostro stesso traguardo e deciderà di ritirare il premio prima di noi.\n",

The first impact with the slot is an animated presentation that looks very similar to those typical of movies and TV shows. After the introduction (which we can also decide to skip), the screen opens onto the game grid. The background is a nighttime city with so many lights that it almost looks golden. On the sides of the grid we have two panels, the one on the right wishes us good luck, while the one on the left is a special accumulator whose function we will see later on. \nAt the bottom we find various buttons, from the Start to the bet variable, as well as the one that allows us to access the internal menu. \n\nSlot Features\nIn 3 Diamonds FashionTV the grid has 4 reels and 3 rows. We win by associating identical and adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. There are up to 108 ways to win and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, only the highest win will be paid. Through the bet variable we can decide the amount to bet for each spin. Considering that a single token is worth 0.01€ and the minimum bet at step 1 requires 50, then a single spin will cost us 0.50€.\nOne of the strengths of this slot is definitely the very high RTP value, equal to 97.34%. The volatility is medium. \n\nSymbols and Features\nTo know the value of the symbols, we just need to point the mouse on each of them when the reels are still. The Bar text has a low value, followed by the strawberries, star, and clock. However, to start seeing some really interesting figures, we must bet on the car, on the credit card or on the ingots, unless we are lucky enough to see the diamond appear!\n\nWe then have two special symbols with the double function of Wild and Scatter. These are the champagne bottles, which are expansion symbols and when they appear they cover the whole reel. Moreover, they reward us with Free Spins. The number of free spins depends on the reel where the symbol appears. \n\nNow let's come to the function called Special Prize: for each win we obtain, but also from other players who are currently on 3 Diamonds FashionTV, an extra amount goes to a special counter with different levels. After reaching the threshold of the first level, we will be asked whether to cash out or move on to the next level. We have thirty seconds to decide.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nRTP value and volatility of the game\nGame grid and betting options\nSymbols and their values\nWild and Scatter symbols and their functions\nSpecial Prize feature and its mechanics\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: 3Diamonds FashionTV\nThe first thing that catches the eye when we face 3 Diamonds FashionTV is the originality of the theme: a TV channel dedicated to luxury and everything that surrounds it. The first impact with the slot is an animated presentation that looks very similar to those typical of movies and TV shows. After the introduction (which we can also decide to skip), the screen opens onto the game grid. The background is a nighttime city with so many lights that it almost looks golden. On the sides of the grid we have two panels, the one on the right wishes us good luck, while the one on the left is a special accumulator whose function we will see later on. \nAt the bottom we find various buttons, from the Start to the bet variable, as well as the one that allows us to access the internal menu. \n\nSlot Features\nIn 3 Diamonds FashionTV the grid has 4 reels and 3 rows. We win by associating identical and adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. There are up to 108 ways to win and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, only the highest win will be paid. Through the bet variable we can decide the amount to bet for each spin. Considering that a single token is worth 0.01€ and the minimum bet at step 1 requires 50, then a single spin will cost us 0.50€.\nOne of the strengths of this slot is definitely the very high RTP value, equal to 97.34%. The volatility is medium. \n\nSymbols and Features\nTo know the value of the symbols, we just need to point the mouse on each of them when the reels are still. The Bar text has a low value, followed by the strawberries, star, and clock. However, to start seeing some really interesting figures, we must bet on the car, on the credit card or on the ingots, unless we are lucky enough to see the diamond appear!\n\nWe then have two special symbols with the double function of Wild and Scatter. These are the champagne bottles, which are expansion symbols and when they appear they cover the whole reel. Moreover, they reward us with Free Spins. The number of free spins depends on the reel where the symbol appears. \n\nNow let's come to the function called Special Prize: for each win we obtain, but also from other players who are currently on 3 Diamonds FashionTV, an extra amount goes to a special counter with different levels. After reaching the threshold of the first level, we will be asked whether to cash out or move on to the next level. We have thirty seconds to decide. During this time, the prize may increase based on the plays of other users, but also decrease if another player has reached our same goal and decides to withdraw the prize before us.\n            ",

The first impact with the slot is an animated presentation that looks very similar to those typical of movies and TV shows. After the introduction (which we can also decide to skip), the screen opens onto the game grid. The background is a nighttime city with so many lights that it almost looks golden. On the sides of the grid we have two panels, the one on the right wishes us good luck, while the one on the left is a special accumulator whose function we will see later on. \nAt the bottom we find various buttons, from the Start to the bet variable, as well as the one that allows us to access the internal menu. \n\nSlot Features\nIn 3 Diamonds FashionTV the grid has 4 reels and 3 rows. We win by associating identical and adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. There are up to 108 ways to win and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, only the highest win will be paid. Through the bet variable we can decide the amount to bet for each spin. Considering that a single token is worth 0.01€ and the minimum bet at step 1 requires 50, then a single spin will cost us 0.50€.\nOne of the strengths of this slot is definitely the very high RTP value, equal to 97.34%. The volatility is medium. \n\nSymbols and Features\nTo know the value of the symbols, we just need to point the mouse on each of them when the reels are still. The Bar text has a low value, followed by the strawberries, star, and clock. However, to start seeing some really interesting figures, we must bet on the car, on the credit card or on the ingots, unless we are lucky enough to see the diamond appear!\n\nWe then have two special symbols with the double function of Wild and Scatter. These are the champagne bottles, which are expansion symbols and when they appear they cover the whole reel. Moreover, they reward us with Free Spins. The number of free spins depends on the reel where the symbol appears. \n\nNow let's come to the function called Special Prize: for each win we obtain, but also from other players who are currently on 3 Diamonds FashionTV, an extra amount goes to a special counter with different levels. After reaching the threshold of the first level, we will be asked whether to cash out or move on to the next level. We have thirty seconds to decide. During this time, the prize may increase based on the plays of other users, but also decrease if another player has reached our same goal and decides to withdraw the prize before us.\n            ",

The first impact with the slot is an animated presentation that looks very similar to those typical of movies and TV shows. After the introduction (which we can also decide to skip), the screen opens onto the game grid. The background is a nighttime city with so many lights that it almost looks golden. On the sides of the grid we have two panels, the one on the right wishes us good luck, while the one on the left is a special accumulator whose function we will see later on. \nAt the bottom we find various buttons, from the Start to the bet variable, as well as the one that allows us to access the internal menu. \n\nSlot Features\nIn 3 Diamonds FashionTV the grid has 4 reels and 3 rows. We win by associating identical and adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. There are up to 108 ways to win and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, only the highest win will be paid. Through the bet variable we can decide the amount to bet for each spin. Considering that a single token is worth 0.01€ and the minimum bet at step 1 requires 50, then a single spin will cost us 0.50€.\nOne of the strengths of this slot is definitely the very high RTP value, equal to 97.34%. The volatility is medium. \n\nSymbols and Features\nTo know the value of the symbols, we just need to point the mouse on each of them when the reels are still. The Bar text has a low value, followed by the strawberries, star, and clock. However, to start seeing some really interesting figures, we must bet on the car, on the credit card or on the ingots, unless we are lucky enough to see the diamond appear!\n\nWe then have two special symbols with the double function of Wild and Scatter. These are the champagne bottles, which are expansion symbols and when they appear they cover the whole reel. Moreover, they reward us with Free Spins. The number of free spins depends on the reel where the symbol appears. \n\nNow let's come to the function called Special Prize: for each win we obtain, but also from other players who are currently on 3 Diamonds FashionTV, an extra amount goes to a special counter with different levels. After reaching the threshold of the first level, we will be asked whether to cash out or move on to the next level. We have thirty seconds to decide. During this time, the prize may increase based on the plays of other users, but also decrease if another player has reached our same goal and decides to withdraw the prize before us.\n        ",
