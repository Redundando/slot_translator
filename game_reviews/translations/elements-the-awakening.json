All in colors that are rather dark but well blended together, making the background pleasant and easy on the eyes.\n\nMoving on to the slot reel, the classic symbols are replaced by some rocks that enclose the natural elements such as drafts of air, water drops, burning coals, or lightning bolts. Along with these, there are also special symbols represented as water beings, fire and electricity golems, and air dragons.\n\nElements is visually unique and out of the ordinary. As for the sound, there is little to say. In fact, there is no musical background accompanying the gameplay except for solemn music that is heard only during certain combinations. The sounds, although generic, are in line with the fantastic setting of the slot.\n\nBut now let's move from the aesthetic to the technical side of Elements.\n\nElements: How to Play\n\nAlthough the absence of a real game grid could make us think differently, Elements actually uses a very common 5x3 mechanism in online slots. The fifteen symbols that appear with each play are arranged in combinations according to the twenty paylines.\n\nThe real novelty comes in the cascading mechanism: we are not talking about falling reels, but symbols that fall from above.

For this reason, we can instead choose to recommend other slots from the same developer that have some technical aspects in common. Fruit Case, also from NetEnt, also enjoys a combined win system with attached prize, for those who want to try something fresher and lighter after the epicness of Elements.\n            ",

The review covers its features, visual aspects, sound, gameplay, and a recommendation for other similar slots.\n\nNetEnt: A Top-Ranked Online Slot Developer\n\nNetEnt is highly regarded in the world of online slots due to its versatility in creating various themes and unique games.\n\nFantasy Interpretation of Natural Elements\n\nElements is an online slot game that features four natural elements, including air, water, fire, and earth, presented in a fantasy setting. The backdrop includes mountainous views, valleys, and an active volcano. The slot reel's symbols are composed of rocks with the various natural elements enclosed within them, along with special symbols such as water beings, fire and electricity golems, and air dragons.\n\nCascading Mechanism\n\nElements features a cascading mechanism where symbols fall from above instead of the reels. In the event of a winning combination, the symbols involved in the combination will get absorbed by a central talisman that will load with energy. Other symbols then fall from above, creating a chance for a concatenated win. To fill the talisman, players must achieve four concatenated wins.\n\nConcatenated Wins\n\nElements has a concatenated win system where players can receive multiple wins in a single turn. This system involves the cascading mechanism, where symbols that form a winning combination will get absorbed by a talisman, and new symbols will fall from above, giving players the opportunity to get more winning combinations.\n\nSimilar Slots to Elements\n\nFinding slots similar to Elements might be challenging, considering its unique theme. But for players who enjoy the concatenated win system, Fruit Case is an ideal option. Fruit Case, also from NetEnt, is a lighter game that makes for an excellent follow-up to the adventure and excitement of Elements.\n\n        \n            ",

The cascading mechanism uses symbols falling from above and involves symbols absorbed by a central talisman that will load with energy, while other symbols fall from above and give the opportunity to obtain concatenated wins. To completely fill the talisman, it will be necessary to obtain four concatenated wins, a challenge in itself but one that will reward the patience and luck of players who manage to complete it.\n\nVisual Design\n\nElements: The Awakening's visual aspect is atypical for slots since it focuses on the four natural elements: air, water, fire, and earth, and does so in their most fantasy-centric interpretation. The backdrop captures typical landscapes of the genre with glimpses of mountains, valleys, a cliff, and even an active volcano. The slot reel features rocks that enclose the natural elements such as drafts of air, water drops, burning coals, or lightning bolts, and special symbols represented as water beings, fire and electricity golems, and air dragons, making Elements visually unique and out of the ordinary. Although the colors are rather dark, the graphics are well blended together, making the background pleasant and easy on the eyes.\n\nTheme\n\nThe theme of Elements: The Awakening is based on the natural elements on which the Earth is formed, including air, water, fire, and earth. The game takes a fantasy-centric approach to this theme, offering players a one-of-a-kind experience not found in other slot games.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nElements: The Awakening features special symbols represented as water beings, fire and electricity golems, and air dragons. These symbols contribute to the unique gaming experience by adding depth to the game's theme and offering more opportunities to win.\n\nPayout Potential\n\nThe reward system in Elements: The Awakening is unique, offering a central talisman that will load with energy every time a cascading win occurs. To completely fill the talisman, it will be necessary to obtain four concatenated wins, which can be a challenge. However, players that manage to complete this challenge will be rewarded with significant payouts, making Elements a worthwhile slot game to try.\n\n        \n            ",

Elements certainly belongs to this second category, using as its theme the elements on which the Earth is based (wind, fire, and more), which we will see in detail in this review.\n\nSo enough talk, let's start our analysis by talking about the visual aspect of this game.\n\nElements: all elements accounted for\n\nNetent's Elements has a rather atypical setting for slots, as it focuses on the four natural elements: air, water, fire, and earth, and does so in their most fantasy-centric interpretation.\n\nLet's start with the backdrop which captures typical landscapes of the genre with glimpses of mountains, valleys, a cliff, and even an active volcano. All in colors that are rather dark but well blended together, making the background pleasant and easy on the eyes.\n\nMoving on to the slot reel, the classic symbols are replaced by some rocks that enclose the natural elements such as drafts of air, water drops, burning coals, or lightning bolts. Along with these, there are also special symbols represented as water beings, fire and electricity golems, and air dragons.\n\nElements is visually unique and out of the ordinary. As for the sound, there is little to say. In fact, there is no musical background accompanying the gameplay except for solemn music that is heard only during certain combinations. The sounds, although generic, are in line with the fantastic setting of the slot.\n\nBut now let's move from the aesthetic to the technical side of Elements.\n\nElements: How to Play\n\nAlthough the absence of a real game grid could make us think differently, Elements actually uses a very common 5x3 mechanism in online slots. The fifteen symbols that appear with each play are arranged in combinations according to the twenty paylines.\n\nThe real novelty comes in the cascading mechanism: we are not talking about falling reels, but symbols that fall from above. In the in the case of a winning combination, the involved symbols will be absorbed by a central talisman that will load with energy, while other symbols fall from above and give the opportunity to obtain concatenated wins.\n\nTo completely fill the talisman, it will be necessary to obtain four concatenated wins, a challenge in itself but one that will reward the patience and luck of players who manage to complete it.\n\nIn short: we are facing an original game in many ways and one that proves to be certainly more interesting than many other more inexperienced titles that can be found online.\n\nSimilar Games to Elements\n\nIt is not easy to find titles that share the theme of this slot, as it is particularly unique. For this reason, we can instead choose to recommend other slots from the same developer that have some technical aspects in common. Fruit Case, also from NetEnt, also enjoys a combined win system with attached prize, for those who want to try something fresher and lighter after the epicness of Elements.\n            ",

Elements certainly belongs to this second category, using as its theme the elements on which the Earth is based (wind, fire, and more), which we will see in detail in this review.\n\nSo enough talk, let's start our analysis by talking about the visual aspect of this game.\n\nElements: all elements accounted for\n\nNetent's Elements has a rather atypical setting for slots, as it focuses on the four natural elements: air, water, fire, and earth, and does so in their most fantasy-centric interpretation.\n\nLet's start with the backdrop which captures typical landscapes of the genre with glimpses of mountains, valleys, a cliff, and even an active volcano. All in colors that are rather dark but well blended together, making the background pleasant and easy on the eyes.\n\nMoving on to the slot reel, the classic symbols are replaced by some rocks that enclose the natural elements such as drafts of air, water drops, burning coals, or lightning bolts. Along with these, there are also special symbols represented as water beings, fire and electricity golems, and air dragons.\n\nElements is visually unique and out of the ordinary. As for the sound, there is little to say. In fact, there is no musical background accompanying the gameplay except for solemn music that is heard only during certain combinations. The sounds, although generic, are in line with the fantastic setting of the slot.\n\nBut now let's move from the aesthetic to the technical side of Elements.\n\nElements: How to Play\n\nAlthough the absence of a real game grid could make us think differently, Elements actually uses a very common 5x3 mechanism in online slots. The fifteen symbols that appear with each play are arranged in combinations according to the twenty paylines.\n\nThe real novelty comes in the cascading mechanism: we are not talking about falling reels, but symbols that fall from above. In the in the case of a winning combination, the involved symbols will be absorbed by a central talisman that will load with energy, while other symbols fall from above and give the opportunity to obtain concatenated wins.\n\nTo completely fill the talisman, it will be necessary to obtain four concatenated wins, a challenge in itself but one that will reward the patience and luck of players who manage to complete it.\n\nIn short: we are facing an original game in many ways and one that proves to be certainly more interesting than many other more inexperienced titles that can be found online.\n\nSimilar Games to Elements\n\nIt is not easy to find titles that share the theme of this slot, as it is particularly unique. For this reason, we can instead choose to recommend other slots from the same developer that have some technical aspects in common. Fruit Case, also from NetEnt, also enjoys a combined win system with attached prize, for those who want to try something fresher and lighter after the epicness of Elements.\n            ",
