Specifically, we will be discussing a recent version created by Playtech, which has unveiled Age of the Gods: Goddess of Wisdom. This is a 5-reel, 20-payline gaming solution that focuses on a female figure of great respect: Athena. The theme is based on Greek mythology and emphasizes its Battle Game function, which allows players to play with 3 modes of free spins and expanding symbols. Players have the ability to enjoy 10 free spins, multipliers up to 4x or 14 free spins combined with a 2x multiplier. To top it off, there are also 4 progressive jackpots up for grabs, which are a bit of a leitmotif that the provider offers for the titles in this saga. Let's take a closer look at the features of this machine that boasts an RTP of 94.94%.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nLet's start our review with the graphics of this slot: we are on the doorstep of an ancient Greek temple, which appears in the background. Here is where the grid is positioned, which comes to life after every spin with a series of ad hoc designed symbols. Gorgoneion, olive branches, helmets and armor, sandals and much more alternate. The head of the Gorgon is the symbol with the highest value, reaching a total value of 5,000 times your bet if you manage to get 5 symbols on a payline.\n\nThe central figure of the gameplay, however, is Athena, chosen as a wild symbol and the true muse of the entire story: if she appears on the central 3 reels, she can replace all game symbols except for the Scatter. The latter is represented by an owl: when it appears 3 or more times anywhere on the grid, it activates the Battle Game function, where you can choose between 3 modes of free spin.\n\n• With Gorgoneion, you'll get 10 free spins;\n• The helmet allows you to have 7 spins and a 4x multiplier;\n• Finally, with the armor, you'll get 14 spins and a 2x multiplier.\n\nIt should also be noted that the chosen symbol will replace the other two symbols mentioned, offering a series of advantages that the gamer should be able to exploit with a little luck.\n\nWe also mentioned the 4 progressive jackpots that are the real icing on the cake. They are activated completely randomly and on any spin: you will find yourself in front of 20 gold coins to choose from until you find 3 identical ones. The prizes are Power, Extra Power, Super Power, and Ultimate Power.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Age of the Gods: Goddess of Wisdom slot\n\nWe can therefore say that Age of the Gods: Goddess of Wisdom is a slot with an RTP that is average, or rather just below the highest average. The graphics are not the best in general compared to the titles that make up the saga, but it has gameplay that can offer interesting surprises.",

Specifically, we'll be discussing a recent version developed by Playtech, Age of the Gods: Goddess of Wisdom. This is a 5-reel, 20-payline game that focuses on the impressive female figure of Athena. The theme of Greek mythology is present, with an emphasis on the Battle Game function where 3 modes of free spins and expanding symbols are available. The player can enjoy 10 free spins, up to 4x multipliers or 14 free spins combined with a 2x multiplier. And to top it off, there are also 4 progressive jackpots up for grabs, which are a bit of a leitmotif that the provider offers for the titles in this saga. Let's take a closer look at the features of this machine, which has an RTP of 94.94%.\n\nGame Graphics and Symbols\n\nLet's start our review with the graphics of this slot: we're at the gates of an ancient Greek temple, which appears in the background. Here, the grid is positioned and comes to life with a series of specially designed symbols. Gorgoneion, Olive Branches, Helmets and Armor, Sandals and much more alternate. The head of the Gorgon is the highest value symbol, reaching a total value of 5,000 times your bet if you manage to get 5 symbols on a payline.\n\nHowever, the central figure of the gameplay is Athena, chosen as the wild symbol and true muse of the entire story: if she appears on the 3 middle reels, she can replace all game symbols except the Scatter. The latter has the appearance of an owl: when it lands 3 or more times anywhere on the grid, the Battle Game function is activated, where you can choose from 3 modes of free spins.\n\n• With Gorgoneion, you'll get 10 free spins;\n• The helmet allows you to have 7 spins and a 4x multiplier;\n• Finally, with the armor, you'll get 14 spins and a 2x multiplier.\n\nIt should also be noted that the chosen symbol will replace the other two symbols mentioned, offering a series of advantages that the gamer will have to be skillful in exploiting with a pinch of luck.\n\nWe've also mentioned the 4 progressive jackpots that are the real icing on the cake. They are activated completely randomly and on any spin: you'll be presented with 20 gold coins to choose from until you find 3 identical ones. The prizes are Power, Extra Power, Super Power, and Ultimate Power.\n\nFinal thoughts on the slot Age of the Gods: Goddess of Wisdom\n\nWe can say that Age of the Gods Goddess of Wisdom is a slot with an RTP that is average, or rather just below the highest average. Its graphics are not the best overall, but even among the titles that make up the saga, it has gameplay that can offer interesting surprises. For experienced gamblers looking for a challenge and a chance to hit the big jackpot, this slot is definitely worth a try.\n            ",

Specifically, we'll be discussing a recent version developed by Playtech, Age of the Gods: Goddess of Wisdom. This is a 5-reel, 20-payline game that focuses on the impressive female figure of Athena. The theme of Greek mythology is present, with an emphasis on the Battle Game function where 3 modes of free spins and expanding symbols are available. The player can enjoy 10 free spins, up to 4x multipliers or 14 free spins combined with a 2x multiplier. And to top it off, there are also 4 progressive jackpots up for grabs, which are a bit of a leitmotif that the provider offers for the titles in this saga. Let's take a closer look at the features of this machine, which has an RTP of 94.94%.\n\nGame Graphics and Symbols\n\nLet's start our review with the graphics of this slot: we're at the gates of an ancient Greek temple, which appears in the background. Here, the grid is positioned and comes to life with a series of specially designed symbols. Gorgoneion, Olive Branches, Helmets and Armor, Sandals and much more alternate. The head of the Gorgon is the highest value symbol, reaching a total value of 5,000 times your bet if you manage to get 5 symbols on a payline.\n\nHowever, the central figure of the gameplay is Athena, chosen as the wild symbol and true muse of the entire story: if she appears on the 3 middle reels, she can replace all game symbols except the Scatter. The latter has the appearance of an owl: when it lands 3 or more times anywhere on the grid, the Battle Game function is activated, where you can choose from 3 modes of free spins.\n\n• With Gorgoneion, you'll get 10 free spins;\n• The helmet allows you to have 7 spins and a 4x multiplier;\n• Finally, with the armor, you'll get 14 spins and a 2x multiplier.\n\nIt should also be noted that the chosen symbol will replace the other two symbols mentioned, offering a series of advantages that the gamer will have to be skillful in exploiting with a pinch of luck.\n\nWe've also mentioned the 4 progressive jackpots that are the real icing on the cake. They are activated completely randomly and on any spin: you'll be presented with 20 gold coins to choose from until you find 3 identical ones. The prizes are Power, Extra Power, Super Power, and Ultimate Power.\n\nFinal thoughts on the slot Age of the Gods: Goddess of Wisdom\n\nWe can say that Age of the Gods Goddess of Wisdom is a slot with an RTP that is average, or rather just below the highest average. Its graphics are not the best overall, but even among the titles that make up the saga, it has gameplay that can offer interesting surprises. For experienced gamblers looking for a challenge and a chance to hit the big jackpot, this slot is definitely worth a try.\n            ",
