The game rules are straightforward: spin the reels starting with a minimum bet of €0.10 up to €500.00 per spin. The objective is to land 3 identical symbols on any of the 5 paylines to make a winning combination. The game has an RTP of 95.10% and very high volatility.\n\nPayout\n\nThe payout table is in ascending order, starting from cherries, oranges, BAR, watermelons, bells, stars, standard 7s, and 7s Fire, which is the game's Wild symbol and worth 250x the bet. The game rewards winning combinations up to 1,250 times the bet during the base game and 625 times for the High Roller spins.\n\nVolatility\n\nThe game has very high volatility, which means that winning combinations may be scarce but worth larger payouts.\n\nHigh Roller Bet\n\n7s On Fire offers another type of bet, the 5 High Roller spins. In this mode, the Double 7 Wild can replace all other symbols, not just the single Lucky 7, and winning combinations pay out less than in the base game. Nevertheless, the High Roller spins can offer the game's best wins, paying 250 times the bet in the base game and 125 times during the Free Spins.\n\nAlternatives\n\nThe game's base game may be considered boring by some players, but the High Roller spins offer more potential wins. If you enjoy fruit-themed slot games, you may want to try other titles like Playson's Fruit Xtreme or NetEnt's Fruit Case. These games offer more dynamic gameplay and are available in demo mode or with real money at online casinos.\n\n        \n            ",
