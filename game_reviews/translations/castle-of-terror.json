With a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.72%, high volatility, and a maximum win potential of 61720x, every round will be more terrifying than the last!\n\nGame Details\nCastle of Terror is a horror-themed video slot with 6 reels, 4 rows, and 4,096 paylines. Wins are awarded by guessing two or more symbols in succession, starting from the leftmost reel to the right.\n\nYou can enter the haunted castle with bets ranging from 0.20 credits up to a maximum of 15 credits per spin while keeping in mind that the RTP is 96.73% with high volatility.\n\nCastle of Terror Symbolism\nLow-paying symbols include 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A, offering 0.3x to 0.5x of your bet if you guess six on the reels. The higher-paying symbols include four key characters of the Castle of Terror:\n\nThe Gardener, The Maid, The Gentleman, pay from 0.6x to 1x of your bet for a spread of six icons;\nThe Lady represents a well-paying symbol that pays out 50 times your bet for a spread of six.\n\nWild symbols appear as a W in the Holy Water feature and replace all others except the Bonus Scatter, represented by the Castle itself. The golden variant allows you to activate the enhanced version of the free spins bonus.\n\nCastle of Terror Slot Features\nTo unleash the real potential of this title, you have to wait to activate the following extra bonus features:\n\nHoly Water Feature – Randomly, on any spin, the slot can reveal two or more positions on the blessed four central reels with Holy Water. All characters in these positions will transform into Wilds, increasing the win multiplier by 1x. Of course, the Wild can substitute any standard icon, if necessary.\nSilver Castle Scatter and Gold Castle Megascatter Feature – Landing three or more Scatters on the reels launches 12 Castle of Terror free spins plus three additional spins for each Scatter after the third (if possible). If only one of the activation icons is a Golden Castle, you will get enhanced free spins.\nBonus Buy Feature – You can buy 12 free spins for 70 times of your current bet or 12 enhanced free spins for 200x. Enhanced FS has an initial win multiplier of 2x, which increases by 2x every time a character transforms into a Wild icon.\n\nWhy Play Castle of Terror Online Slot\nI believe this slot is the perfect combination of everything we can't wait to test every Halloween. Thanks to a unique spectral theme used for the game's graphic layout, every detail, even on the reels, has been crafted with extreme care. Furthermore, the high volatility in combination with the Holy Water mechanic and two exciting free spin features complete this BGT terror gem.\n\nFAQs\nCan I play Castle of Terror slot for free?\nYes, Slotjava is the perfect place to test Castle of Terror without any required registration. Any online casino site that collaborates with Big Time Gaming provides dual play modes, free and real money.\n\nCan I play Castle of Terror slot on mobile?\nYes, this video slot is optimized for mobile devices and can be loaded onto any iOS and Android device.\n\nHow can I win playing Castle of Terror?\nThis is a licensed title that generates random results, but you can take advantage of both the no deposit welcome bonus upon registering at a new online casino and consult the paytable to discover how and how much you can win.\n            ",
