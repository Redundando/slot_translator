    "original_text": "\nFootball: Champions Cup\nIl calcio è forse lo sport più famoso del mondo, capace di far battere il cuore a milioni di spettatori e di unire interi popoli, soprattutto quando a scendere in campo sono le nazionali. Football: Champions Cup ripropone una selezione di squadre gloriose provenienti da tutto il mondo, come ad esempio Brasile, Francia, Germania, Argentina, Uruguay solo per citarne alcune. Il primo passo per giocare a Football: Champions Cup sarà proprio quello di scegliere la squadra con cui giocare, dopodiché si aprirà il sipario. La griglia di gioco si trova sul campo e sullo sfondo si trova lo stadio pieno di spettatori. La grafica spettacolare ci fa entrare nel vivo della sfida, il sottofondo musicale è naturalmente d’atto da cori da stadio a sottolineare ogni spin.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa NetEnt ha deciso di offrirci una griglia dal tono classico, con 5 rulli e 3 linee e 20 linee di pagamento. La puntata minima è di 0,01 €, mentre quella massima è di 100 €, modificabile anche attraverso gli 8 livelli della scommessa. Volendo, è possibile impostare tra i 10 e i 1.000 giri automatici. Completa il tutto un RTP di tutto rispetto pari al 96,82% e una volatilità media.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nUno dei tanti pregi di questa slot è la simulazione della fase ad eliminazione diretta del torneo durante i Free Spins e farci provare l’ebrezza dei calci di rigori grazie ai Bonus. Prima però è utile soffermarci sui simboli che potrete trovare in Football: Champions Cup. Quelli con valore più basso sono legati alle carte da gioco dal 10 all’asso, a seguire in ordine troviamo il logo del fischietto, il guanto, lo scarpino, la maglia e lo stemma con il calciatore in azione. Il simbolo Wild, costituito da un pallone da calcio, oltre a ripagare con cifre considerevoli, sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter e il Bonus. Di tanto in tanto sullo schermo possono apparire tra i 2 e i 5 Overly Wild, ossia dei palloni che si poggiano su alcuni simboli regolari trasformandoli in Wild. La coppa è il nostro simbolo Scatter, se ne appaiono 3 sui rulli 2, 3 e 4 si attivano i Free Spins, impostati come un vero e proprio torneo a partire dagli ottavi di finale. Per raggiungere la finale avremo quindi a disposizione 4 Free Spins. I Wild Gol di colore rosso e blu rappresentano i gol della nostra squadra e quelli dell’avversario. Più gol segniamo, più avremo possibilità di raggiungere la finale che, in caso di vittoria, paga con un premio molto elevato.\nCon 3 simboli Bonus accederemo invece a 5 calci di rigore che in caso di parità potrebbero andare ad oltranza. Il gioco consta di due momenti: nel primo dovremo tirare un rigore, nel secondo avremo il compito di pararlo.\n",

Football: Champions Cup offers a selection of glorious teams from all over the world, such as Brazil, France, Germany, Argentina, Uruguay, just to name a few. The first step to playing Football: Champions Cup will be to choose the team to play with, after which the curtain will open. The game grid is located on the field and in the background is the stadium full of spectators. The spectacular graphics immerse us in the heart of the challenge, the music is naturally suitable for stadium choirs to underline every spin.\n\nSlot Features\nNetEnt has decided to offer us a classic grid, with 5 reels and 3 lines and 20 paylines. The minimum bet is € 0.01, while the maximum bet is € 100, also adjustable through the 8 levels of the bet. If desired, between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins can be set. Completing everything is a respectable RTP of 96.82% and average volatility.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\nOne of the many advantages of this slot is the simulation of the tournament's knockout phase during Free Spins and the thrill of penalties thanks to the Bonus. First, however, it is useful to focus on the symbols that you can find in Football: Champions Cup. The ones with the lowest value are linked to the playing cards from 10 to ace, followed in order by the whistle logo, glove, shoe, jersey, and the emblem with the player in action. The Wild symbol, consisting of a soccer ball, not only pays substantial sums, but also replaces all symbols except the Scatter and Bonus. From time to time, between 2 and 5 Overly Wilds can appear on the screen, that is, balls that rest on some regular symbols turning them into Wilds. The cup is our Scatter symbol, if 3 of them appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, Free Spins will be activated, set up like a real tournament, starting from the round of 16. To reach the final, we will have 4 Free Spins available. The red and blue Wild Goals represent the goals of our team and those of the opponent. The more goals we score, the more chances we have of reaching the final, which, in case of victory, pays a very high prize.\n\nWith 3 Bonus symbols, we will instead access 5 penalty kicks that could go on indefinitely in case of a tie.

Football: Champions Cup offers a selection of glorious teams from all over the world, such as Brazil, France, Germany, Argentina, Uruguay, just to name a few. The first step to playing Football: Champions Cup will be to choose the team to play with, after which the curtain will open. The game grid is located on the field and in the background is the stadium full of spectators. The spectacular graphics immerse us in the heart of the challenge, the music is naturally suitable for stadium choirs to underline every spin.\n\nSlot Features\nNetEnt has decided to offer us a classic grid, with 5 reels and 3 lines and 20 paylines. The minimum bet is € 0.01, while the maximum bet is € 100, also adjustable through the 8 levels of the bet. If desired, between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins can be set. Completing everything is a respectable RTP of 96.82% and average volatility.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\nOne of the many advantages of this slot is the simulation of the tournament's knockout phase during Free Spins and the thrill of penalties thanks to the Bonus. First, however, it is useful to focus on the symbols that you can find in Football: Champions Cup. The ones with the lowest value are linked to the playing cards from 10 to ace, followed in order by the whistle logo, glove, shoe, jersey, and the emblem with the player in action. The Wild symbol, consisting of a soccer ball, not only pays substantial sums, but also replaces all symbols except the Scatter and Bonus. From time to time, between 2 and 5 Overly Wilds can appear on the screen, that is, balls that rest on some regular symbols turning them into Wilds. The cup is our Scatter symbol, if 3 of them appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, Free Spins will be activated, set up like a real tournament, starting from the round of 16. To reach the final, we will have 4 Free Spins available. The red and blue Wild Goals represent the goals of our team and those of the opponent. The more goals we score, the more chances we have of reaching the final, which, in case of victory, pays a very high prize.\n\nWith 3 Bonus symbols, we will instead access 5 penalty kicks that could go on indefinitely in case of a tie. The game consists of two moments: in the first, we will have to take a penalty kick, in the second, we will have the task of saving it.\n            ",

Football: Champions Cup offers a selection of glorious teams from all over the world, such as Brazil, France, Germany, Argentina, Uruguay, just to name a few. The first step to playing Football: Champions Cup will be to choose the team to play with, after which the curtain will open. The game grid is located on the field and in the background is the stadium full of spectators. The spectacular graphics immerse us in the heart of the challenge, the music is naturally suitable for stadium choirs to underline every spin.\n\nSlot Features\nNetEnt has decided to offer us a classic grid, with 5 reels and 3 lines and 20 paylines. The minimum bet is € 0.01, while the maximum bet is € 100, also adjustable through the 8 levels of the bet. If desired, between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins can be set. Completing everything is a respectable RTP of 96.82% and average volatility.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\nOne of the many advantages of this slot is the simulation of the tournament's knockout phase during Free Spins and the thrill of penalties thanks to the Bonus. First, however, it is useful to focus on the symbols that you can find in Football: Champions Cup. The ones with the lowest value are linked to the playing cards from 10 to ace, followed in order by the whistle logo, glove, shoe, jersey, and the emblem with the player in action. The Wild symbol, consisting of a soccer ball, not only pays substantial sums, but also replaces all symbols except the Scatter and Bonus. From time to time, between 2 and 5 Overly Wilds can appear on the screen, that is, balls that rest on some regular symbols turning them into Wilds. The cup is our Scatter symbol, if 3 of them appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, Free Spins will be activated, set up like a real tournament, starting from the round of 16. To reach the final, we will have 4 Free Spins available. The red and blue Wild Goals represent the goals of our team and those of the opponent. The more goals we score, the more chances we have of reaching the final, which, in case of victory, pays a very high prize.\n\nWith 3 Bonus symbols, we will instead access 5 penalty kicks that could go on indefinitely in case of a tie. The game consists of two moments: in the first, we will have to take a penalty kick, in the second, we will have the task of saving it.\n            ",
