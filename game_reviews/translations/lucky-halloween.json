You can modify your bet by clicking on the + and - buttons, starting from a minimum of 0.20€ to a maximum limit of 500.00€.\n\nWhich are the main symbols to keep an eye on?\n\nThe icons of Lucky Halloween\n\nIn this no-download slot, the symbols not to miss are: a witch hat, a bottle of magic potion, a blindfolded black cat, a cupcake with bat wings, a pumpkin filled with gold coins, a cauldron full of colored balls, a haunted castle, and a ghostly motorcycle from Pumpkin Biker.\n\nHow much are these icons worth?\n\nThe Pumpkin pays 400 times the bet for 5 symbols together on the reels. This icon is also the wild icon, and therefore, it substitutes other symbols to create greater winnings.\n\nThe Motorcycle is the second symbol with the best payout, paying 320 times the bet for 5 symbols.\n\nThe Witch Hat is the third symbol with the best payout, paying 160 times the bet for 5 identical icons.\n\nThe Blindfolded Black Cat pays 140 times the bet for 5 symbols.\n\nThe Bottle with Magic Potion pays up to 120 times your bet.\n\nThe Enchanted Cupcake assigns up to 100 times your bet for 5 symbols.\n\nEven the cards in this game are not to be underestimated:\n\nThe Yellow Ace rewards 80 times your bet.\n\nThe Orange King rewards up to 60 times your bet.\n\nThe Purple Queen rewards up to 40 times your bet.\n\nThe Green Jack pays up to 30 times your bet.\n\nThe Blue Jack 10 pays up to 20 times the bet for 5 identical symbols.\n\nFrightening special features\n\nThe Pumpkin Biker can transform the wheels into special reels filled with precious symbols.

This icon is also the wild icon, and therefore, it substitutes other symbols to create greater winnings.\n\nThe Motorcycle is the second symbol with the best payout, paying 320 times the bet for 5 symbols.\n\nThe Witch Hat is the third symbol with the best payout, paying 160 times the bet for 5 identical icons.\n\nThe Blindfolded Black Cat pays 140 times the bet for 5 symbols.\n\nThe Bottle with Magic Potion pays up to 120 times your bet.\n\nThe Enchanted Cupcake assigns up to 100 times your bet for 5 symbols.\n\nEven the cards in this game are not to be underestimated:\n\nThe Yellow Ace rewards 80 times your bet.\n\nThe Orange King rewards up to 60 times your bet.\n\nThe Purple Queen rewards up to 40 times your bet.\n\nThe Green Jack pays up to 30 times your bet.\n\nThe Blue Jack 10 pays up to 20 times the bet for 5 identical symbols.\n\nFrightening special features\n\nThe Pumpkin Biker can transform the wheels into special reels filled with precious symbols. In some cases, it can even drag a huge 3x3 wild pumpkin on the screen, which will give you terrifying winning combinations! Sometimes, the biker even removes his head, adding additional extra pumpkins on the reels, a truly horrifying scene!\n\nThe Full Moon Bonus is triggered when 3 or more haunted castle symbols appear together on the reels. Once activated, you will be asked to choose a lucky beer glass to fill in and receive a cash prize.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe magical theme with eerie sound effects gives this free slot game an original and engaging touch. There are many things to do inside the game, but if you're easily frightened, don't worry. In our library, there are less spooky video slots with adventurous themes, both in demo and real money modes.\n            ",

Are you ready to indulge in some trick or treating?\n\nEnchanting gameplay\n\nIn this free slot game, there are creatures and symbols typical of this spooky holiday such as bats, pumpkins, and black cats. The game also includes wilds, mega wilds, special reels, and multipliers that can give you numerous winnings on this haunted night. Before heading into the darkness, pay close attention to the 20 paylines to get the best winning combinations. You can modify your bet by clicking on the + and - buttons, starting from a minimum of 0.20€ to a maximum limit of 500.00€.\n\nWhich are the main symbols to keep an eye on?\n\nThe icons of Lucky Halloween\n\nIn this no-download slot, the symbols not to miss are: a witch hat, a bottle of magic potion, a blindfolded black cat, a cupcake with bat wings, a pumpkin filled with gold coins, a cauldron full of colored balls, a haunted castle, and a ghostly motorcycle from Pumpkin Biker.\n\nHow much are these icons worth?\n\nThe Pumpkin pays 400 times the bet for 5 symbols together on the reels. This icon is also the wild icon, and therefore, it substitutes other symbols to create greater winnings.\n\nThe Motorcycle is the second symbol with the best payout, paying 320 times the bet for 5 symbols.\n\nThe Witch Hat is the third symbol with the best payout, paying 160 times the bet for 5 identical icons.\n\nThe Blindfolded Black Cat pays 140 times the bet for 5 symbols.\n\nThe Bottle with Magic Potion pays up to 120 times your bet.\n\nThe Enchanted Cupcake assigns up to 100 times your bet for 5 symbols.\n\nEven the cards in this game are not to be underestimated:\n\nThe Yellow Ace rewards 80 times your bet.\n\nThe Orange King rewards up to 60 times your bet.\n\nThe Purple Queen rewards up to 40 times your bet.\n\nThe Green Jack pays up to 30 times your bet.\n\nThe Blue Jack 10 pays up to 20 times the bet for 5 identical symbols.\n\nFrightening special features\n\nThe Pumpkin Biker can transform the wheels into special reels filled with precious symbols. In some cases, it can even drag a huge 3x3 wild pumpkin on the screen, which will give you terrifying winning combinations! Sometimes, the biker even removes his head, adding additional extra pumpkins on the reels, a truly horrifying scene!\n\nThe Full Moon Bonus is triggered when 3 or more haunted castle symbols appear together on the reels. Once activated, you will be asked to choose a lucky beer glass to fill in and receive a cash prize.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe magical theme with eerie sound effects gives this free slot game an original and engaging touch. There are many things to do inside the game, but if you're easily frightened, don't worry. In our library, there are less spooky video slots with adventurous themes, both in demo and real money modes.\n            ",

Are you ready to indulge in some trick or treating?\n\nEnchanting gameplay\n\nIn this free slot game, there are creatures and symbols typical of this spooky holiday such as bats, pumpkins, and black cats. The game also includes wilds, mega wilds, special reels, and multipliers that can give you numerous winnings on this haunted night. Before heading into the darkness, pay close attention to the 20 paylines to get the best winning combinations. You can modify your bet by clicking on the + and - buttons, starting from a minimum of 0.20€ to a maximum limit of 500.00€.\n\nWhich are the main symbols to keep an eye on?\n\nThe icons of Lucky Halloween\n\nIn this no-download slot, the symbols not to miss are: a witch hat, a bottle of magic potion, a blindfolded black cat, a cupcake with bat wings, a pumpkin filled with gold coins, a cauldron full of colored balls, a haunted castle, and a ghostly motorcycle from Pumpkin Biker.\n\nHow much are these icons worth?\n\nThe Pumpkin pays 400 times the bet for 5 symbols together on the reels. This icon is also the wild icon, and therefore, it substitutes other symbols to create greater winnings.\n\nThe Motorcycle is the second symbol with the best payout, paying 320 times the bet for 5 symbols.\n\nThe Witch Hat is the third symbol with the best payout, paying 160 times the bet for 5 identical icons.\n\nThe Blindfolded Black Cat pays 140 times the bet for 5 symbols.\n\nThe Bottle with Magic Potion pays up to 120 times your bet.\n\nThe Enchanted Cupcake assigns up to 100 times your bet for 5 symbols.\n\nEven the cards in this game are not to be underestimated:\n\nThe Yellow Ace rewards 80 times your bet.\n\nThe Orange King rewards up to 60 times your bet.\n\nThe Purple Queen rewards up to 40 times your bet.\n\nThe Green Jack pays up to 30 times your bet.\n\nThe Blue Jack 10 pays up to 20 times the bet for 5 identical symbols.\n\nFrightening special features\n\nThe Pumpkin Biker can transform the wheels into special reels filled with precious symbols. In some cases, it can even drag a huge 3x3 wild pumpkin on the screen, which will give you terrifying winning combinations! Sometimes, the biker even removes his head, adding additional extra pumpkins on the reels, a truly horrifying scene!\n\nThe Full Moon Bonus is triggered when 3 or more haunted castle symbols appear together on the reels. Once activated, you will be asked to choose a lucky beer glass to fill in and receive a cash prize.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe magical theme with eerie sound effects gives this free slot game an original and engaging touch. There are many things to do inside the game, but if you're easily frightened, don't worry. In our library, there are less spooky video slots with adventurous themes, both in demo and real money modes.\n            ",
