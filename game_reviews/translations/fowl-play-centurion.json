The game featured a famous golden egg-laying hen and became so popular that its development house, WMG, has since released several variations and spin-offs, including Fowl Play Centurion, which we shall review today.\n\nFowl Play Centurion - Ave Cesare\n\nLet's begin by discussing the game's graphics: Fowl Play Centurion brings all the characters from the Fowl Play series to a Roman setting. In the game's matrix, located between two marble columns, players can find the fox, hens, and rooster, along with other elements from both Roman society and the courtyard (hay bale and gold sesterces).\n\nOnce again, WMG keeps it simple and makes it their trademark. Fowl Play Centurion is essentially the same beloved slot, dressed in a new costume to make it fresh and innovative.\n\nThe music adds an orchestral jingle to each spin, further enhancing the game's epic ambiance. But let's examine what this release offers from a technical standpoint.\n\nFowl Play Centurion - Gameplay Mechanics\n\nAs one would expect from a classic slot game like the Fowl Play series, Centurion follows the conventional playbook. It features a 5x3 game matrix, shared by most online titles, displaying fifteen symbols on each spin, divided into three on all five reels.\n\nThe RTP, or player return percentage (the percentage of money issued as winnings relative to that wagered), stands at 90%, lower than international titles but substantially higher than that of the original Fowl Play. The volatility is medium, suggesting a fair compromise between spins without winnings and winning ones, though extraordinary prizes are rarely won.\n\nTwo symbols require our attention: the White Hen, a scatter symbol that triggers the bonus mode when one appears on each reel in one spin, while the Centurion Fox is a wild symbol, meaning it is a joker that replaces all other symbols (except the Bonus) in the game.\n\nThe bonus mode has two phases: the first involves selecting between Testudo Battle and Arena of Valor modes by spinning a shield. In both modes, players must choose a random prize.\n\nSlots Similar to Fowl Play Centurion\n\nAs previously mentioned, there are several Fowl Play-themed slots, including Fowl Play Gold, 4 Fowl Play, and Fowl Play London (paying homage to Sherlock Holmes), all by WMG.",

This medium volatility game offers players a chance to win big. Keep your eyes peeled for the two special symbols, the White Hen and the Centurion Fox.

Meanwhile, the Centurion Fox is a Wild symbol that can replace all other symbols (except for the Bonus) in the game, giving you more opportunities to land winning combos.</p><p>Once you enter the bonus mode, you're in for a real feathery delight. The game is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you'll see a shield spin, which will ultimately decide between Testudo Battle and the Arena of Valor, both bonuses in which we must select a random prize.

The game grid is of the 5 * 3 type, shared by most online titles, which shows fifteen symbols on each bet divided into three on each of the five reels. The RTP is 90%, and the volatility is medium. There are two symbols that we need to pay attention to: the White Hen is a Scatter symbol that allows access to the bonus mode by finding one on each reel in a single bet, while the Centurion Fox is a Wild symbol, a joker that can replace all other symbols (except for the Bonus) in the game. The bonus mode is divided into two phases: in the first, you will see a shield spin to decide between Testudo Battle and the Arena of Valor, both bonuses in which we must select a random prize.\n\nGraphics\n\nFowl Play Centurion brings all the characters from the Fowl Play series and drops them into a Roman setting. We find the fox, the hens, the rooster, along with other elements halfway between Roman society and the courtyard (the haystack and golden sesterces), on a game grid placed between two marble columns. The WMG makes simplicity their trademark, effectively offering the same slot that we have learned to love but dressing it up in a new costume to make it fresher and more innovative. The music offers an orchestral jingle every bet, making the player's experience more epic.\n\nBonus modes\n\nFowl Play Centurion has a bonus mode that is divided into two phases: in the first, you will see a shield spin to decide between Testudo Battle and the Arena of Valor, both bonuses in which we must select a random prize. The White Hen is a Scatter symbol that allows access to the bonus mode by finding one on each reel in a single bet.\n\nRTP and volatility\n\nThe RTP of Fowl Play Centurion is 90%, which is lower than other international titles but significantly higher than the first Fowl Play. The volatility is medium, so we can expect a fair compromise between bets without a win and winning bets, although unusual prizes are rarer.\n\nWild and Scatter symbols\n\nThe Centurion Fox is a Wild symbol in Fowl Play Centurion, which is a joker that can replace all other symbols (except for the Bonus) in the game. The White Hen is a Scatter symbol that allows access to the bonus mode by finding one on each reel in a single bet.\n\n        \n            ",

The game follows the canon of the Fowl Play series, with the familiar characters and elements set in a Roman backdrop.\n\nGraphics\n\nFowl Play Centurion offers a fresh and innovative take on the classic Fowl Play series by dressing it up in a new costume. The characters and elements are set in a Roman backdrop, with a game grid placed between two marble columns. The music adds to the epic player experience with an orchestral jingle on every bet.\n\nBonus Mode\n\nFowl Play Centurion has a bonus mode that is triggered by finding a White Hen Scatter symbol on each reel in a single bet. The bonus mode is divided into two phases: Testudo Battle and the Arena of Valor, both of which offer a random prize.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nThe RTP of Fowl Play Centurion is 90%, which is lower than some international titles but higher than the first Fowl Play. The volatility is medium, offering a fair compromise between non-winning and winning bets. Unusual prizes are somewhat rare.\n\nSymbols\n\nFowl Play Centurion has two important symbols - the White Hen Scatter symbol and the Centurion Fox Wild symbol. The White Hen triggers the bonus mode, while the Centurion Fox substitutes for all other symbols (except the Bonus symbol) in the game.\n\n        \n            ",

This Italian slot machine featured the famous golden egg-laying chicken, and the title was so successful that the WMG (the developer) released several variants and spin-offs over time, including Fowl Play Centurion which we will talk about in today's review.\n\nFowl Play Centurion - Ave Cesare\nLet's start by talking about the graphics: Fowl Play Centurion brings all the characters from the Fowl Play series and drops them into a Roman setting. So, we find the fox, the hens, the rooster, along with other elements halfway between Roman society and the courtyard (the haystack and golden sesterces), on a game grid placed between two marble columns.\n\nOnce again, the WMG makes simplicity their trademark, effectively offering the same slot that we have learned to love but dressing it up in a new costume to make it fresher and more innovative. The music offers an orchestral jingle every bet, making the player's experience more epic.\n\nBut let's see what this title has to offer us from a technical point of view.\n\nFowl Play Centurion - Gameplay Mechanics\nAs we can expect from a classic slot machine like those in the Fowl Play series, Centurion follows the established canon.\n\nIn fact, we find ourselves facing a game grid of the 5 * 3 type, shared by most online titles, which shows fifteen symbols on each bet divided into three on each of the five reels.\n\nThe RTP, or player return percentage (percentage of money issued in winnings compared to that inserted as bets), is 90%, a lower value than other international titles but significantly higher than the first Fowl Play. The volatility is medium, so we can expect a fair compromise between bets without a win and winning bets, although unusual prizes are rarer.\n\nThere are two symbols that we need to pay attention to: the White Hen is a Scatter symbol that allows access to the bonus mode by finding one on each reel in a single bet, while the Centurion Fox is a Wild symbol, a joker that can replace all other symbols (except for the Bonus) in the game.\n\nThe bonus mode is divided into two phases: in the first, you will see a shield spin to decide between Testudo Battle and the Arena of Valor, both bonuses in which we must select a random prize.\n\nSimilar slots to Fowl Play Centurion\nAs we said before, Fowl Play-themed slots are different, including: Fowl Play Gold, 4 Fowl Play, and Fowl Play London (where we have a setting that pays homage to Sherlock Holmes), all from the WMG.\n            ",

This Italian slot machine featured the famous golden egg-laying chicken, and the title was so successful that the WMG (the developer) released several variants and spin-offs over time, including Fowl Play Centurion which we will talk about in today's review.\n\nFowl Play Centurion - Ave Cesare\nLet's start by talking about the graphics: Fowl Play Centurion brings all the characters from the Fowl Play series and drops them into a Roman setting. So, we find the fox, the hens, the rooster, along with other elements halfway between Roman society and the courtyard (the haystack and golden sesterces), on a game grid placed between two marble columns.\n\nOnce again, the WMG makes simplicity their trademark, effectively offering the same slot that we have learned to love but dressing it up in a new costume to make it fresher and more innovative. The music offers an orchestral jingle every bet, making the player's experience more epic.\n\nBut let's see what this title has to offer us from a technical point of view.\n\nFowl Play Centurion - Gameplay Mechanics\nAs we can expect from a classic slot machine like those in the Fowl Play series, Centurion follows the established canon.\n\nIn fact, we find ourselves facing a game grid of the 5 * 3 type, shared by most online titles, which shows fifteen symbols on each bet divided into three on each of the five reels.\n\nThe RTP, or player return percentage (percentage of money issued in winnings compared to that inserted as bets), is 90%, a lower value than other international titles but significantly higher than the first Fowl Play. The volatility is medium, so we can expect a fair compromise between bets without a win and winning bets, although unusual prizes are rarer.\n\nThere are two symbols that we need to pay attention to: the White Hen is a Scatter symbol that allows access to the bonus mode by finding one on each reel in a single bet, while the Centurion Fox is a Wild symbol, a joker that can replace all other symbols (except for the Bonus) in the game.\n\nThe bonus mode is divided into two phases: in the first, you will see a shield spin to decide between Testudo Battle and the Arena of Valor, both bonuses in which we must select a random prize.\n\nSimilar slots to Fowl Play Centurion\nAs we said before, Fowl Play-themed slots are different, including: Fowl Play Gold, 4 Fowl Play, and Fowl Play London (where we have a setting that pays homage to Sherlock Holmes), all from the WMG.\n        ",
