One of the biggest differences from the previous version is the presence of an extra payline, which increases the player's chances of getting winning combinations. There is no Wild symbol, but a Scatter symbol is present. Free spins are triggered by landing three Scatters on the reels.\n\nBetting options\n\nThe betting range in Just Jewels Deluxe is much wider than that of the previous version, starting from €0.40 and going up to a maximum of €100. This makes it a more exciting option for players who like to bet substantial sums.\n\nSymbol design\n\nAll symbols in Just Jewels Deluxe are related to the theme of wealth. Alongside the precious stones, there are symbols such as the euro logo, bundles of banknotes, gold bars, and gem-studded crowns. The symbols that pay the least are the precious stones, while the one with the highest value is the crown. The euro logo acts as a Scatter symbol and pays out regardless of its position on the reels.\n\nSimilar games\n\nThe theme of wealth is popular in the slot machine world, and other software houses offer games with similar motifs. King of Cash by Microgaming provides a gaming experience immersed in the unrestrained luxury of ancient nobility, with chests, sacks full of coins, and regal carriages. GameArt's Slot of Money is another option, where the symbols emphasize objects of extreme wealth, including champagne, luxury cars, gold watches, and magnificent yachts.\n\nPayout rate\n\nThe payout rate for Just Jewels Deluxe is 95.42%, which is within the industry standard for online slot machines. This means that players can expect to receive a fair return on their wagers over time.\n\n        \n            ",

Alongside the precious stones (amethysts, emeralds, sapphires, and rubies), we find the euro logo, bundles of banknotes, gold bars, and gem-studded crowns.\nThe symbols that pay the least are represented by the precious stones, while the one with the highest value is the crown.\nThe euro logo is the Scatter symbol in this game, and pays out regardless of its position on the reels, unlike all the other symbols, which must be strictly aligned from left to right.\nWhen the Scatter appears on the reels at least three times, free spins are automatically activated, during which winnings are multiplied.\nThe Gamble function is also an essential feature, allowing players to stake the entire prize pool and attempt to double it. If the player accepts the risk, a card is displayed on the screen, which must have its color guessed as either red or black. If the player makes the right choice, their initial win will be doubled, but if they get it wrong, they will lose the entire amount.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nThe theme of wealth, as expected, is widely developed in the realm of slot machines, with different software houses offering it in their catalogs.\nIf your dream is to feel like Scrooge McDuck in the world of slot machines, well, King of Cash might be just the thing for you, providing a gaming experience immersed in the unrestrained luxury of ancient nobility, with chests, sacks full of coins, and regal carriages!\nGameArt, on the other hand, offers Slot of Money, where the symbols are also related to the world of extreme wealth and the objects that represent it, including luxury cars, champagne, strictly gold watches, and magnificent yachts!\n        ",
