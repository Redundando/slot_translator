Simply put, it hasn't been as widely distributed as other similar titles. \n\nWhat we're facing is actually a slot machine very similar to other leading titles from this development house, which we'll briefly analyze in this review, starting with the most obvious aspect.\n\nLucky Aliens: Graphics and Sound\n\nIn Lucky Aliens by WMG, music and colors reign supreme. As for the first, we're always accompanied (both during gameplay and outside) by a very catchy music that blends very common themes with more sci-fi sounds, achieving an indisputable success. To this music must be added the sound of the reels, which perfectly matches the uniform background melody.\n\nFrom a visual point of view, on the other hand, we are faced with a very colorful and cartoonish style: on the left side is a small alien with only one eye and a jetpack. The symbols that make up the game grid range from rockets to laser guns, passing through a rich array of aliens of different shapes.\n\nThe visual department is therefore consistent and tasteful, so let's go discover the gameplay itself.\n\nLucky Aliens: Game Mechanics\n\nWe're talking about WMG, so we can assume that we'll be facing a slot machine with five reels and three horizontal lines, showing fifteen symbols on each spin.\n\nIf this is true, we must not assume that there are no novelties: the first one can be found in the paylines. Unlike the historic titles of this development house, in this case, it will be possible to decide both the value of the bet on each line and the number of paylines to play on.\n\nWe can thus switch from five lines up to a maximum of twenty, a very high number considering the standards of WMG.\n\nAmong the various symbols we should pay attention to, we find the same alien that appears on the left side of the game screen, which acts as a Wild symbol capable of replacing all others.\n\nAs for the bonus mode, this is triggered by the Scatter symbol, i.e., the spaceship. In this mode, we'll be commanding a UFO and we'll have to shoot at various spaceships. We will have a number of lives equal to the number of Scatter symbols obtained, which will come in handy for getting higher winnings.\n\nWe invite players to pay attention: each win obtained will be promoted with a large banner in the center of the screen, which will be the same whether the win is actually higher than our bet or much lower. This could give us the erroneous perception of winning when in fact our game account continues to decrease. As usual, we recommend safe and careful gambling.\n\nSlot Games Similar to Lucky Aliens\n\nThere are many slot games that exploit the theme of space and aliens. Just to name a few, we can suggest Rocket Returns by Bally, Space Adventures by Rabcat, or Cosmic Fortune by NetEnt.\n            ",

The game has five reels and three horizontal lines, showing fifteen symbols on each spin, and players can choose to bet from five up to a maximum of twenty paylines.\n\nGameplay Features\n\nThe game features a catchy music that blends very common themes with more sci-fi sounds, which perfectly matches the uniform background melody. Lucky Aliens has a Wild symbol which is the one-eyed alien that appears on the left side of the game screen, capable of replacing all others. The bonus mode, on the other hand, is triggered by the Scatter symbol, the spaceship, which takes players to a mode where they command a UFO and shoot at various spaceships. The number of lives is equal to the number of Scatter symbols obtained, which helps in getting higher winnings. Additionally, each win obtained is promoted with a large banner in the center of the screen.\n\nPaylines and Betting Options\n\nUnlike the historic titles of WMG, in Lucky Aliens, players are given the opportunity to decide both the value of the bet on each line and the number of paylines to play on. The paylines can range from five up to a maximum of twenty, which is a very high number compared to the standards of WMG.\n\nWild Symbol\n\nThe Wild symbol of Lucky Aliens is the one-eyed alien that appears on the left side of the game screen.

Simply put, it hasn't been as widely distributed as other similar titles. \n\nWhat we're facing is actually a slot machine very similar to other leading titles from this development house, which we'll briefly analyze in this review, starting with the most obvious aspect.\n\nLucky Aliens: Graphics and Sound\n\nIn Lucky Aliens by WMG, music and colors reign supreme. As for the first, we're always accompanied (both during gameplay and outside) by a very catchy music that blends very common themes with more sci-fi sounds, achieving an indisputable success. To this music must be added the sound of the reels, which perfectly matches the uniform background melody.\n\nFrom a visual point of view, on the other hand, we are faced with a very colorful and cartoonish style: on the left side is a small alien with only one eye and a jetpack. The symbols that make up the game grid range from rockets to laser guns, passing through a rich array of aliens of different shapes.\n\nThe visual department is therefore consistent and tasteful, so let's go discover the gameplay itself.\n\nLucky Aliens: Game Mechanics\n\nWe're talking about WMG, so we can assume that we'll be facing a slot machine with five reels and three horizontal lines, showing fifteen symbols on each spin.\n\nIf this is true, we must not assume that there are no novelties: the first one can be found in the paylines. Unlike the historic titles of this development house, in this case, it will be possible to decide both the value of the bet on each line and the number of paylines to play on.\n\nWe can thus switch from five lines up to a maximum of twenty, a very high number considering the standards of WMG.\n\nAmong the various symbols we should pay attention to, we find the same alien that appears on the left side of the game screen, which acts as a Wild symbol capable of replacing all others.\n\nAs for the bonus mode, this is triggered by the Scatter symbol, i.e., the spaceship. In this mode, we'll be commanding a UFO and we'll have to shoot at various spaceships. We will have a number of lives equal to the number of Scatter symbols obtained, which will come in handy for getting higher winnings.\n\nWe invite players to pay attention: each win obtained will be promoted with a large banner in the center of the screen, which will be the same whether the win is actually higher than our bet or much lower. This could give us the erroneous perception of winning when in fact our game account continues to decrease. As usual, we recommend safe and careful gambling.\n\nSlot Games Similar to Lucky Aliens\n\nThere are many slot games that exploit the theme of space and aliens. Just to name a few, we can suggest Rocket Returns by Bally, Space Adventures by Rabcat, or Cosmic Fortune by NetEnt.\n            ",
