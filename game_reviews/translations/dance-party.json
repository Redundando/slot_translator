La slot machine online, infatti, ha ereditato le funzionalità di un’altra macchinetta più datata che è la Extra Juicy. Ovviamente però il team di Pragmatic Play ha pensato di reinventarla per creare qualcosa di diverso. Prima di tutto con il suo tema: il look è tipico di una discoteca moderna, ma la struttura è comunque in vecchio stile. Il suo aspetto resta piacevole ma in qualche modo non è il suo punto di forza, anche se si presenta in modo funzionale. Di seguito scopriremo quali sono le sue caratteristiche, i bonus che offre e le funzionalità che lasciano il segno!\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nHa una struttura standard con un formato 3×5 che sarà sufficiente per aiutare il giocatore a scatenarsi su una dancefloor, tra luci al neon e un’atmosfera che coinvolge. L’intenzione di Dance Party è di presentarsi sul mercato come una slot che è energica, ricca di divertimento per non risultare un prodotto di nicchia, ma capace di attirare chiunque. A livello di animazioni è abbastanza statica, ma è vero che si percepisce una bella energia non solo per musica, ma anche per la fluidità del gioco. Il gameplay è in crescere e raggiunge massimo divertimento quando si attiva la modalità Free Spin. Prevede 243 modi per vincere mentre ti lasci coccolare dalla musicalità tipica di una serata in disco con gli amici.\nIl simbolo più importante, oltre alle icone classiche delle carte, è lo Scatter che è il diamante, e per ogni suo atterraggio sul tabellone di gioco viene accompagnato da un cambio musica. Se ne riesci a trovare 5 si attiva il bonus giri gratuiti con moltiplicatore progressivo. Per ogni giro il moltiplicatore aumenta fino a un massimo di 30x. Considera che se dovessero presentarsi altri 5 Scatter potrai collezionare altri 15 giri aggiuntivi fino a un massimo di 50.\nIl giocatore potrà decidere l’ammontare della sua scommessa, attribuendo un valore da 1 a 10, che prevede l’uso di 0,01-0,50 cent fino a un massimo di 100€ per giro. Le vincite si ottengono quando riesci a collezionare almeno 3 simboli uguali da sinistra a destra. Tra gli altri simboli troviamo il premium BAR, il doppio BAR, il triplo 7 e il DJ illuminato con luce neon. Quest’ultimo è da tenere sott’occhio perché assegna una vittoria pare a 7,5 volte la scommessa. Infine per cercare di aumentare la percentuale di vincita bisogna affidarsi al simbolo Wild, che è il logo del gioco e appare sui rulli 2, 3, 4 e 5.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Dance Party\nDa questa operazione che sembrava a tutti gli effetti un ringiovanimento di un titolo già visto sulla software house è uscito qualcosa di positivo. E’ stato esaltato un buon potenziale base dal quale partire per trasformare la slot machine online Dance Party in qualcosa di positivo. Più giri gratuiti ottieni e più si moltiplica velocemente la tua vincita. Non male anche il suo livello di RTP che arriva a quota 96.50%.\n",

However, the online slot machine has inherited the features of an older machine, Extra Juicy. Of course, the team at Pragmatic Play has thought of reinventing it to create something different. Firstly, with its theme: the look is typical of a modern disco, but the structure is still old school. Its appearance remains pleasant but not its strong point, although it presents itself in a functional way. Here are its features, bonuses and features that leave their mark!\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nIt has a standard structure with a 3x5 format that will be sufficient to help the player let loose on a dancefloor, amidst neon lights and an immersive atmosphere. Dance Party's intention is to present itself on the market as an energetic slot machine, rich in fun, not to be a niche product, but capable of attracting anyone. In terms of animations, it is quite static, but it is true that you can feel a beautiful energy not only for music but also for the fluidity of the game. The gameplay is growing and reaching maximum fun when the Free Spin mode is activated. It provides 243 ways to win while enjoying the typical musicality of a night out dancing with friends.\n\nThe most important symbol, in addition to the classic card icons, is the Scatter symbol which is the diamond, and for each of its landings on the game board, a change of music accompanies it. If you manage to find 5, the free spins bonus with a progressive multiplier is activated. For each spin, the multiplier increases up to a maximum of 30x. Keep in mind that if another 5 Scatter symbols appear, you can collect another 15 additional spins up to a maximum of 50.\n\nThe player can decide the amount of their bet, assigning a value from 1 to 10, which uses 0.01-0.50 cents up to a maximum of €100 per spin. Wins are obtained when you manage to collect at least 3 identical symbols from left to right. Among the other symbols, we find the premium BAR, double BAR, triple 7 and the neon-lit DJ. The latter is to be kept under control because it assigns a victory equal to 7.5 times the bet. Finally, to try to increase the percentage of winnings, you have to rely on the Wild symbol, which is the game logo and appears on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5.\n\nFinal considerations on Dance Party slot machine\nFrom this operation that seemed like a rejuvenation of a title already seen on the software house, something positive has come out. A good base potential has been highlighted from which to start the transformation of the online slot machine Dance Party into something positive. The more free spins you get, the faster your winnings multiply. Not bad is its level of RTP that reaches 96.50%. Experienced gamblers will appreciate the potential for big wins and the smooth gaming experience.\n            ",

However, the online slot machine has inherited the features of an older machine, Extra Juicy. Of course, the team at Pragmatic Play has thought of reinventing it to create something different. Firstly, with its theme: the look is typical of a modern disco, but the structure is still old school. Its appearance remains pleasant but not its strong point, although it presents itself in a functional way. Here are its features, bonuses and features that leave their mark!\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nIt has a standard structure with a 3x5 format that will be sufficient to help the player let loose on a dancefloor, amidst neon lights and an immersive atmosphere. Dance Party's intention is to present itself on the market as an energetic slot machine, rich in fun, not to be a niche product, but capable of attracting anyone. In terms of animations, it is quite static, but it is true that you can feel a beautiful energy not only for music but also for the fluidity of the game. The gameplay is growing and reaching maximum fun when the Free Spin mode is activated. It provides 243 ways to win while enjoying the typical musicality of a night out dancing with friends.\n\nThe most important symbol, in addition to the classic card icons, is the Scatter symbol which is the diamond, and for each of its landings on the game board, a change of music accompanies it. If you manage to find 5, the free spins bonus with a progressive multiplier is activated. For each spin, the multiplier increases up to a maximum of 30x. Keep in mind that if another 5 Scatter symbols appear, you can collect another 15 additional spins up to a maximum of 50.\n\nThe player can decide the amount of their bet, assigning a value from 1 to 10, which uses 0.01-0.50 cents up to a maximum of €100 per spin. Wins are obtained when you manage to collect at least 3 identical symbols from left to right. Among the other symbols, we find the premium BAR, double BAR, triple 7 and the neon-lit DJ. The latter is to be kept under control because it assigns a victory equal to 7.5 times the bet. Finally, to try to increase the percentage of winnings, you have to rely on the Wild symbol, which is the game logo and appears on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5.\n\nFinal considerations on Dance Party slot machine\nFrom this operation that seemed like a rejuvenation of a title already seen on the software house, something positive has come out. A good base potential has been highlighted from which to start the transformation of the online slot machine Dance Party into something positive. The more free spins you get, the faster your winnings multiply. Not bad is its level of RTP that reaches 96.50%. Experienced gamblers will appreciate the potential for big wins and the smooth gaming experience.\n        ",
