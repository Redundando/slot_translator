Not the dragon with its treasure trove, not the phoenix symbolizing rebirth, and not even the unicorn symbolizing luck... the chicken.\nIn bars all over Italy in the early 2000s, you could always find the same slot machine with chickens, and this animal (which is also part of rural daily life) has remained in our hearts. Capecod, aware of the Italian tradition, offers the title Chicken Hatch, where we can hunt for the golden egg-laying chicken and bring home a decent sum.\nLet’s see what this slot has to offer.\nChicken Hatch: Visual Analysis\nFrom a purely visual and musical standpoint, the Chicken Hatch slot proves to be simple but tasteful: the symbols that make up the game grid reference the typical farming reality of a farm. We find chicks, hens, and roosters, but also carts, vegetables, and the fearsome wolf.\nOne aspect that catches the attention is the attention to detail: as in other online slots, in this case, among the various symbols we find those of playing cards (A, K, Q...) but, in order not to stray too far from the theme, these symbols are shown in an extremely particular way.\nHere the ace becomes two cobs touching each other at the top or the jack becomes an oddly shaped eggplant. A small detail much appreciated by those who value the visual aspect of a slot machine.\nChicken Hatch: How to Play\nAt the start of the game, the player is given a choice of what they want to collect. On one side, we find ten eggs, on the other hand, five hens. Whatever our choice, completing the selected counter will allow us to access the final bonus, a difficult but not impossible challenge.\nFocusing instead on the more basic aspects of this title, what we find in front of us is a slot that uses the 5*3 mechanism (like most Capecod games) and presents twenty paylines.\nGiven the possibility of obtaining the cumulative bonus, it is not surprising that numerous special symbols are found within the game grid. Let's start with the eggs and the white hen: these special symbols allow you to increase the counter, but this will only happen by finding at least three in a single play. We are therefore talking about Scatter symbols, just like the basket of eggs that allows us to access the free spins.\nAnother special symbol is the scarecrow: not only is this a Wild symbol, that is, a joker that can replace all others to give interesting combinations, but it can also extend across the entire reel.\nBased on our experience, the bonus mode triggered by finding the eggs or hens is definitely interesting (in which five attempts are granted that can give us random bonuses) but finding these symbols is very difficult (in our first attempt, we got one out of ten in about fifty spins of the slot). However, it is worth noting that the winnings during these spins were not rare, which made our search for the final bonus less tedious.\nSlots similar to Chicken Hatch\nTalking about chickens and golden eggs, we cannot fail to mention the famous Fowl Play Gold by Merkur or Golden Egg of Crazy Chicken by Gamomat (the latter offers the same theme in a slightly alternative way).\n            ",

The game is developed by Capecod Gaming, and it offers an interesting twist to the conventional online slot game.\n\nGameplay Features\n\nChicken Hatch is a 5-reel, 3-row online slot game that comes with 20 paylines. The game features symbols that are inspired by rural life, such as hens, chicks, roosters, carts, vegetables, and the fearsome wolf. The symbols of playing cards, A, K, Q, are also part of the game, but they are shown in a unique way to stick to the theme of farming.\n\nBonus Modes\n\nChicken Hatch offers various special symbols that increase the player's chances of winning. The eggs and the white hen are scatter symbols that give the player an opportunity to increase the counter. The basket of eggs is another symbol that grants free spins if the player gets a minimum of three in a single play. The scarecrow symbol is a wild symbol that can replace others to give the player better combinations and extends across the entire reel. The game also involves a final bonus, where the player has to collect either ten eggs or five hens to access the final bonus – a challenging but not impossible task. During this bonus mode, the player has five attempts that could grant them random bonuses. However, these symbols are not easy to come by, and the bonus mode is difficult to trigger.\n\nVisual Analysis\n\nThe visuals of Chicken Hatch are simple but tasteful. The symbols used in the game grid brilliantly reference the farming reality of a farm, and great attention to detail is evident in the visuals. The game also features a great soundtrack that adds a pleasant ambiance to the game.\n\nSimilar Slots to Chicken Hatch\n\nIf you enjoyed Chicken Hatch, you might also like Fowl Play Gold by Merkur or Golden Egg of Crazy Chicken by Gamomat. Both slots feature a familiar theme of golden eggs and chickens with an alternative twist to the gameplay.\n\n        \n            ",

Not the dragon with its treasure trove, not the phoenix symbolizing rebirth, and not even the unicorn symbolizing luck... the chicken.\nIn bars all over Italy in the early 2000s, you could always find the same slot machine with chickens, and this animal (which is also part of rural daily life) has remained in our hearts. Capecod, aware of the Italian tradition, offers the title Chicken Hatch, where we can hunt for the golden egg-laying chicken and bring home a decent sum.\nLet’s see what this slot has to offer.\nChicken Hatch: Visual Analysis\nFrom a purely visual and musical standpoint, the Chicken Hatch slot proves to be simple but tasteful: the symbols that make up the game grid reference the typical farming reality of a farm. We find chicks, hens, and roosters, but also carts, vegetables, and the fearsome wolf.\nOne aspect that catches the attention is the attention to detail: as in other online slots, in this case, among the various symbols we find those of playing cards (A, K, Q...) but, in order not to stray too far from the theme, these symbols are shown in an extremely particular way.\nHere the ace becomes two cobs touching each other at the top or the jack becomes an oddly shaped eggplant. A small detail much appreciated by those who value the visual aspect of a slot machine.\nChicken Hatch: How to Play\nAt the start of the game, the player is given a choice of what they want to collect. On one side, we find ten eggs, on the other hand, five hens. Whatever our choice, completing the selected counter will allow us to access the final bonus, a difficult but not impossible challenge.\nFocusing instead on the more basic aspects of this title, what we find in front of us is a slot that uses the 5*3 mechanism (like most Capecod games) and presents twenty paylines.\nGiven the possibility of obtaining the cumulative bonus, it is not surprising that numerous special symbols are found within the game grid. Let's start with the eggs and the white hen: these special symbols allow you to increase the counter, but this will only happen by finding at least three in a single play. We are therefore talking about Scatter symbols, just like the basket of eggs that allows us to access the free spins.\nAnother special symbol is the scarecrow: not only is this a Wild symbol, that is, a joker that can replace all others to give interesting combinations, but it can also extend across the entire reel.\nBased on our experience, the bonus mode triggered by finding the eggs or hens is definitely interesting (in which five attempts are granted that can give us random bonuses) but finding these symbols is very difficult (in our first attempt, we got one out of ten in about fifty spins of the slot). However, it is worth noting that the winnings during these spins were not rare, which made our search for the final bonus less tedious.\nSlots similar to Chicken Hatch\nTalking about chickens and golden eggs, we cannot fail to mention the famous Fowl Play Gold by Merkur or Golden Egg of Crazy Chicken by Gamomat (the latter offers the same theme in a slightly alternative way).\n            ",

Whatever our choice, completing the selected counter will allow us to access the final bonus, a difficult but not impossible challenge.\nFocusing instead on the more basic aspects of this title, what we find in front of us is a slot that uses the 5*3 mechanism (like most Capecod games) and presents twenty paylines.\nGiven the possibility of obtaining the cumulative bonus, it is not surprising that numerous special symbols are found within the game grid. Let's start with the eggs and the white hen: these special symbols allow you to increase the counter, but this will only happen by finding at least three in a single play. We are therefore talking about Scatter symbols, just like the basket of eggs that allows us to access the free spins.\nAnother special symbol is the scarecrow: not only is this a Wild symbol, that is, a joker that can replace all others to give interesting combinations, but it can also extend across the entire reel.\nBased on our experience, the bonus mode triggered by finding the eggs or hens is definitely interesting (in which five attempts are granted that can give us random bonuses) but finding these symbols is very difficult (in our first attempt, we got one out of ten in about fifty spins of the slot). However, it is worth noting that the winnings during these spins were not rare, which made our search for the final bonus less tedious.\nSlots similar to Chicken Hatch\nTalking about chickens and golden eggs, we cannot fail to mention the famous Fowl Play Gold by Merkur or Golden Egg of Crazy Chicken by Gamomat (the latter offers the same theme in a slightly alternative way).\n            ",

Not the dragon with its treasure trove, not the phoenix symbolizing rebirth, and not even the unicorn symbolizing luck... the chicken.\nIn bars all over Italy in the early 2000s, you could always find the same slot machine with chickens, and this animal (which is also part of rural daily life) has remained in our hearts. Capecod, aware of the Italian tradition, offers the title Chicken Hatch, where we can hunt for the golden egg-laying chicken and bring home a decent sum.\nLet’s see what this slot has to offer.\nChicken Hatch: Visual Analysis\nFrom a purely visual and musical standpoint, the Chicken Hatch slot proves to be simple but tasteful: the symbols that make up the game grid reference the typical farming reality of a farm. We find chicks, hens, and roosters, but also carts, vegetables, and the fearsome wolf.\nOne aspect that catches the attention is the attention to detail: as in other online slots, in this case, among the various symbols we find those of playing cards (A, K, Q...) but, in order not to stray too far from the theme, these symbols are shown in an extremely particular way.\nHere the ace becomes two cobs touching each other at the top or the jack becomes an oddly shaped eggplant. A small detail much appreciated by those who value the visual aspect of a slot machine.\nChicken Hatch: How to Play\nAt the start of the game, the player is given a choice of what they want to collect. On one side, we find ten eggs, on the other hand, five hens. Whatever our choice, completing the selected counter will allow us to access the final bonus, a difficult but not impossible challenge.\nFocusing instead on the more basic aspects of this title, what we find in front of us is a slot that uses the 5*3 mechanism (like most Capecod games) and presents twenty paylines.\nGiven the possibility of obtaining the cumulative bonus, it is not surprising that numerous special symbols are found within the game grid.
