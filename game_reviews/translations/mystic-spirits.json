Red Rake Gaming celebrates the culture, religion, and sense of freedom that has always accompanied the Native American people with Mystic Spirits. The game's protagonist is a shaman with dual power: he can evoke the spirit of the wolf and also win us stunning rewards!\n\nLet's focus for a moment on the graphics because Red Rare Gaming has done an excellent job on this component. The starry sky illuminates a valley intersected by a crystal clear river and surrounded by tall trees. Two large totems illuminated in purple oversee the game board, enclosed in a wooden frame with a texture that seems to be made of hard leather. The dark color of the texture contrasts with the bright three-dimensional symbols, creating a visually stunning effect.\n\nThe buttons are carved into the wood and located at the bottom of the screen, accompanied by typical Native American music played on flutes and sounds of nature.\n\nMystic Spirits features a classic layout with 5 reels and 4 rows and boasts an impressive 50 paylines. The minimum bet to play is only €0.20, which can be raised up to a maximum of €50.\n\nTo win, you need to match 3 to 5 identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right. The maximum payout is 750 times your bet. By clicking on the second-last button on the right, you can access the Autoplay function to set up 5 to 100 automatic spins. The game's volatility is average, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95%.\n\nMystic Spirits offers 4 low-paying symbols and 5 high-paying symbols, plus 3 special symbols. The low-paying symbols are the playing cards from J to Ace, while the more generous ones include symbols such as the drum, the pipe, the axe, the camp, and the valley. The Wild symbol is a Joker that replaces all icons except the Wolf symbol, which is the Scatter. With the Wolf symbol, you can win from a minimum of 10 Free Spins up to a maximum of 50. But that's not all, as each Scatter can appear with a number indicating additional free spins to add to those already won. The maximum number of Free Spins achievable is 300! The final special symbol is the shaman: landing 3, 4, or 5 of them earns you a win equal to 40, 150, or 750 times your bet!\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the maximum win with a single spin in the base game?\n\nThe potential win is 750 times the initial bet.\n\nHow many Free Spins can you win?\n\nIn Mystic Spirits, you can get from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 300 free spins.\n\nHow many paylines does Mystic Spirits have?\n\nThis game features 50 fixed paylines. \n\nPlay Mystic Spirits now and let the spirits guide you to great rewards!\n            ",

The Wild symbol is a Joker that replaces all icons except the Wolf symbol, which is the Scatter.

Red Rake Gaming celebrates the culture, religion, and sense of freedom that has always accompanied the Native American people with Mystic Spirits. The game's protagonist is a shaman with dual power: he can evoke the spirit of the wolf and also win us stunning rewards!\n\nLet's focus for a moment on the graphics because Red Rare Gaming has done an excellent job on this component. The starry sky illuminates a valley intersected by a crystal clear river and surrounded by tall trees. Two large totems illuminated in purple oversee the game board, enclosed in a wooden frame with a texture that seems to be made of hard leather. The dark color of the texture contrasts with the bright three-dimensional symbols, creating a visually stunning effect.\n\nThe buttons are carved into the wood and located at the bottom of the screen, accompanied by typical Native American music played on flutes and sounds of nature.\n\nMystic Spirits features a classic layout with 5 reels and 4 rows and boasts an impressive 50 paylines. The minimum bet to play is only €0.20, which can be raised up to a maximum of €50.\n\nTo win, you need to match 3 to 5 identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right. The maximum payout is 750 times your bet. By clicking on the second-last button on the right, you can access the Autoplay function to set up 5 to 100 automatic spins. The game's volatility is average, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95%.\n\nMystic Spirits offers 4 low-paying symbols and 5 high-paying symbols, plus 3 special symbols. The low-paying symbols are the playing cards from J to Ace, while the more generous ones include symbols such as the drum, the pipe, the axe, the camp, and the valley. The Wild symbol is a Joker that replaces all icons except the Wolf symbol, which is the Scatter. With the Wolf symbol, you can win from a minimum of 10 Free Spins up to a maximum of 50. But that's not all, as each Scatter can appear with a number indicating additional free spins to add to those already won. The maximum number of Free Spins achievable is 300! The final special symbol is the shaman: landing 3, 4, or 5 of them earns you a win equal to 40, 150, or 750 times your bet!\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the maximum win with a single spin in the base game?\n\nThe potential win is 750 times the initial bet.\n\nHow many Free Spins can you win?\n\nIn Mystic Spirits, you can get from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 300 free spins.\n\nHow many paylines does Mystic Spirits have?\n\nThis game features 50 fixed paylines. \n\nPlay Mystic Spirits now and let the spirits guide you to great rewards!\n            ",
