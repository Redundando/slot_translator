After all, Pragmatic Play is a heavyweight in the world of online gaming, a success story that has been declared by millions of players worldwide.\nOne of the strengths of Gods of Giza is undoubtedly the graphics. In the base game, we find ourselves on a terrace of the royal palace, from where we can admire the palm trees and what appears to be the king's garden. When we play with the Free Spins, on the other hand, the game background is a room full of gold and jewels. The symbols are very large, with excellent definition and color tones that accentuate their three-dimensionality.\nSpecial mention goes to the music that accompanies the game, an oriental melody that immerses us even more in the atmosphere of the slot.\nSlot features\nThe game system is a cascade, which means that after every paying combo, the winning symbols are replaced by new ones with which further lucky series can be created.\nThe grid is square, with 5 reels and 5 rows on which 10 fixed paylines are housed. There are different betting levels, with a Spin cost of at least €0.20. The maximum cost is €100, and the highest payout is 5,000 times the bet.\nAutomatic spins, fast spin, and Turbo accelerate the gameplay.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.01%, while the volatility is high.\nHow to play Gods of Giza\nOne peculiar feature of this game is that there are only 6 basic symbols. The first three, those with the lowest value, are represented by blue, green, and pink gemstones. In the second group, we find the Eye of Ra, the jackal, and the eagle.\nIf in the vast majority of slots the Wild appears randomly, here it is added every time a winning combo is obtained, it will remain glued during the Respins for three times, then it will explode together with the other symbols. Besides, it can appear accompanied by a random multiplier between x2 and x10. Naturally, the Wild replaces all symbols except the Scatter and pays more than all the other icons.\nThe other special symbol is the Scatter: when 3 land in the same Spin, you are rewarded with 10 Free Spins. In case of at least 3 more Scatter land, 5 additional free spins are added. During the Bonus game, at least one Wild is guaranteed on every spin, and if it disappears after 3 winning combinations in the base game, here it remains for 5 Spins.\n\nFAQ\nHow can I use the Free Spins?\nThere are two ways: the first is that at least 3 Scatters land on the reels, the second is to buy the feature by clicking on the Buy Free Spins box at a cost of 100 times the bet.\n\nCan I play Gods of Giza on a tablet?\nYes, this slot is built in HTML5, so it works on every mobile device, as well as on the computer.\n\nWhat volatility does Gods of Giza have?\nThe volatility is high, it is not easy to win, but you could be rewarded with substantial prizes!",

During the Bonus game, at least one Wild is guaranteed on every spin, and if it disappears after 3 winning combinations in the base game, here it remains for 5 Spins.\n\nFAQ\nHow can I use the Free Spins?\nThere are two ways: the first is that at least 3 Scatters land on the reels, the second is to buy the feature by clicking on the Buy Free Spins box at a cost of 100 times the bet.\n\nCan I play Gods of Giza on a tablet?\nYes, this slot is built in HTML5, so it works on every mobile device, as well as on the computer.\n\nWhat volatility does Gods of Giza have?\nThe volatility is high, it is not easy to win, but you could be rewarded with substantial prizes!\n        ",

After all, Pragmatic Play is a heavyweight in the world of online gaming, a success story that has been declared by millions of players worldwide.\nOne of the strengths of Gods of Giza is undoubtedly the graphics. In the base game, we find ourselves on a terrace of the royal palace, from where we can admire the palm trees and what appears to be the king's garden. When we play with the Free Spins, on the other hand, the game background is a room full of gold and jewels. The symbols are very large, with excellent definition and color tones that accentuate their three-dimensionality.\nSpecial mention goes to the music that accompanies the game, an oriental melody that immerses us even more in the atmosphere of the slot.\nSlot features\nThe game system is a cascade, which means that after every paying combo, the winning symbols are replaced by new ones with which further lucky series can be created.\nThe grid is square, with 5 reels and 5 rows on which 10 fixed paylines are housed. There are different betting levels, with a Spin cost of at least €0.20. The maximum cost is €100, and the highest payout is 5,000 times the bet.\nAutomatic spins, fast spin, and Turbo accelerate the gameplay.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.01%, while the volatility is high.\nHow to play Gods of Giza\nOne peculiar feature of this game is that there are only 6 basic symbols. The first three, those with the lowest value, are represented by blue, green, and pink gemstones. In the second group, we find the Eye of Ra, the jackal, and the eagle.\nIf in the vast majority of slots the Wild appears randomly, here it is added every time a winning combo is obtained, it will remain glued during the Respins for three times, then it will explode together with the other symbols. Besides, it can appear accompanied by a random multiplier between x2 and x10. Naturally, the Wild replaces all symbols except the Scatter and pays more than all the other icons.\nThe other special symbol is the Scatter: when 3 land in the same Spin, you are rewarded with 10 Free Spins. In case of at least 3 more Scatter land, 5 additional free spins are added.

The symbols are very large, with excellent definition and color tones that accentuate their three-dimensionality.\nSpecial mention goes to the music that accompanies the game, an oriental melody that immerses us even more in the atmosphere of the slot.\nSlot features\nThe game system is a cascade, which means that after every paying combo, the winning symbols are replaced by new ones with which further lucky series can be created.\nThe grid is square, with 5 reels and 5 rows on which 10 fixed paylines are housed. There are different betting levels, with a Spin cost of at least €0.20. The maximum cost is €100, and the highest payout is 5,000 times the bet.\nAutomatic spins, fast spin, and Turbo accelerate the gameplay.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.01%, while the volatility is high.\nHow to play Gods of Giza\nOne peculiar feature of this game is that there are only 6 basic symbols. The first three, those with the lowest value, are represented by blue, green, and pink gemstones. In the second group, we find the Eye of Ra, the jackal, and the eagle.\nIf in the vast majority of slots the Wild appears randomly, here it is added every time a winning combo is obtained, it will remain glued during the Respins for three times, then it will explode together with the other symbols. Besides, it can appear accompanied by a random multiplier between x2 and x10. Naturally, the Wild replaces all symbols except the Scatter and pays more than all the other icons.\nThe other special symbol is the Scatter: when 3 land in the same Spin, you are rewarded with 10 Free Spins. In case of at least 3 more Scatter land, 5 additional free spins are added. During the Bonus game, at least one Wild is guaranteed on every spin, and if it disappears after 3 winning combinations in the base game, here it remains for 5 Spins.\n\nFAQ\nHow can I use the Free Spins?\nThere are two ways: the first is that at least 3 Scatters land on the reels, the second is to buy the feature by clicking on the Buy Free Spins box at a cost of 100 times the bet.\n\nCan I play Gods of Giza on a tablet?\nYes, this slot is built in HTML5, so it works on every mobile device, as well as on the computer.\n\nWhat volatility does Gods of Giza have?\nThe volatility is high, it is not easy to win, but you could be rewarded with substantial prizes!\n            ",

The game grid is square with 5 reels and 5 rows on which 10 fixed paylines are housed. The game system is a cascade. After every paying combo, the winning symbols are replaced by new ones with which further lucky series can be created. There are different betting levels, with a Spin cost of at least €0.20 and a maximum cost of €100. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.01%, while the volatility is high. Automatic spins, fast spin, and Turbo accelerate the gameplay.\n\nGraphics and Sound Effects\n\nGods of Giza boasts quality graphics that make it stand out among other slot games set in Ancient Egypt. The symbols are large with excellent definition and accentuated three-dimensionality. In the base game, the setting is a terrace of the royal palace, while in the Free Spins game, the background is a room full of gold and jewels. The music that accompanies the game is an engaging oriental melody that immerses the player even more in the atmosphere of the slot.\n\nPaylines and Reels\n\nGods of Giza has a square grid with 5 reels and 5 rows on which 10 fixed paylines are housed.\n\nBonus Features\n\nGods of Giza features Wild multipliers and a special Scatter. The Wild replaces all symbols except the Scatter and can appear accompanied by a random multiplier between x2 and x10. Every time a winning combo is obtained, the Wild will remain glued during the Respins for three times, then it will explode together with the other symbols. The Scatter, on the other hand, rewards the player with 10 Free Spins when at least 3 appear on the reels in the same Spin. During the Bonus game, at least one Wild is guaranteed on every spin, and if it disappears after 3 winning combinations in the base game, here, it remains for 5 Spins. There is also an option to buy the Free Spins feature by clicking on the Buy Free Spins box at a cost of 100 times the bet.\n\nVolatility and Payout\n\nGods of Giza has a high volatility, which means it is not easy to win, but players can be rewarded with substantial prizes. The highest payout in the game is 5,000 times the bet.\n\n        \n            ",

After all, Pragmatic Play is a heavyweight in the world of online gaming, a success story that has been declared by millions of players worldwide.\nOne of the strengths of Gods of Giza is undoubtedly the graphics. In the base game, we find ourselves on a terrace of the royal palace, from where we can admire the palm trees and what appears to be the king's garden. When we play with the Free Spins, on the other hand, the game background is a room full of gold and jewels. The symbols are very large, with excellent definition and color tones that accentuate their three-dimensionality.\nSpecial mention goes to the music that accompanies the game, an oriental melody that immerses us even more in the atmosphere of the slot.\nSlot features\nThe game system is a cascade, which means that after every paying combo, the winning symbols are replaced by new ones with which further lucky series can be created.\nThe grid is square, with 5 reels and 5 rows on which 10 fixed paylines are housed. There are different betting levels, with a Spin cost of at least €0.20. The maximum cost is €100, and the highest payout is 5,000 times the bet.\nAutomatic spins, fast spin, and Turbo accelerate the gameplay.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.01%, while the volatility is high.\nHow to play Gods of Giza\nOne peculiar feature of this game is that there are only 6 basic symbols. The first three, those with the lowest value, are represented by blue, green, and pink gemstones. In the second group, we find the Eye of Ra, the jackal, and the eagle.\nIf in the vast majority of slots the Wild appears randomly, here it is added every time a winning combo is obtained, it will remain glued during the Respins for three times, then it will explode together with the other symbols. Besides, it can appear accompanied by a random multiplier between x2 and x10. Naturally, the Wild replaces all symbols except the Scatter and pays more than all the other icons.\nThe other special symbol is the Scatter: when 3 land in the same Spin, you are rewarded with 10 Free Spins. In case of at least 3 more Scatter land, 5 additional free spins are added. During the Bonus game, at least one Wild is guaranteed on every spin, and if it disappears after 3 winning combinations in the base game, here it remains for 5 Spins.\n\nFAQ\nHow can I use the Free Spins?\nThere are two ways: the first is that at least 3 Scatters land on the reels, the second is to buy the feature by clicking on the Buy Free Spins box at a cost of 100 times the bet.\n\nCan I play Gods of Giza on a tablet?\nYes, this slot is built in HTML5, so it works on every mobile device, as well as on the computer.\n\nWhat volatility does Gods of Giza have?\nThe volatility is high, it is not easy to win, but you could be rewarded with substantial prizes!\n            ",

After all, Pragmatic Play is a heavyweight in the world of online gaming, a success story that has been declared by millions of players worldwide.\nOne of the strengths of Gods of Giza is undoubtedly the graphics. In the base game, we find ourselves on a terrace of the royal palace, from where we can admire the palm trees and what appears to be the king's garden. When we play with the Free Spins, on the other hand, the game background is a room full of gold and jewels. The symbols are very large, with excellent definition and color tones that accentuate their three-dimensionality.\nSpecial mention goes to the music that accompanies the game, an oriental melody that immerses us even more in the atmosphere of the slot.\nSlot features\nThe game system is a cascade, which means that after every paying combo, the winning symbols are replaced by new ones with which further lucky series can be created.\nThe grid is square, with 5 reels and 5 rows on which 10 fixed paylines are housed. There are different betting levels, with a Spin cost of at least €0.20. The maximum cost is €100, and the highest payout is 5,000 times the bet.\nAutomatic spins, fast spin, and Turbo accelerate the gameplay.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.01%, while the volatility is high.\nHow to play Gods of Giza\nOne peculiar feature of this game is that there are only 6 basic symbols. The first three, those with the lowest value, are represented by blue, green, and pink gemstones. In the second group, we find the Eye of Ra, the jackal, and the eagle.\nIf in the vast majority of slots the Wild appears randomly, here it is added every time a winning combo is obtained, it will remain glued during the Respins for three times, then it will explode together with the other symbols. Besides, it can appear accompanied by a random multiplier between x2 and x10. Naturally, the Wild replaces all symbols except the Scatter and pays more than all the other icons.\nThe other special symbol is the Scatter: when 3 land in the same Spin, you are rewarded with 10 Free Spins. In case of at least 3 more Scatter land, 5 additional free spins are added. During the Bonus game, at least one Wild is guaranteed on every spin, and if it disappears after 3 winning combinations in the base game, here it remains for 5 Spins.\n\nFAQ\nHow can I use the Free Spins?\nThere are two ways: the first is that at least 3 Scatters land on the reels, the second is to buy the feature by clicking on the Buy Free Spins box at a cost of 100 times the bet.\n\nCan I play Gods of Giza on a tablet?\nYes, this slot is built in HTML5, so it works on every mobile device, as well as on the computer.\n\nWhat volatility does Gods of Giza have?\nThe volatility is high, it is not easy to win, but you could be rewarded with substantial prizes!\n            ",
