Che siate appassionati di film horror classici o di gore, probabilmente troverete un gioco di slot che si adatta alle vostre esigenze.

La volatilità è anche un po’ più bassa della media, il che rende molto facile ottenere qualche piccola vincita all’inizio del gioco. Volete saperne di più sullo spettacolo a cui state per assistere?

Bene, eccone una per voi! Si chiama Creepy Carnival, è stato realizzato da NoLimit City e ha tutte le caratteristiche oscure e contorte che volete in una spaventosa slot online. Pensate all’American Horror Story e a Stephen King’s IT; gli amanti di un vero e proprio freak show si divertiranno da matti giocando a Creepy Carnival. Il gioco beneficia di uno stile da cartone animato, ma non va sottovalutato. La grafica è stupefacente e le creature sui rulli sono piuttosto, beh, raccapriccianti. Tuttavia, non li vorremmo in nessun altro modo!\nCreepy Carnival sta navigando sull’onda di American Horror Story e sta portando i giocatori a un freak show come nessun altro. L’ambiente oscuro e misterioso del gioco nasconde strane creature, pronte a stupirvi e a spaventarvi allo stesso tempo. L’uso della grafica dei cartoni animati è stata un’idea brillante che fa sembrare Creepy Carnival come nessun altro slot del genere.\nLe bobine stesse occupano la maggior parte dello spazio sullo schermo, con una barra di comando completa proprio sotto di loro. Si intravede solo qualche tenda da circo sullo sfondo, il che rafforza l’inquietudine dell’intera scena.

Il gioco offre un giro gratis dove 3, 4 o 5 simboli Scatter innescano 10, 15 o 20 giri gratis e il numero di linee a pagamento viene raddoppiato. Esatto, altre 20 linee di vincita vengono introdotte durante i giri gratis e, per di più, le vincite vengono moltiplicate fino a 5 volte. L’emozionante giro di carnevale dei giri gratis può essere prolungato per altri 3 giri con l’aiuto di due indovini Scatters.\nLa visita al circo dovrebbe portare frequenti guadagni, ma spesso si atterra su scala ridotta.

Il tasso di rendimento non viene rivelato e la tabella dei pagamenti elenca i simboli dei clown come quello con il valore più alto di 300 volte la posta in gioco. Rispetto ad altre slot di NoLimit City, Creepy Carnival ospita un gruppo di giocatori con un budget leggermente più ristretto, in quanto permette scommesse fino a 50 crediti.\nI giocatori possono sperimentare un altro giro premio riempiendo lo speciale contatore di stelle sopra i rulli. Una volta guadagnate 13 stelle dai personaggi/dipendenti del Creepy Carnival attiverete un Star Spin, un re-spin con la posta in palio che rappresenta la media di tutte le poste in palio giocate finora. I Wilds rimangono bloccati durante Star Spin. Il simbolo della tigre posa per uno Sticky Wild abbastanza spesso, e la combinazione di esso con rigiri e moltiplicatori fino a 3x la scommessa può essere abbastanza lucrativa.\nI giocatori hanno ancora qualche opzione in più per ottenere premi più alti nel Creepy Carnival. Si può iniziare tenendo d’occhio la tigre, che è il jolly del gioco. L’indovino farà la parte dello scatter, in grado di assegnare fino a 20 giri gratis. Si noti che 20 linee di pagamento extra vengono attivate ogni volta che si entra nella modalità spin gratuita, che può anche assegnare moltiplicatori casuali che arrivano fino a x5.\nGià dal gioco base, le combinazioni vincenti innescheranno dei respingi liberi che aumenteranno il moltiplicatore di vincita attuale ad ogni passo. Mentre si è intrappolati in una reazione a catena di respins, i respins Wild diventano Sticky e rimarranno in posizione per tutto il tempo in cui si continua a vincere. Questa da sola è una potente caratteristica speciale che ci ha sbloccato alcuni premi in denaro molto interessanti per noi.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nÈ ancora possibile trovare alcuni elementi comuni con altri giochi di slot come Break Da Bank Again di Microgaming o Viking’s Voyage di RTP.

NoLimit City developers, for example, have chosen to stick to a cartoon-ish atmosphere while painting the strange sideshow phenomenon in the background of Creepy Carnival, and the result is quite impactful.\n\nCreepy Carnival is a video slot game that knows how to keep players interested with bonus features and generous cash rewards. The volatility is also slightly lower than average, making it very easy to get some small wins at the beginning of the game. Want to know more about the show you're about to witness? Then take a close look at our full review of Creepy Carnival.\n\nSpooky Graphics\nSome people love horror movies, some people love horror slot machines - they make us feel alive, right? Well, here's one for you! It's called Creepy Carnival, it's made by NoLimit City and it has all the dark and twisted features you want in a scary online slot. Think American Horror Story and Stephen King's IT; lovers of a true freak show will have a blast playing Creepy Carnival. The game benefits from a cartoon-ish style, but don't underestimate it. The graphics are stunning and the creatures on the reels are quite, well, creepy. However, we wouldn't want them any other way!\n\nCreepy Carnival is riding the wave of American Horror Story and is taking players to a freak show like no other. The dark and mysterious environment of the game hides strange creatures, ready to amaze and scare you at the same time. The use of cartoon-ish graphics was a brilliant idea that makes Creepy Carnival seem like no other slot of its kind.\n\nThe reels themselves take up most of the space on the screen, with a full command bar just below them. Only a few circus tents are visible in the background, which reinforces the unease of the entire scene. So, if you're not too scared yet, let's move on and find out more about the gameplay.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nOnce the spooky adventure begins, the reel paths will soon take you to special territory. With two main features, Creepy Carnival truly offers a thrilling and fun experience that could end in big wins. The game offers a free spin where 3, 4 or 5 scatter symbols trigger 10, 15 or 20 free spins and the number of paylines is doubled. That's right, another 20 paylines are introduced during free spins and, moreover, winnings are multiplied up to 5 times. The exciting carnival spin of free spins can be extended for another 3 spins with the help of two fortune-teller scatters.\n\nThe circus visit should bring frequent earnings, but often you land on a small scale. Since Creepy Carnival has a low to medium volatility, it is likely that you will get some daring wins at the beginning of the game and will continue to accumulate small wins rather than hitting big. The payout rate is not revealed and the paytable lists clown symbols as the highest value at 300 times the stake. Compared to other NoLimit City slots, Creepy Carnival hosts a group of players with a slightly smaller budget, as it allows bets up to 50 credits.\n\nPlayers can experience another bonus spin by filling the special star counter above the reels. Once you earn 13 stars from the characters / employees of the Creepy Carnival, you will activate a Star Spin, a re-spin with a stake that represents the average of all stakes played so far. Wilds remain locked during Star Spin. The tiger symbol poses for a Sticky Wild often enough, and the combination of it with respins and multipliers up to 3x the bet can be quite lucrative.\n\nPlayers still have a few more options to get higher rewards in Creepy Carnival. You can start by keeping an eye on the tiger, which is the wild of the game. The fortune-teller will play the part of the scatter, able to award up to 20 free spins. Note that 20 extra paylines are activated every time you enter the free spin mode, which can also award random multipliers up to x5.\n\nAlready from the base game, winning combinations will trigger free respins that will increase the current win multiplier at each step. While trapped in a chain reaction of respins, Wild respins become Sticky and remain in place for as long as you continue to win. This alone is a powerful special feature that has unlocked some very interesting cash prizes for us.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nYou can still find some common elements with other slot games such as Microgaming's Break Da Bank Again or RTP's Viking's Voyage. While both of these games obviously look very different, they both share the same basic gameplay and free spin feature as Creepy Carnival.",

Whether you're a classic horror movie fan or a gore enthusiast, you'll likely find a slot game that fits your needs. NoLimit City developers, for example, have chosen to stick with a cartoonish atmosphere while depicting the strange sideshow phenomenon behind Creepy Carnival, and the result is rather striking. \n\nCreepy Carnival is a slot video game that knows how to keep players engaged with bonus features and generous cash rewards. Its volatility is also a bit lower than average, making it very easy to get some small winnings at the beginning of the game. Want to know more about the show you're about to witness? Then take a look at our complete Creepy Carnival review. \n\nGhoulish Graphics \nSome people love horror movies, some people love horror slot machines - they make us feel alive, don't they? Well, here's one for you! It's called Creepy Carnival, made by NoLimit City, and it has all the dark and twisted features you want in an eerie online slot. Think American Horror Story and Stephen King's IT; freak show lovers will have a blast playing Creepy Carnival. The game benefits from a cartoonish style, but it should not be underestimated. The graphics are stunning, and the creatures on the reels are rather, well, horrifying. However, we wouldn't want them any other way!\n\nCreepy Carnival is riding the wave of American Horror Story and taking players to a freak show like no other. The game's dark and mysterious ambiance hides strange creatures, ready to amaze and scare you at the same time. The use of cartoon graphics was a brilliant idea that makes Creepy Carnival stand out as unlike any other slot of its kind.\n\nThe reels themselves occupy most of the space on the screen, with a full command bar just below them. You only catch a glimpse of some circus tents in the background, which reinforces the unease of the whole scene. So, if you're not too frightened yet, let's move on and find out more about the gameplay.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine \nOnce the eerie adventure begins, the trail of the reels will soon take you into a special territory. With two major features, Creepy Carnival truly offers a frighteningly fun experience that could end with big winnings. The game offers a free spin where 3, 4 or 5 Scatter symbols trigger 10, 15 or 20 free spins, and the number of pay lines is doubled. Exactly, another 20 winning lines are introduced during free spins, and to top it off, winnings are multiplied up to 5 times. The exciting carnival ride of free spins can be extended for another 3 spins with the help of two fortune teller Scatters.\n\nVisiting the circus should bring frequent wins, but often, you land on a small scale. Given that Creepy Carnival has low to medium volatility, it's likely that you'll get courageous victories at the beginning of the game and will continue to accumulate small wins rather than hitting it big. The payout rate is not disclosed, and the paytable lists clown symbols as the highest valued symbol at 300 times the bet. Compared to other NoLimit City slots, Creepy Carnival plays host to a group of players with a slightly tighter budget as it allows bets up to 50 credits.\n\nPlayers can experience another bonus spin by filling the special star counter above the reels. Once you earn 13 stars from the characters/employees of Creepy Carnival, you will trigger a Star Spin, a re-spin with the stake representing the average of all stakes played so far. The Wilds remain locked during the Star Spin. The tiger symbol poses for a Sticky Wild quite often, and combining it with re-spins and multipliers up to 3x the bet can be quite lucrative.\n\nPlayers still have a few more options to get higher prizes in Creepy Carnival. You can start by keeping an eye on the tiger, which is the game's wild. The fortune teller will play the part of the scatter, able to award up to 20 free spins. Note that 20 extra pay lines are activated every time you enter free spin mode, which can also randomly award multipliers up to x5.\n\nAlready in the base game, winning combinations trigger free respins that increase the current winning multiplier at each step. While trapped in a chain reaction of respins, Wild respins become Sticky and remain in position for as long as you continue to win. This alone is a powerful special feature that has unlocked some very interesting cash prizes for us.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines \nIt is still possible to find some commonalities with other slot games like Microgaming's Break Da Bank Again or RTP's Viking's Voyage. While both of these games obviously have a very different look, they both share the same basic gameplay and free spin feature as Creepy Carnival."

However, we wouldn't want them any other way!\n\nCreepy Carnival is riding the wave of American Horror Story and taking players to a freak show like no other. The game's dark and mysterious ambiance hides strange creatures, ready to amaze and scare you at the same time. The use of cartoon graphics was a brilliant idea that makes Creepy Carnival stand out as unlike any other slot of its kind.\n\nThe reels themselves occupy most of the space on the screen, with a full command bar just below them. You only catch a glimpse of some circus tents in the background, which reinforces the unease of the whole scene. So, if you're not too frightened yet, let's move on and find out more about the gameplay.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine \nOnce the eerie adventure begins, the trail of the reels will soon take you into a special territory. With two major features, Creepy Carnival truly offers a frighteningly fun experience that could end with big winnings. The game offers a free spin where 3, 4 or 5 Scatter symbols trigger 10, 15 or 20 free spins, and the number of pay lines is doubled. Exactly, another 20 winning lines are introduced during free spins, and to top it off, winnings are multiplied up to 5 times. The exciting carnival ride of free spins can be extended for another 3 spins with the help of two fortune teller Scatters.\n\nVisiting the circus should bring frequent wins, but often, you land on a small scale. Given that Creepy Carnival has low to medium volatility, it's likely that you'll get courageous victories at the beginning of the game and will continue to accumulate small wins rather than hitting it big. The payout rate is not disclosed, and the paytable lists clown symbols as the highest valued symbol at 300 times the bet. Compared to other NoLimit City slots, Creepy Carnival plays host to a group of players with a slightly tighter budget as it allows bets up to 50 credits.\n\nPlayers can experience another bonus spin by filling the special star counter above the reels. Once you earn 13 stars from the characters/employees of Creepy Carnival, you will trigger a Star Spin, a re-spin with the stake representing the average of all stakes played so far. The Wilds remain locked during the Star Spin. The tiger symbol poses for a Sticky Wild quite often, and combining it with re-spins and multipliers up to 3x the bet can be quite lucrative.\n\nPlayers still have a few more options to get higher prizes in Creepy Carnival. You can start by keeping an eye on the tiger, which is the game's wild. The fortune teller will play the part of the scatter, able to award up to 20 free spins. Note that 20 extra pay lines are activated every time you enter free spin mode, which can also randomly award multipliers up to x5.\n\nAlready in the base game, winning combinations trigger free respins that increase the current winning multiplier at each step. While trapped in a chain reaction of respins, Wild respins become Sticky and remain in position for as long as you continue to win. This alone is a powerful special feature that has unlocked some very interesting cash prizes for us.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines \nIt is still possible to find some commonalities with other slot games like Microgaming's Break Da Bank Again or RTP's Viking's Voyage. While both of these games obviously have a very different look, they both share the same basic gameplay and free spin feature as Creepy Carnival.\n            ",

The game features cartoonish graphics depicting a strange sideshow phenomenon. Creepy Carnival offers lower than average volatility, making it easy for players to get some small winnings at the beginning of the game. It also provides bonus features and cash rewards. \n\nGraphics\n\nCreepy Carnival has stunning graphics that depict a spooky and mysterious ambiance. The game benefits from a cartoonish style with strange creatures on the reels. The dark and twisted features make the game eerie yet exciting. The use of circus tents in the background of the reels reinforces the unease of the whole scene.\n\nFree Spins\n\nCreepy Carnival offers a free spin where 3, 4 or 5 Scatter symbols trigger 10, 15 or 20 free spins, respectively. Another 20 winning lines are introduced during free spins, and winnings are multiplied up to 5 times. The carnival ride of free spins can be extended for another 3 spins with the help of two fortune teller Scatters. Note that the fortune teller also plays the part of the scatter, able to award up to 20 free spins.\n\nBonus Features\n\nCreepy Carnival has two major bonus features. The first is the free spin feature. The second bonus feature is a re-spin with the stake representing the average of all stakes played so far. The Wilds remain locked during the Star Spin. The tiger symbol poses for a Sticky Wild quite often, and combining it with re-spins and multipliers up to 3x the bet can be quite lucrative. Winning combinations trigger free respins that increase the current winning multiplier at each step. While trapped in a chain reaction of respins, Wild respins become Sticky and remain in position for as long as you continue to win.\n\nVolatility\n\nCreepy Carnival has low to medium volatility, making it likely that players will get small wins rather than hitting it big. However, the payout rate is not disclosed, and the paytable lists clown symbols as the highest valued symbol at 300 times the bet. Compared to other NoLimit City slots, Creepy Carnival is suitable for players with a slightly tighter budget as it allows bets up to 50 credits.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nDespite the game's low to medium volatility, Creepy Carnival still offers some interesting cash prizes. Winning combinations trigger free respins that increase the current winning multiplier at each step. While trapped in a chain reaction of respins, Wild respins become Sticky and remain in position for as long as you continue to win. The fortune teller also plays the part of the scatter, able to award up to 20 free spins. In free spin mode, 20 extra pay lines are activated, which can randomly award multipliers up to x5.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay of Creepy Carnival is straightforward and easy to navigate. The reels occupy most of the space on the screen, with a full command bar just below them. Creepy Carnival offers players several ways to get higher prizes, including the Wilds, free spins, and respins. Players can experience another bonus spin by filling the special star counter above the reels. Once players earn 13 stars from the characters/employees of Creepy Carnival, they will trigger a Star Spin, a re-spin with the stake representing the average of all stakes played so far.\n\n        \n            ",

Whether you're a classic horror movie fan or a gore enthusiast, you'll likely find a slot game that fits your needs. NoLimit City developers, for example, have chosen to stick with a cartoonish atmosphere while depicting the strange sideshow phenomenon behind Creepy Carnival, and the result is rather striking. \n\nCreepy Carnival is a slot video game that knows how to keep players engaged with bonus features and generous cash rewards. Its volatility is also a bit lower than average, making it very easy to get some small winnings at the beginning of the game. Want to know more about the show you're about to witness? Then take a look at our complete Creepy Carnival review. \n\nGhoulish Graphics \nSome people love horror movies, some people love horror slot machines - they make us feel alive, don't they? Well, here's one for you! It's called Creepy Carnival, made by NoLimit City, and it has all the dark and twisted features you want in an eerie online slot. Think American Horror Story and Stephen King's IT; freak show lovers will have a blast playing Creepy Carnival. The game benefits from a cartoonish style, but it should not be underestimated. The graphics are stunning, and the creatures on the reels are rather, well, horrifying. However, we wouldn't want them any other way!\n\nCreepy Carnival is riding the wave of American Horror Story and taking players to a freak show like no other. The game's dark and mysterious ambiance hides strange creatures, ready to amaze and scare you at the same time. The use of cartoon graphics was a brilliant idea that makes Creepy Carnival stand out as unlike any other slot of its kind.\n\nThe reels themselves occupy most of the space on the screen, with a full command bar just below them. You only catch a glimpse of some circus tents in the background, which reinforces the unease of the whole scene. So, if you're not too frightened yet, let's move on and find out more about the gameplay.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine \nOnce the eerie adventure begins, the trail of the reels will soon take you into a special territory. With two major features, Creepy Carnival truly offers a frighteningly fun experience that could end with big winnings. The game offers a free spin where 3, 4 or 5 Scatter symbols trigger 10, 15 or 20 free spins, and the number of pay lines is doubled. Exactly, another 20 winning lines are introduced during free spins, and to top it off, winnings are multiplied up to 5 times. The exciting carnival ride of free spins can be extended for another 3 spins with the help of two fortune teller Scatters.\n\nVisiting the circus should bring frequent wins, but often, you land on a small scale. Given that Creepy Carnival has low to medium volatility, it's likely that you'll get courageous victories at the beginning of the game and will continue to accumulate small wins rather than hitting it big. The payout rate is not disclosed, and the paytable lists clown symbols as the highest valued symbol at 300 times the bet. Compared to other NoLimit City slots, Creepy Carnival plays host to a group of players with a slightly tighter budget as it allows bets up to 50 credits.\n\nPlayers can experience another bonus spin by filling the special star counter above the reels. Once you earn 13 stars from the characters/employees of Creepy Carnival, you will trigger a Star Spin, a re-spin with the stake representing the average of all stakes played so far. The Wilds remain locked during the Star Spin. The tiger symbol poses for a Sticky Wild quite often, and combining it with re-spins and multipliers up to 3x the bet can be quite lucrative.\n\nPlayers still have a few more options to get higher prizes in Creepy Carnival. You can start by keeping an eye on the tiger, which is the game's wild. The fortune teller will play the part of the scatter, able to award up to 20 free spins. Note that 20 extra pay lines are activated every time you enter free spin mode, which can also randomly award multipliers up to x5.\n\nAlready in the base game, winning combinations trigger free respins that increase the current winning multiplier at each step. While trapped in a chain reaction of respins, Wild respins become Sticky and remain in position for as long as you continue to win. This alone is a powerful special feature that has unlocked some very interesting cash prizes for us.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines \nIt is still possible to find some commonalities with other slot games like Microgaming's Break Da Bank Again or RTP's Viking's Voyage. While both of these games obviously have a very different look, they both share the same basic gameplay and free spin feature as Creepy Carnival.\n            ",

Whether you're a classic horror movie fan or a gore enthusiast, you'll likely find a slot game that fits your needs. NoLimit City developers, for example, have chosen to stick with a cartoonish atmosphere while depicting the strange sideshow phenomenon behind Creepy Carnival, and the result is rather striking. \n\nCreepy Carnival is a slot video game that knows how to keep players engaged with bonus features and generous cash rewards. Its volatility is also a bit lower than average, making it very easy to get some small winnings at the beginning of the game. Want to know more about the show you're about to witness? Then take a look at our complete Creepy Carnival review. \n\nGhoulish Graphics \nSome people love horror movies, some people love horror slot machines - they make us feel alive, don't they? Well, here's one for you! It's called Creepy Carnival, made by NoLimit City, and it has all the dark and twisted features you want in an eerie online slot. Think American Horror Story and Stephen King's IT; freak show lovers will have a blast playing Creepy Carnival. The game benefits from a cartoonish style, but it should not be underestimated. The graphics are stunning, and the creatures on the reels are rather, well, horrifying. However, we wouldn't want them any other way!\n\nCreepy Carnival is riding the wave of American Horror Story and taking players to a freak show like no other. The game's dark and mysterious ambiance hides strange creatures, ready to amaze and scare you at the same time. The use of cartoon graphics was a brilliant idea that makes Creepy Carnival stand out as unlike any other slot of its kind.\n\nThe reels themselves occupy most of the space on the screen, with a full command bar just below them. You only catch a glimpse of some circus tents in the background, which reinforces the unease of the whole scene. So, if you're not too frightened yet, let's move on and find out more about the gameplay.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine \nOnce the eerie adventure begins, the trail of the reels will soon take you into a special territory. With two major features, Creepy Carnival truly offers a frighteningly fun experience that could end with big winnings. The game offers a free spin where 3, 4 or 5 Scatter symbols trigger 10, 15 or 20 free spins, and the number of pay lines is doubled. Exactly, another 20 winning lines are introduced during free spins, and to top it off, winnings are multiplied up to 5 times. The exciting carnival ride of free spins can be extended for another 3 spins with the help of two fortune teller Scatters.\n\nVisiting the circus should bring frequent wins, but often, you land on a small scale. Given that Creepy Carnival has low to medium volatility, it's likely that you'll get courageous victories at the beginning of the game and will continue to accumulate small wins rather than hitting it big. The payout rate is not disclosed, and the paytable lists clown symbols as the highest valued symbol at 300 times the bet. Compared to other NoLimit City slots, Creepy Carnival plays host to a group of players with a slightly tighter budget as it allows bets up to 50 credits.\n\nPlayers can experience another bonus spin by filling the special star counter above the reels. Once you earn 13 stars from the characters/employees of Creepy Carnival, you will trigger a Star Spin, a re-spin with the stake representing the average of all stakes played so far. The Wilds remain locked during the Star Spin. The tiger symbol poses for a Sticky Wild quite often, and combining it with re-spins and multipliers up to 3x the bet can be quite lucrative.\n\nPlayers still have a few more options to get higher prizes in Creepy Carnival. You can start by keeping an eye on the tiger, which is the game's wild. The fortune teller will play the part of the scatter, able to award up to 20 free spins. Note that 20 extra pay lines are activated every time you enter free spin mode, which can also randomly award multipliers up to x5.\n\nAlready in the base game, winning combinations trigger free respins that increase the current winning multiplier at each step. While trapped in a chain reaction of respins, Wild respins become Sticky and remain in position for as long as you continue to win. This alone is a powerful special feature that has unlocked some very interesting cash prizes for us.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines \nIt is still possible to find some commonalities with other slot games like Microgaming's Break Da Bank Again or RTP's Viking's Voyage. While both of these games obviously have a very different look, they both share the same basic gameplay and free spin feature as Creepy Carnival.\n        ",
