Blueprint Gaming ha trasformato in realtà questo mondo, creando una slot che, grazie ai suoi bonus, permette di sbloccare un moltiplicatore di scommesse pari a 1000x la puntata effettuata.

Sì e ora scopriremo il perché!\nGrafica della slot\nQuando apriamo il gioco di King Kong Cash notiamo subito che il nostro King è ben lontano da quel personaggio così oscuro e spaventoso che venne descritto e rappresentato nel film e nel suo remake. Si trova seduto su un prestigioso trono di pietra, che si pone alla sinistra dei rulli sui quali potrai tentare la fortuna. Qui appaiono, gemme, montagne di oro e tanti simboli da poter unire per trovare le combinazioni vincenti. La slot ha 5 rulli, 3 file e 20 linee di pagamento, e permette di giocare con il logo del gioco, le carte standard J, Q, K e A, un rinoceronte, una tigre, un coccodrillo e un pappagallo pirata. Il barile è il simbolo jolly che potrà sostituire qualsiasi altro simbolo presente sul tabellone, fatta eccezione per il simbolo Scatter, che ovviamente è rappresentato da King Kong.\nLe grafiche in 3D sono davvero ben fatte e si nota un design di alto livello.

Altra funzionalità è Barrel Blast, con un cannone che spara sui rulli rivelando i simboli di ogni casella: lo scopo è trovare 3 icone a forma di botte, per poter ottenere vincite importanti. Non possono poi mancare i giri gratuiti, che sono 10, con ulteriori spin da vincere e un moltiplicatore di vincita davvero sorprendente. Il Golden Kong è un’altra variante che offre free Spin, e ti porta su un nuovo set di rulli con il doppio numero di linee.\nE che dire poi del bonus Big Monkey Bonus, il più prestigioso di tutti, con un moltiplicatore di puntate pari a 1000x! Ti basterà cliccare su una delle 10 banane che vedi sullo schermo e scoprirai quanto vinci!\nConsiderazioni finali\nSiamo giunti alla fine di questa recensione di King Kong, che nel complesso ci ha davvero soddisfatti.

King Kong Cash is based on that gorilla that scared so many people and introduced us to the ethereal beauty of Jessica Lange. On online gaming platforms, it will help you win big prizes in a very simple way. Blueprint Gaming has brought this world to life by creating a slot machine that, thanks to its bonuses, allows you to unlock a 1000x betting multiplier. The only thing that stands between a player and an incredible win is this monkey that will move on your screen. Is it worth the risk? Yes, and now we'll find out why!\n\nSlot graphics\n\nWhen we open the King Kong Cash game, we immediately notice that our King is far from the dark and scary character described and represented in the movie and its remake. He is sitting on a prestigious stone throne, which is positioned to the left of the reels on which you will try your luck. Here you will see gems, mountains of gold, and many symbols that can be combined to find winning combinations. The slot has 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 paylines, and allows you to play with the game logo, standard J, Q, K and A cards, a rhino, a tiger, a crocodile, and a pirate parrot. The barrel is the wild symbol that can replace any other symbol on the board, except for the scatter symbol, which is of course represented by King Kong.\n\nThe 3D graphics are really well done and there is a high-level design. Not to be outdone is the soundtrack, which is a fun bongo that will not make you nervous during your gaming session.\n\nFunctions and bonuses\n\nAmong the many features that this beautiful slot offers, we cannot fail to mention the King Kong Trail Bonus, which transports you to a second screen with a ladder full of bonuses! Another feature is Barrel Blast, with a cannon that shoots at the reels revealing the symbols of each square: the aim is to find 3 barrel-shaped icons to get important winnings. Then there are the free spins, which are 10, with additional spins to win and a truly surprising win multiplier. Golden Kong is another variant that offers free spins and takes you to a new set of reels with double the number of lines.\n\nAnd what about the Big Monkey Bonus, the most prestigious of them all, with a bet multiplier of 1000x!

King Kong Cash is based on that gorilla that scared so many people and introduced us to the ethereal beauty of Jessica Lange. On online gaming platforms, it will help you win big prizes in a very simple way. Blueprint Gaming has brought this world to life by creating a slot machine that, thanks to its bonuses, allows you to unlock a 1000x betting multiplier. The only thing that stands between a player and an incredible win is this monkey that will move on your screen. Is it worth the risk? Yes, and now we'll find out why!\n\nSlot graphics\n\nWhen we open the King Kong Cash game, we immediately notice that our King is far from the dark and scary character described and represented in the movie and its remake. He is sitting on a prestigious stone throne, which is positioned to the left of the reels on which you will try your luck. Here you will see gems, mountains of gold, and many symbols that can be combined to find winning combinations. The slot has 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 paylines, and allows you to play with the game logo, standard J, Q, K and A cards, a rhino, a tiger, a crocodile, and a pirate parrot. The barrel is the wild symbol that can replace any other symbol on the board, except for the scatter symbol, which is of course represented by King Kong.\n\nThe 3D graphics are really well done and there is a high-level design. Not to be outdone is the soundtrack, which is a fun bongo that will not make you nervous during your gaming session.\n\nFunctions and bonuses\n\nAmong the many features that this beautiful slot offers, we cannot fail to mention the King Kong Trail Bonus, which transports you to a second screen with a ladder full of bonuses! Another feature is Barrel Blast, with a cannon that shoots at the reels revealing the symbols of each square: the aim is to find 3 barrel-shaped icons to get important winnings. Then there are the free spins, which are 10, with additional spins to win and a truly surprising win multiplier. Golden Kong is another variant that offers free spins and takes you to a new set of reels with double the number of lines.\n\nAnd what about the Big Monkey Bonus, the most prestigious of them all, with a bet multiplier of 1000x! All you have to do is click on one of the 10 bananas you see on the screen and find out how much you win!\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWe have come to the end of this review of King Kong, which overall has really satisfied us. It uses a good dose of energy, bright colors, and a pinch of simplicity in the structure of the game to surprise and entertain players. It's really hard to get tired of this slot machine!\n            ",

The 5-reel, 3-row, and 20 payline slot is vibrant and colorful, with high-quality 3D graphics and a fun bongo soundtrack. The symbols on the board include standard playing card values, a rhino, a tiger, a crocodile, and a pirate parrot. Players can enjoy the game on desktop or mobile and experience the thrill of King Kong from the comfort of their own home.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nThe slot symbols are on-theme, including the game logo, standard J, Q, K and A cards, a rhino, a tiger, a crocodile, and a pirate parrot. Meanwhile, the wild symbol is depicted as a barrel and can substitute any other symbol on the board except for the scatter symbol, which is King Kong himself. The game has several exciting features, including the King Kong Trail Bonus, Barrel Blast, free spins, and Golden Kong. These features keep the game interesting, and the different bonuses offer opportunities for players to unlock multipliers and substantial payouts.\n\nBonus Features\n\nOne of King Kong Cash's most unique aspects is the sheer number of bonus features available. The King Kong Trail Bonus takes players to a second screen with a ladder full of bonuses. Barrel Blast uses a cannon to shoot at the reels, revealing the symbols of each square, with the goal of finding three barrel-shaped icons and winning important prizes. Free spins unlock additional bonus spins with increasing win multipliers. In Golden Kong mode, players are transported to a new set of reels with double the number of paylines. However, the most impressive bonus feature is the Big Monkey Bonus, which offers players a chance to unlock a 1000x betting multiplier with a simple click on one of the ten bananas that appear on the screen.\n\nWild Symbol\n\nThe wild symbol in King Kong Cash is the barrel and can replace any other symbol on the board, excluding King Kong himself. The barrel symbol appears regularly during normal gameplay, making it easier to complete winning combinations.\n\nPayouts and Betting Options\n\nKing Kong Cash offers a range of betting options, making it accessible to all types of players. The minimum bet is 0.20 coins, while the maximum bet is 200 coins per spin. The payout percentage is 95.8%, which is average for online slots. However, the game's bonus features provide opportunities for significant payouts, with the most substantial payouts available in the Big Monkey Bonus. Players can unlock the 1000x betting multiplier by clicking on one of the ten bananas that appear on the screen during the bonus round.\n\n        \n            ",

Yes, and now we'll find out why!\n\nSlot graphics\n\nWhen we open the King Kong Cash game, we immediately notice that our King is far from the dark and scary character described and represented in the movie and its remake.

King Kong Cash is based on that gorilla that scared so many people and introduced us to the ethereal beauty of Jessica Lange. On online gaming platforms, it will help you win big prizes in a very simple way. Blueprint Gaming has brought this world to life by creating a slot machine that, thanks to its bonuses, allows you to unlock a 1000x betting multiplier. The only thing that stands between a player and an incredible win is this monkey that will move on your screen. Is it worth the risk? Yes, and now we'll find out why!\n\nSlot graphics\n\nWhen we open the King Kong Cash game, we immediately notice that our King is far from the dark and scary character described and represented in the movie and its remake. He is sitting on a prestigious stone throne, which is positioned to the left of the reels on which you will try your luck. Here you will see gems, mountains of gold, and many symbols that can be combined to find winning combinations. The slot has 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 paylines, and allows you to play with the game logo, standard J, Q, K and A cards, a rhino, a tiger, a crocodile, and a pirate parrot. The barrel is the wild symbol that can replace any other symbol on the board, except for the scatter symbol, which is of course represented by King Kong.\n\nThe 3D graphics are really well done and there is a high-level design. Not to be outdone is the soundtrack, which is a fun bongo that will not make you nervous during your gaming session.\n\nFunctions and bonuses\n\nAmong the many features that this beautiful slot offers, we cannot fail to mention the King Kong Trail Bonus, which transports you to a second screen with a ladder full of bonuses! Another feature is Barrel Blast, with a cannon that shoots at the reels revealing the symbols of each square: the aim is to find 3 barrel-shaped icons to get important winnings. Then there are the free spins, which are 10, with additional spins to win and a truly surprising win multiplier. Golden Kong is another variant that offers free spins and takes you to a new set of reels with double the number of lines.\n\nAnd what about the Big Monkey Bonus, the most prestigious of them all, with a bet multiplier of 1000x! All you have to do is click on one of the 10 bananas you see on the screen and find out how much you win!\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWe have come to the end of this review of King Kong, which overall has really satisfied us. It uses a good dose of energy, bright colors, and a pinch of simplicity in the structure of the game to surprise and entertain players. It's really hard to get tired of this slot machine!\n        ",
