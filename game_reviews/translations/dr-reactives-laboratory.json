The epic 8×8 reels provide you with plenty of symbols to play with, as you hunt to collect those that pay out the important clusters. With wild multipliers, free spins, and three progressive jackpots to win, this slot is a chemistry lesson you won't want to skip.\n\nImagine entering Dr Reactive's Laboratory, the unusual 8-reel cluster pay game from WMS and Red 7, where your goal is to concoct explosive chemical cocktails. Land clusters of 5 or matching symbols to create a winning combination that triggers a cascade. Land special symbol combinations to clear reels, rows, and low value symbols. Trigger the free spins feature by landing at least 5 successive cascade wins. Here, wild multipliers can send payouts rocketing up to 10x. Enter the laboratory for bets from 20 cents up to 100 euros per spin. \n\nReleased by the innovative casino game developer Red7, the reels of Dr Reactive's Laboratory are set against a mysterious machine. Symbols include green, purple, pink, and orange vials, a lightning bolt, and a DNA strand. You will also notice a letter W in glowing, radioactive style, which acts as the wild, and an atom complete with electrons that acts as a scatter to trigger two unique bonus features. \n\nThere are no traditional paylines in Dr Reactive's Laboratory. To create a winning combination, you must land a cluster of 5 or more matching symbols. These can be formed vertically and/or horizontally. The more symbols in the cluster, the greater the potential reward. If you find 15 DNA symbols in a cluster, you will be awarded a prize equal to 50 times your total bet. \n\nThe Dr Reactive Laboratory slot uses a cascade reel mechanic. After a successful cascade win, the winning symbols are removed, and new ones fall down from above, giving you a new opportunity for a win. Cascades continue until a new winning cluster is created. \n\nHelping your chances of winning is the W symbol, the wild. As usual, it substitutes for all standard symbols and can be equipped with multipliers that can increase your winnings by 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x in the base game. In the happy circumstance of landing more than one wild multiplier in the same combination, the amounts are combined for an even greater boost. \n\nThe atom symbol joins the standard symbols and the wild character. This triggers a special reaction when it appears next to the DNA symbol. All symbols on the reel and row where the DNA symbol is located are removed, and a new cascade follows. A DNA reaction also awards a payout equal to your total stake. Expect even more explosive action when the atom lands next to the lightning bolt symbol. Here, all copies of the symbol with the lowest value on the reels are removed, followed by a new cascade. \n\nThe Free Falls function offers 10 or 15 free spins. It's activated by landing 5 or more cascade wins in a single paid game. To get 15 free spins, you'll need to land 7 successive cascade wins. You can keep track of your behaviour through the counter next to the reels. \n\nJust like in the base game, the W symbol that represents the wild comes with multipliers. However, they are larger during free spins and can increase payouts by 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x or 10x. In the base game, the wilds disappear after a successful cascade. This is not the case during the function, however. Instead, they stay in position. Their multiplier decreases by 2x with each game until it reaches a minimum of 2x. Only then do they disappear from the grid. \n\nAs part of the Mega Drop mechanism, you have the chance to land one of the Minor, Major or Epic Jackpots. The latter offers prizes of up to 200,000 euros if you're lucky. \n\nSimilar Slots \nThe Cluster Pays mechanism always reminds us of NetEnt's Aloha! Cluster Pays slot machine. This was the first game with this game mechanic. If you haven't tried this game yet, you have to play it. It has a fun tiki theme with Sticky Respins and free spins. It may seem like a very different game, but there are definitely many similarities to be found with the Dr Reactive's Laboratory online slot.",

This triggers a special reaction when it appears next to the DNA symbol. All symbols on the reel and row where the DNA symbol is located are removed, and a new cascade follows. A DNA reaction also awards a payout equal to your total stake. Expect even more explosive action when the atom lands next to the lightning bolt symbol. Here, all copies of the symbol with the lowest value on the reels are removed, followed by a new cascade. \n\nThe Free Falls function offers 10 or 15 free spins. It's activated by landing 5 or more cascade wins in a single paid game. To get 15 free spins, you'll need to land 7 successive cascade wins. You can keep track of your behaviour through the counter next to the reels. \n\nJust like in the base game, the W symbol that represents the wild comes with multipliers. However, they are larger during free spins and can increase payouts by 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x or 10x. In the base game, the wilds disappear after a successful cascade. This is not the case during the function, however. Instead, they stay in position. Their multiplier decreases by 2x with each game until it reaches a minimum of 2x. Only then do they disappear from the grid. \n\nAs part of the Mega Drop mechanism, you have the chance to land one of the Minor, Major or Epic Jackpots. The latter offers prizes of up to 200,000 euros if you're lucky. \n\nSimilar Slots \nThe Cluster Pays mechanism always reminds us of NetEnt's Aloha! Cluster Pays slot machine. This was the first game with this game mechanic. If you haven't tried this game yet, you have to play it. It has a fun tiki theme with Sticky Respins and free spins. It may seem like a very different game, but there are definitely many similarities to be found with the Dr Reactive's Laboratory online slot."

This game is one we are not neutral about as we believe that the chemistry between you and this slot will be explosive! With cascade reels and the cluster pay mechanic, you are given more chances to win big in this retro cartoon-style slot. The epic 8×8 reels provide you with plenty of symbols to play with, as you hunt to collect those that pay out the important clusters. With wild multipliers, free spins, and three progressive jackpots to win, this slot is a chemistry lesson you won't want to skip.\n\nImagine entering Dr Reactive's Laboratory, the unusual 8-reel cluster pay game from WMS and Red 7, where your goal is to concoct explosive chemical cocktails. Land clusters of 5 or matching symbols to create a winning combination that triggers a cascade. Land special symbol combinations to clear reels, rows, and low value symbols. Trigger the free spins feature by landing at least 5 successive cascade wins. Here, wild multipliers can send payouts rocketing up to 10x. Enter the laboratory for bets from 20 cents up to 100 euros per spin. \n\nReleased by the innovative casino game developer Red7, the reels of Dr Reactive's Laboratory are set against a mysterious machine. Symbols include green, purple, pink, and orange vials, a lightning bolt, and a DNA strand. You will also notice a letter W in glowing, radioactive style, which acts as the wild, and an atom complete with electrons that acts as a scatter to trigger two unique bonus features. \n\nThere are no traditional paylines in Dr Reactive's Laboratory. To create a winning combination, you must land a cluster of 5 or more matching symbols. These can be formed vertically and/or horizontally. The more symbols in the cluster, the greater the potential reward. If you find 15 DNA symbols in a cluster, you will be awarded a prize equal to 50 times your total bet. \n\nThe Dr Reactive Laboratory slot uses a cascade reel mechanic. After a successful cascade win, the winning symbols are removed, and new ones fall down from above, giving you a new opportunity for a win. Cascades continue until a new winning cluster is created. \n\nHelping your chances of winning is the W symbol, the wild. As usual, it substitutes for all standard symbols and can be equipped with multipliers that can increase your winnings by 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x in the base game. In the happy circumstance of landing more than one wild multiplier in the same combination, the amounts are combined for an even greater boost. \n\nThe atom symbol joins the standard symbols and the wild character. This triggers a special reaction when it appears next to the DNA symbol. All symbols on the reel and row where the DNA symbol is located are removed, and a new cascade follows. A DNA reaction also awards a payout equal to your total stake. Expect even more explosive action when the atom lands next to the lightning bolt symbol. Here, all copies of the symbol with the lowest value on the reels are removed, followed by a new cascade. \n\nThe Free Falls function offers 10 or 15 free spins. It's activated by landing 5 or more cascade wins in a single paid game. To get 15 free spins, you'll need to land 7 successive cascade wins. You can keep track of your behaviour through the counter next to the reels. \n\nJust like in the base game, the W symbol that represents the wild comes with multipliers. However, they are larger during free spins and can increase payouts by 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x or 10x. In the base game, the wilds disappear after a successful cascade. This is not the case during the function, however. Instead, they stay in position. Their multiplier decreases by 2x with each game until it reaches a minimum of 2x. Only then do they disappear from the grid. \n\nAs part of the Mega Drop mechanism, you have the chance to land one of the Minor, Major or Epic Jackpots. The latter offers prizes of up to 200,000 euros if you're lucky. \n\nSimilar Slots \nThe Cluster Pays mechanism always reminds us of NetEnt's Aloha! Cluster Pays slot machine. This was the first game with this game mechanic. If you haven't tried this game yet, you have to play it. It has a fun tiki theme with Sticky Respins and free spins. It may seem like a very different game, but there are definitely many similarities to be found with the Dr Reactive's Laboratory online slot.\n            ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay mechanics\nSymbols and paytable\nSpecial features (wilds, free spins, etc.)\nProgressive jackpots\nGraphics and design\nGame theme\nCluster pay mechanic\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Get ready for a fantastic reaction from the online slot game, Dr Reactive's Laboratory! This game is one we are not neutral about as we believe that the chemistry between you and this slot will be explosive! With cascade reels and the cluster pay mechanic, you are given more chances to win big in this retro cartoon-style slot. The epic 8×8 reels provide you with plenty of symbols to play with, as you hunt to collect those that pay out the important clusters. With wild multipliers, free spins, and three progressive jackpots to win, this slot is a chemistry lesson you won't want to skip.\n\nImagine entering Dr Reactive's Laboratory, the unusual 8-reel cluster pay game from WMS and Red 7, where your goal is to concoct explosive chemical cocktails. Land clusters of 5 or matching symbols to create a winning combination that triggers a cascade. Land special symbol combinations to clear reels, rows, and low value symbols. Trigger the free spins feature by landing at least 5 successive cascade wins. Here, wild multipliers can send payouts rocketing up to 10x. Enter the laboratory for bets from 20 cents up to 100 euros per spin. \n\nReleased by the innovative casino game developer Red7, the reels of Dr Reactive's Laboratory are set against a mysterious machine. Symbols include green, purple, pink, and orange vials, a lightning bolt, and a DNA strand. You will also notice a letter W in glowing, radioactive style, which acts as the wild, and an atom complete with electrons that acts as a scatter to trigger two unique bonus features. \n\nThere are no traditional paylines in Dr Reactive's Laboratory. To create a winning combination, you must land a cluster of 5 or more matching symbols. These can be formed vertically and/or horizontally. The more symbols in the cluster, the greater the potential reward. If you find 15 DNA symbols in a cluster, you will be awarded a prize equal to 50 times your total bet. \n\nThe Dr Reactive Laboratory slot uses a cascade reel mechanic. After a successful cascade win, the winning symbols are removed, and new ones fall down from above, giving you a new opportunity for a win. Cascades continue until a new winning cluster is created. \n\nHelping your chances of winning is the W symbol, the wild. As usual, it substitutes for all standard symbols and can be equipped with multipliers that can increase your winnings by 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x in the base game. In the happy circumstance of landing more than one wild multiplier in the same combination, the amounts are combined for an even greater boost. \n\nThe atom symbol joins the standard symbols and the wild character. This triggers a special reaction when it appears next to the DNA symbol. All symbols on the reel and row where the DNA symbol is located are removed, and a new cascade follows. A DNA reaction also awards a payout equal to your total stake. Expect even more explosive action when the atom lands next to the lightning bolt symbol. Here, all copies of the symbol with the lowest value on the reels are removed, followed by a new cascade. \n\nThe Free Falls function offers 10 or 15 free spins. It's activated by landing 5 or more cascade wins in a single paid game. To get 15 free spins, you'll need to land 7 successive cascade wins. You can keep track of your behaviour through the counter next to the reels. \n\nJust like in the base game, the W symbol that represents the wild comes with multipliers. However, they are larger during free spins and can increase payouts by 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x or 10x. In the base game, the wilds disappear after a successful cascade. This is not the case during the function, however. Instead, they stay in position. Their multiplier decreases by 2x with each game until it reaches a minimum of 2x. Only then do they disappear from the grid. \n\nAs part of the Mega Drop mechanism, you have the chance to land one of the Minor, Major or Epic Jackpots. The latter offers prizes of up to 200,000 euros if you're lucky. \n\nSimilar Slots \nThe Cluster Pays mechanism always reminds us of NetEnt's Aloha! Cluster Pays slot machine. This was the first game with this game mechanic. If you haven't tried this game yet, you have to play it. It has a fun tiki theme with Sticky Respins and free spins. It may seem like a very different game, but there are definitely many similarities to be found with the Dr Reactive's Laboratory online slot.\n            ",

To create a winning combination, land clusters of 5 or more matching symbols that can be formed vertically and/or horizontally. After every successful cascade win, the winning symbols disappear, and new ones fall down from above, giving you a new opportunity for a win. Cascades continue until a new winning cluster is created. \n\nSymbols and paylines\n\nThere are no traditional paylines in Dr Reactive's Laboratory. Instead, you must land a cluster of 5 or more matching symbols to create a winning combination. Symbols include green, purple, pink, and orange vials, a lightning bolt, and a DNA strand. The standard wild symbol, represented by the letter W, substitutes all other symbols and can be equipped with multipliers that can increase your winnings by 2x, 3x, 4x or 5x in the base game. \n\nProgressive jackpots\n\nDr Reactive's Laboratory offers three progressive jackpots to win as part of the Mega Drop mechanism - Minor, Major and Epic Jackpots. The Epic Jackpot offers the highest prize of up to 200,000 euros if you are lucky. \n\nFree spin feature\n\nThe free spins feature is triggered by landing at least 5 successive cascade wins in a single paid game. With 5 cascade wins, you get 10 free spins, while landing 7 cascade wins earns you 15 free spins. During free spins, wild multipliers increase to up to 10x, but decrease by 2x each game until they reach a minimum of 2x. The wilds stay in position during this feature until their multiplier decreases to 2x. \n\nSymbol multipliers\n\nThe standard wild symbol in Dr Reactive's Laboratory substitutes all other symbols and can be equipped with multipliers of up to 5x in the base game. During free spins, the wild multipliers increase to up to 10x, but decrease by 2x each game until they reach a minimum of 2x. If you land more than one wild multiplier in the same combination, the amounts are combined for an even greater boost. \n\nTheme and design\n\nDr Reactive's Laboratory is a retro cartoon-style online slot, developed by Red 7, with an unusual chemistry lab theme. The reels are set against a mysterious machine, and the symbols include various coloured vials, a lightning bolt, and a DNA strand. The slot also features an atom complete with electrons that acts as a scatter to trigger two unique bonus features. \n\nOverall experience\n\nDr Reactive's Laboratory is an explosive online slot game that can provide players with decent payouts due to the cluster pay mechanic and the cascade reels. The addition of wild multipliers and free spins feature offers more chances to win big. The game has a fun retro cartoon-style theme and the Mega Drop Jackpot feature offers players the opportunity to win a huge prize. Overall, this is a fun and entertaining slot game that is worth checking out. \n\n        \n            ",

This game is one we are not neutral about as we believe that the chemistry between you and this slot will be explosive! With cascade reels and the cluster pay mechanic, you are given more chances to win big in this retro cartoon-style slot. The epic 8×8 reels provide you with plenty of symbols to play with, as you hunt to collect those that pay out the important clusters. With wild multipliers, free spins, and three progressive jackpots to win, this slot is a chemistry lesson you won't want to skip.\n\nImagine entering Dr Reactive's Laboratory, the unusual 8-reel cluster pay game from WMS and Red 7, where your goal is to concoct explosive chemical cocktails. Land clusters of 5 or matching symbols to create a winning combination that triggers a cascade. Land special symbol combinations to clear reels, rows, and low value symbols. Trigger the free spins feature by landing at least 5 successive cascade wins. Here, wild multipliers can send payouts rocketing up to 10x. Enter the laboratory for bets from 20 cents up to 100 euros per spin. \n\nReleased by the innovative casino game developer Red7, the reels of Dr Reactive's Laboratory are set against a mysterious machine. Symbols include green, purple, pink, and orange vials, a lightning bolt, and a DNA strand. You will also notice a letter W in glowing, radioactive style, which acts as the wild, and an atom complete with electrons that acts as a scatter to trigger two unique bonus features. \n\nThere are no traditional paylines in Dr Reactive's Laboratory. To create a winning combination, you must land a cluster of 5 or more matching symbols. These can be formed vertically and/or horizontally. The more symbols in the cluster, the greater the potential reward. If you find 15 DNA symbols in a cluster, you will be awarded a prize equal to 50 times your total bet. \n\nThe Dr Reactive Laboratory slot uses a cascade reel mechanic. After a successful cascade win, the winning symbols are removed, and new ones fall down from above, giving you a new opportunity for a win. Cascades continue until a new winning cluster is created. \n\nHelping your chances of winning is the W symbol, the wild. As usual, it substitutes for all standard symbols and can be equipped with multipliers that can increase your winnings by 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x in the base game. In the happy circumstance of landing more than one wild multiplier in the same combination, the amounts are combined for an even greater boost. \n\nThe atom symbol joins the standard symbols and the wild character. This triggers a special reaction when it appears next to the DNA symbol. All symbols on the reel and row where the DNA symbol is located are removed, and a new cascade follows. A DNA reaction also awards a payout equal to your total stake. Expect even more explosive action when the atom lands next to the lightning bolt symbol. Here, all copies of the symbol with the lowest value on the reels are removed, followed by a new cascade. \n\nThe Free Falls function offers 10 or 15 free spins. It's activated by landing 5 or more cascade wins in a single paid game. To get 15 free spins, you'll need to land 7 successive cascade wins. You can keep track of your behaviour through the counter next to the reels. \n\nJust like in the base game, the W symbol that represents the wild comes with multipliers. However, they are larger during free spins and can increase payouts by 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x or 10x. In the base game, the wilds disappear after a successful cascade.

This game is one we are not neutral about as we believe that the chemistry between you and this slot will be explosive! With cascade reels and the cluster pay mechanic, you are given more chances to win big in this retro cartoon-style slot. The epic 8×8 reels provide you with plenty of symbols to play with, as you hunt to collect those that pay out the important clusters. With wild multipliers, free spins, and three progressive jackpots to win, this slot is a chemistry lesson you won't want to skip.\n\nImagine entering Dr Reactive's Laboratory, the unusual 8-reel cluster pay game from WMS and Red 7, where your goal is to concoct explosive chemical cocktails. Land clusters of 5 or matching symbols to create a winning combination that triggers a cascade. Land special symbol combinations to clear reels, rows, and low value symbols. Trigger the free spins feature by landing at least 5 successive cascade wins. Here, wild multipliers can send payouts rocketing up to 10x. Enter the laboratory for bets from 20 cents up to 100 euros per spin. \n\nReleased by the innovative casino game developer Red7, the reels of Dr Reactive's Laboratory are set against a mysterious machine. Symbols include green, purple, pink, and orange vials, a lightning bolt, and a DNA strand. You will also notice a letter W in glowing, radioactive style, which acts as the wild, and an atom complete with electrons that acts as a scatter to trigger two unique bonus features. \n\nThere are no traditional paylines in Dr Reactive's Laboratory. To create a winning combination, you must land a cluster of 5 or more matching symbols. These can be formed vertically and/or horizontally. The more symbols in the cluster, the greater the potential reward. If you find 15 DNA symbols in a cluster, you will be awarded a prize equal to 50 times your total bet. \n\nThe Dr Reactive Laboratory slot uses a cascade reel mechanic. After a successful cascade win, the winning symbols are removed, and new ones fall down from above, giving you a new opportunity for a win. Cascades continue until a new winning cluster is created. \n\nHelping your chances of winning is the W symbol, the wild. As usual, it substitutes for all standard symbols and can be equipped with multipliers that can increase your winnings by 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x in the base game. In the happy circumstance of landing more than one wild multiplier in the same combination, the amounts are combined for an even greater boost. \n\nThe atom symbol joins the standard symbols and the wild character. This triggers a special reaction when it appears next to the DNA symbol. All symbols on the reel and row where the DNA symbol is located are removed, and a new cascade follows. A DNA reaction also awards a payout equal to your total stake. Expect even more explosive action when the atom lands next to the lightning bolt symbol. Here, all copies of the symbol with the lowest value on the reels are removed, followed by a new cascade. \n\nThe Free Falls function offers 10 or 15 free spins. It's activated by landing 5 or more cascade wins in a single paid game. To get 15 free spins, you'll need to land 7 successive cascade wins. You can keep track of your behaviour through the counter next to the reels. \n\nJust like in the base game, the W symbol that represents the wild comes with multipliers. However, they are larger during free spins and can increase payouts by 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x or 10x. In the base game, the wilds disappear after a successful cascade. This is not the case during the function, however. Instead, they stay in position. Their multiplier decreases by 2x with each game until it reaches a minimum of 2x. Only then do they disappear from the grid. \n\nAs part of the Mega Drop mechanism, you have the chance to land one of the Minor, Major or Epic Jackpots. The latter offers prizes of up to 200,000 euros if you're lucky. \n\nSimilar Slots \nThe Cluster Pays mechanism always reminds us of NetEnt's Aloha! Cluster Pays slot machine. This was the first game with this game mechanic. If you haven't tried this game yet, you have to play it. It has a fun tiki theme with Sticky Respins and free spins. It may seem like a very different game, but there are definitely many similarities to be found with the Dr Reactive's Laboratory online slot.\n            ",
