Si tratta di un gioco a tema africano, non particolarmente originale ma ben realizzato e con alcune caratteristiche che lo rendono apprezzabile e coinvolgente.\nPer quanto riguarda il compartimento grafico, African Quest sviluppa al meglio la tematica safari con un mix di simboli che abbiamo visto spesso in passato: alberi africani, elefanti, giraffe, zebre, rinoceronti e mappe dell’Africa si alternano sui rulli, accanto alle lettere e ai numeri che si riferiscono alle carte da gioco, riprodotte seguendo la grafica del tema.\nIl range di scommesse di questa slot machine non è molto ampio, si possono infatti effettuare le proprie puntate a partire da 10 centesimi fino a 15 €, una cifra abbastanza bassa che ci farebbe pensare a premi ugualmente di scarso valore. In realtà, nonostante questo intervallo ristretto di puntate, African Quest è un gioco caratterizzato da un’alta volatilità (cosa peraltro non consueta per le slot machine di casa Microgaming), il che significa che sebbene le vincite non siano così frequenti si potranno portare a casa delle discrete somme, come per esempio la vincita massima pari a 84.000 € (ben 5.600 volte il valore della puntata).\nL’RTP (il ritorno teorico al giocatore) non è sbalorditivo ma si attesta su un abbastanza canonico 96,52%.\nCaratteristiche principali del gameplay\nIl gameplay di African Quest non risulta essere molto articolato, anche se sono presenti delle funzioni speciali che lo arricchiscono, rendendo l’esperienza di gioco più coinvolgente e le vincite più gratificanti.\nLa prima funzione speciale che citiamo è quella che riteniamo più interessante, ossia la Hyperspin Feature: si tratta della possibilità di far girare nuovamente un rullo (a pagamento), per aumentare le chance di ottenere delle combinazioni vincenti.\nLa seconda special Feature è quella legata al simbolo Scatter, rappresentato dalla mappa dell’Africa, che a seconda del numero di volte in cui compare sui rulli (tre, quattro o cinque), regala un numero variabile di giri gratuiti e moltiplicatori a scelta del giocatore, secondo il seguente schema:\n\nScelta 1: 5, 10 oppure 15 giri gratuiti con moltiplicatore x3 o x4\nScelta 2: 8, 15 o 20 giri gratuiti con moltiplicatore x3 o x4\nScelta 3: 12, 25 o 40 giri gratuiti con moltiplicatore massimo x 2\n\nDurante i giri gratuiti il valore massimo del moltiplicatore può poi aumentare, raggiungendo il valore di 64 volte la puntata e offrendo la possibilità di accedere al premio di 84.000 €\nAfrican Quest: conclusioni\nAfrican Quest è una slot machine ben lontana dall’originalità, non mancando nei cataloghi di praticamente tutte le software house dei giochi a tema Africa; nonostante ciò può rappresentare un’attrattiva per coloro che amano la funzione Hyperspin. Oltre a questo, il gameplay è abbastanza facile e intuitivo e ciò rende African Quest una slot machine adatta anche ai principianti, sebbene debba essere messo in conto che non sarà così semplice vincere in virtù dell’elevata volatilità.\n",

It's an African-themed game, not particularly original but well executed and with some features that make it enjoyable and engaging.\nIn terms of graphics, African Quest develops the safari theme to perfection with a mix of symbols that we've seen often in the past: African trees, elephants, giraffes, zebras, rhinoceroses, and Africa maps alternate on the reels, alongside letters and numbers which are reproduced following the theme's graphics.\nThe betting range of this slot machine is not very wide. Players can place their bets starting from 10 cents up to € 15, a relatively low amount that would make us think of prizes of equal value. In reality, despite this restricted range of bets, African Quest is a game characterized by high volatility (which is not typical for Microgaming slots), which means that even though the winnings are not frequent, one can still bring home substantial amounts, like the maximum win of € 84,000 (5,600 times the value of the bet).\nThe RTP (theoretical return to player) is not staggering but is still relatively standard at 96.52%.\nMain Gameplay Features\nThe gameplay of African Quest is not highly complicated, although there are special features that enrich it, making the gaming experience more engaging and the wins more rewarding.\nThe first special function we'll mention is the most interesting one, the Hyperspin Feature. This refers to the possibility of re-spinning a reel (for a fee), to increase the chances of getting winning combinations.\nThe second special feature is related to the Scatter symbol, represented by the Africa map, which, depending on the number of times it appears on the reels (three, four or five), rewards players with a variable number of free spins and multipliers chosen by the player following the following scheme:\n\nChoice 1: 5, 10 or 15 free spins with a 3x or 4x multiplier\nChoice 2: 8, 15 or 20 free spins with a 3x or 4x multiplier\nChoice 3: 12, 25 or 40 free spins with a maximum 2x multiplier\n\nDuring free spins, the maximum value of the multiplier can increase, reaching 64 times the bet value, offering the chance to access the € 84,000 prize.\nConclusion\nAfrican Quest is a slot machine far from originality, as practically every software house offers Africa-themed games in their catalogs.

So, if you're a high-risk taker, the African Quest slot game is perfect for you.</p>\n\n    <p>As for the theme of the game, African Quest takes you on a safari adventure in the savannas of Africa. The game's graphics and sound effects can transport you to the heart of the jungle. But, let's be real, the 'safari' theme is quite generic. We've seen it all before, and it may not be for everyone. But hey, if you can't go on a real safari, why not go on an African Quest? </p>\n\n    <p>All in all, this slot game is geared towards adventure seekers who enjoy a challenge and are not afraid to take risks. If you're a fan of African-themed games or you're just looking for something new, African Quest is definitely worth a try. Who knows, you could be the next big winner!</p>\"\n}"

The Hyperspin Feature allows you to spin a reel again (for a fee) to increase your chances of getting winning combinations. The Scatter symbol, represented by the map of Africa, triggers free spins and multipliers according to the number of times it appears on the reels. Free spins can be chosen by the player, and the maximum value of the multiplier can increase up to 64 times the bet, offering an opportunity to win the €84,000 prize.\n\nPotential winnings\n\nAfrican Quest is a high-volatility game that may not award frequent wins but offers decent sums in the long run. The maximum win is €84,000 or 5,600 times the value of the bet, which is not bad for a low betting range that starts from 10 cents and goes up to 15 €.\n\nDesign and theme\n\nAfrican Quest has an African-themed design with well-executed graphics that effectively develop the safari atmosphere. The symbols on the reels include African trees, elephants, giraffes, zebras, rhinos, and African maps, alongside letters and numbers referring to playing cards, all following the graphics of the theme.\n\nBet range\n\nThe range of bets for African Quest is not very wide and ranges from 10 cents to 15 €. Despite this low amount, the game is characterized by high volatility, which means that players can still take home decent sums, especially considering the maximum win of €84,000 (5,600 times the value of the bet).\n\nRTP\n\nAfrican Quest has a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.52%, which is standard for most slot machines. While it is not a remarkable value, it is still a fair rate that can provide players with some decent winnings.\n\n        \n            ",

It features 5 reels and 1024 paylines, and the minimum bet is €0.10 while the maximum is €15. The game has an RTP of 96.52% and high volatility with a maximum win of €84,000 (5,600 times the value of the bet).\n\nGame Design and Symbols\n\nAfrican Quest offers a well-executed safari theme with symbols like elephants, giraffes, zebras, rhinos, and African maps. It also features card symbols represented with graphics that align with the theme of the game.\n\nWinning Potential and Volatility\n\nDespite having a minimum bet of €0.10, African Quest has high volatility, which means that winnings are not frequent, but the payouts can be quite substantial. The maximum win is €84,000, which is 5,600 times the value of the bet. While the RTP is 96.52%, which is within the standard range, it is still not remarkable.\n\nSpecial Features: Hyperspin and Scatter\n\nOne of the special features of African Quest is the Hyperspin feature, which allows players to spin a reel (for a fee) again, increasing their chances of getting a winning combination. The second special feature is the Scatter symbol represented by the map of Africa. Depending on how many times it appears on the reels, players can choose from different options to get a varying number of free spins and multipliers, with the possibility of winning up to 64 times the bet.\n\nOverall Appeal and Target Audience\n\nAfrican Quest's gameplay is easy and intuitive, making it suitable for beginners, but the high volatility makes it a challenge for those who are looking for more frequent wins. The Hyperspin feature can attract those who enjoy taking risks and want to increase their chances of winning. Overall, African Quest's generic safari theme may not be appealing to everyone, but it can be an interesting choice for the fans of African-themed slot games.\n\n        \n            ",

It is an African-themed game, not particularly original but well-executed and with some features that make it enjoyable and engaging.\n\nRegarding the graphics, African Quest develops the safari theme perfectly with a mix of symbols that we have often seen in the past: African trees, elephants, giraffes, zebras, rhinos, and African maps alternate on the reels, alongside letters and numbers referring to playing cards, reproduced following the graphics of the theme.\n\nThe range of bets for this slot machine is not very wide. You can place your bets starting from 10 cents up to 15 €. It seems like a low amount of money for valuable prizes. Still, in reality, despite this restricted range of bets, African Quest is a game characterized by high volatility (which is not usual for Microgaming slot machines), which means that although winnings are not so frequent, you can take home decent sums, like the maximum win of €84,000 (5,600 times the value of the bet).\n\nThe RTP (theoretical return to the player) is not amazing but remains at a rather standard 96.52%.\n\nMain gameplay features\nAfrican Quest's gameplay is not very complicated, although some special functions enrich it, making the gaming experience more engaging and the winnings more rewarding.\n\nThe first special function we mention is the most interesting one, namely the Hyperspin Feature: It allows you to spin a reel again (for a fee) to increase your chances of getting winning combinations.\n\nThe second special feature is related to the Scatter symbol, represented by the map of Africa, which, depending on the number of times it appears on the reels (three, four, or five), gives a variable number of free spins and multipliers chosen by the player, according to the following scheme:\n\nChoice 1: 5, 10, or 15 free spins with a multiplier of x3 or x4\nChoice 2: 8, 15, or 20 free spins with a multiplier of x3 or x4\nChoice 3: 12, 25, or 40 free spins with a maximum multiplier of x2\n\nDuring free spins, the maximum value of the multiplier can increase, reaching the value of 64 times the bet, offering an opportunity to win the €84,000 prize.\n\nAfrican Quest: Conclusions\nAfrican Quest is a slot machine far from originality, as it is present in the catalogs of practically all software houses of Africa-themed games. However, it can represent an attraction for those who love the Hyperspin function. In addition, the gameplay is quite easy and intuitive, making African Quest suitable also for beginners, although it should be taken into account that winning due to the high volatility will not be so simple.\n            ",

It is an African-themed game, not particularly original but well-executed and with some features that make it enjoyable and engaging.\n\nRegarding the graphics, African Quest develops the safari theme perfectly with a mix of symbols that we have often seen in the past: African trees, elephants, giraffes, zebras, rhinos, and African maps alternate on the reels, alongside letters and numbers referring to playing cards, reproduced following the graphics of the theme.\n\nThe range of bets for this slot machine is not very wide. You can place your bets starting from 10 cents up to 15 €. It seems like a low amount of money for valuable prizes. Still, in reality, despite this restricted range of bets, African Quest is a game characterized by high volatility (which is not usual for Microgaming slot machines), which means that although winnings are not so frequent, you can take home decent sums, like the maximum win of €84,000 (5,600 times the value of the bet).\n\nThe RTP (theoretical return to the player) is not amazing but remains at a rather standard 96.52%.\n\nMain gameplay features\nAfrican Quest's gameplay is not very complicated, although some special functions enrich it, making the gaming experience more engaging and the winnings more rewarding.\n\nThe first special function we mention is the most interesting one, namely the Hyperspin Feature: It allows you to spin a reel again (for a fee) to increase your chances of getting winning combinations.\n\nThe second special feature is related to the Scatter symbol, represented by the map of Africa, which, depending on the number of times it appears on the reels (three, four, or five), gives a variable number of free spins and multipliers chosen by the player, according to the following scheme:\n\nChoice 1: 5, 10, or 15 free spins with a multiplier of x3 or x4\nChoice 2: 8, 15, or 20 free spins with a multiplier of x3 or x4\nChoice 3: 12, 25, or 40 free spins with a maximum multiplier of x2\n\nDuring free spins, the maximum value of the multiplier can increase, reaching the value of 64 times the bet, offering an opportunity to win the €84,000 prize.\n\nAfrican Quest: Conclusions\nAfrican Quest is a slot machine far from originality, as it is present in the catalogs of practically all software houses of Africa-themed games. However, it can represent an attraction for those who love the Hyperspin function. In addition, the gameplay is quite easy and intuitive, making African Quest suitable also for beginners, although it should be taken into account that winning due to the high volatility will not be so simple.\n            ",
