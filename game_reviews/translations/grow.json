Una volta attivato, si ricomincia da capo;\nSimbolo Bonus Misterioso: Vedrai anche un punto interrogativo che è il simbolo del mistero. All’inizio di ogni giro, i simboli misteriosi possono essere sostituiti casualmente con 1 degli altri simboli. Questa è chiamata la funzione Simbolo Mistero.\n\nNota Bene! Se la pianta di fagioli cresce più di 10 volte, la crescita extra viene aggiunta alla piantina successiva. Il premio in denaro negli scrigni è unico e cambia mentre giri le ruote.

La varianza di vincita infatti non è altissima: puoi vincere un massimo di 150 volte la puntata se riempi tutte le posizioni della bobina con i simboli della carriola e 200 volte la scommessa se riesci a riempire i rulli con jolly. Le vincite più consistenti arriveranno dalla funzione Tesoro di Fagiolo Magico in cui i premi in denaro possono raggiungere 5.000 volte la giocata iniziale.

With 10 reels of fruity symbols, this green-themed game will take you to new heights through the magic of bean plants, unlocking 4 chests containing precious treasures. Are you ready to put on your gloves and get some gardening done? If the answer is yes, keep reading here...\n\nHow is the gameplay of G.R.O.W set up?\nYou can play this slot without registration in both horizontal and vertical mode, the latter being more practical. With 5 reels and 50 paylines, this gardening-themed online slot can be played from 0.50 cents up to 200 euros per spin on desktop, mobile and tablet devices. By growing mysterious symbols, magic beans, you will receive cash prizes and free spins. With an RTP of 96.47%, G.R.O.W is a moderately profitable slot if you also accumulate the chest prizes.\n\nWhat are the main vegetable symbols?\nThe screen is animated with a series of colorful symbols that include:\n\nStrawberries, broccoli, beans and turnips of low value\nShovels, gardening gloves, sprayers and high-value wheelbarrows. The latter pays 0.8, 1.4 or 3 times the bet for 3, 4 or 5 in combination.\nThere is also a Wild Pepper symbol that replaces all symbols except the Bonus Scatter, Golden Bee and G.R.O.W symbols. 3, 4 or 5 of them on a payline will pay you 1, 1.6 or 4 times your bet, respectively. Winning combinations are formed by getting 3 or more corresponding symbols from left to right starting from reel 1.\n\nHow many bonus features are present in the game?\nThere are a total of 4:\n\nGolden Bee symbol - when one or more Golden Bee symbols land on the reels, additional cash amounts will be added to the corresponding chest. If the bee lands on reels 1 and 5, the prize will increase either on the first or last chest;\nG.R.O.W and the Magic Bean Treasure - when this symbol lands on the reels, both during the base game and during free spins, fertilizer will make the bean plant grow, leaving a trail behind on the reels. Each reel will have a specific magic bean, and when you grow it up to 10 times, a chest will open.\nThe 4 chests - each chest hides a cash value. This is calculated based on your current bet and the average of all bets, in addition to any amount assigned by Golden Bee symbols. Once activated, it starts over;\nMystery Bonus Symbol: You will also see a question mark, which is the symbol of the mystery. At the beginning of each spin, mystery symbols can randomly be replaced with one of the other symbols. This is called the Mystery Symbol function.\n\nNote! If the bean plant grows more than 10 times, the extra growth is added to the next plant. The cash prize in the chests is unique and changes as you spin the reels. It is calculated based on your average bet for that chest - even Golden Bee symbols increase the value by 2 times the bet.\n\nHow do you win at G.R.O.W slot?\nTo grow the bean plants, you must land the G.R.O.W scatter symbols on the reels - if a G.R.O.W symbol lands on reel 1, the sprout on reel 1 will begin to grow, and so on. If the G.R.O.W symbol is on reels 2, 3 or 4, it increases the height of the adjacent bean stalks. In addition, the Golden Bee and G.R.O.W icons act as wild symbols. Once you have reached optimal plant maturity, you can get big final wins and reap the fruits of your hard work!\n\nWhat is the trend of Free Spins in G.R.O.W?\nThe slot features a Free Spins function - this is played when you get 3 or more bonus symbols on the reels. You will then receive 10 free spins. Landing 3 bonus symbols in the function will reward you with an additional 10 free spins - in the function, they only appear on odd reels 1, 3 and 5.\n\nMy final opinion on G.R.O.W.\nThis game seems more suitable for amateur players than for veteran slot machine players who populate our AAMS/ADM casinos. The variance in winnings is not very high: you can win a maximum of 150 times your bet if you fill all reel positions with the wheelbarrow symbols, and 200 times the bet if you manage to fill the reels with wilds. The most substantial wins will come from the Magic Bean Treasure function, where cash prizes can reach 5,000 times the initial bet. If you love cartoon-themed slots, we recommend trying the free Honey Rush slot by Play'n Go, which has similar themes but more interesting wins or one of the many new titles just reviewed for you on Slotjava!",

Se l’ape atterra sui rulli 1 e 5, aumenterà il premio rispettivamente sul primo o sull’ultimo scrigno;\nG.R.O.W e il Tesoro del Fagiolo Magico – quando questo simbolo atterra sui rulli, sia durante il gioco base che durante i giri gratuiti, il fertilizzante farà crescere la pianta di fagioli, lasciando dietro di sé la scia sui rulli. Ogni bobina avrà un fagiolo magico specifico, e quando lo farai crescere fino a 10 volte, si aprirà una cassa.\nI 4 forzieri – ogni forziere nasconde un valore in denaro. Questo viene calcolato in base alla tua puntata attuale e alla media delle scommesse, oltre a qualsiasi importo assegnato dai simboli delle api d’oro. Una volta attivato, si ricomincia da capo;\nSimbolo Bonus Misterioso: Vedrai anche un punto interrogativo che è il simbolo del mistero. All’inizio di ogni giro, i simboli misteriosi possono essere sostituiti casualmente con 1 degli altri simboli. Questa è chiamata la funzione Simbolo Mistero.\n\nNota Bene! Se la pianta di fagioli cresce più di 10 volte, la crescita extra viene aggiunta alla piantina successiva. Il premio in denaro negli scrigni è unico e cambia mentre giri le ruote. Esso viene calcolato in base alla media delle tue puntate per quel forziere – anche i simboli dell’Ape d’Oro aumentano il valore di 2 volte la puntata.\nCome si vince alla slot G.R.O.W?\nPer far crescere le piantine di fagioli, devi far atterrare i simboli scatter G.R.O.W sui rulli – se un simbolo G.R.O.W dovesse atterrare sui rulli 1, il germoglio sul rullo 1 comincerà a crescere, e così via. Se il simbolo G.R.O.W si trova sui rulli 2, 3 o 4, aumenta l’altezza dei fagiolini adiacenti ad esso. Inoltre, le icone Ape d’Oro e G.R.O.W fungono da simboli jolly. Una volta raggiunta la maturazione ottimale delle piantine, potrai ottenere grandi vincite finali e raccogliere i frutti di tanto lavoro!\nQual è l’andamento dei Giri Gratuiti in G.R.O.W?\nLa slot è dotata di una funzione Free Spins – questa viene giocata quando ottieni 3 o più simboli bonus sui rulli. Riceverai quindi 10 giri gratuiti. L’atterraggio di 3 simboli bonus nella funzione ti ricompenserà con 10 giri gratuiti aggiuntivi: nella funzione, appaiono solo sui rulli dispari 1, 3 e 5.\nLa mia opinione finale su G.R.O.W.\nQuesto gioco mi sembra più adatto ai giocatori amatoriali che ai veterani delle slot machine che popolano i nostri casinò AAMS/ADM. La varianza di vincita infatti non è altissima: puoi vincere un massimo di 150 volte la puntata se riempi tutte le posizioni della bobina con i simboli della carriola e 200 volte la scommessa se riesci a riempire i rulli con jolly. Le vincite più consistenti arriveranno dalla funzione Tesoro di Fagiolo Magico in cui i premi in denaro possono raggiungere 5.000 volte la giocata iniziale. Se ami le slot a tema cartoon ti consiglio di provare la slot gratis Honey Rush di Play’n Go, che ha temi simili ma vincite più interessanti o uno dei tanti nuovi titoli appena recensiti per te su Slotjava!\n\n        ",

With cartoonish graphics and a rustic setting that brings the background to life, you can grow your garden next to the charming wooden house and become a pro gardener! With 10 rows of fruit symbols, this green-themed game will make you reach for the sky by reaching for 4 chests containing precious treasures through magic bean plants. Are you ready to put on your gloves and do some gardening? If the answer is yes, read on...\n\nHow is the gameplay organized in G.R.O.W?\n\nYou can play this slot without registration in both horizontal and vertical mode, perhaps more practical. With 5 reels and 50 paylines, this online gardening-themed slot can be played from 0.50 cents up to 200 euros per spin on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. Through the growth of mysterious symbols, magic beans, you will receive cash prizes and free spins. With an RTP of 96.47%, G.R.O.W is a medium-paying slot if you also accumulate chest prizes.\n\nWhat are the main plant symbols?\n\nThe screen is animated by a series of multicolored symbols including:\n\nLow-value strawberries, broccoli, beans, and turnips\nHigh-value trowels, gardening gloves, spray misters, and wheelbarrows. The latter pays out 0.8, 1.4, or 3 times the bet for 3, 4 or 5 in combination.\nThere is also a Wild Chili Pepper that replaces all symbols except Bonus scatter symbols, Golden Bee and G.R.O.W. 3, 4, or 5 of them on a payline will pay out 1, 1.6, or 4 times the bet respectively. Winning combinations are formed by getting 3 or more matching symbols from left to right starting from reel 1.\n\nHow many Bonus Features are present in the game?\n\nThere are 4 in total:\n\nGolden Bee Symbol - when one or more Golden Bee symbols land on the reels, an additional cash amount will be added to the corresponding chest. If the bee lands on reels 1 and 5, the prize on the first or last chest respectively will increase.\nG.R.O.W and the Treasure of the Magic Bean - when this symbol lands on the reels, both during the base game and during free spins, fertilizer will grow the bean plant, leaving a trail behind on the reels. Each reel will have a specific magic bean, and when you grow it up to 10 times, a chest will open.\nThe 4 chests - each chest hides a cash value. This is calculated based on your current bet and the average of all bets, plus any amount awarded by the Golden Bee symbols. Once activated, you start over again.\nMystery Bonus Symbol: You'll also see a question mark which is the Mystery symbol. At the start of each spin, mystery symbols can be randomly replaced with 1 of the other symbols. This is called the Mystery Symbol feature.\n\nNote! If the bean plant grows more than 10 times, the extra growth is added to the next plant. The cash prize in the chests is unique and changes as you spin the reels. It is calculated based on the average of your bets for that chest - even Golden Bee symbols increase the value by 2 times the bet.\n\nHow do you win in the G.R.O.W slot?\n\nTo grow the bean plants, you need to land the G.R.O.W scatter symbols on the reels - if a G.R.O.W symbol lands on reel 1, the sprout on it will start to grow, and so on. If the G.R.O.W symbol is on reels 2, 3 or 4, it raises the height of adjacent bean sprouts. In addition, the Golden Bee and G.R.O.W icons act as wild symbols. Once the plants reach optimal maturity, you can get big final rewards and reap the fruits of your labor!\n\nWhat is the trend of Free Spins in G.R.O.W?\n\nThe slot comes with a Free Spins feature - this is played when you get 3 or more bonus symbols on the reels. You will then receive 10 free spins. Landing 3 bonus symbols in the feature will reward you with an additional 10 free spins - they only appear on odd reels 1, 3, and 5 in the feature.\n\nMy final opinion on G.R.O.W.\n\nThis game seems more suited to amateur players than to veterans of slot machines that populate our AAMS/ADM casinos. The variance of winning is not very high: you can win a maximum of 150 times the bet if you fill all positions on the reel with wheelbarrow symbols and 200 times the bet if you manage to fill the reels with wild symbols. The most substantial rewards will come from the Magic Bean Treasure function, where cash prizes can reach 5,000 times the initial bet. If you love cartoon-themed slots, I recommend trying the free slot Honey Rush from Play'n Go, which has similar themes but more interesting rewards or one of the many new titles just reviewed for you on Slotjava!"

With a fun cartoon graphics and rustic background, you can grow your own garden next to the delightful wooden cottage and become a skilled gardener. With 10 reels of fruity symbols, this green-themed game will take you to new heights through the magic of bean plants, unlocking 4 chests containing precious treasures. Are you ready to put on your gloves and get some gardening done? If the answer is yes, keep reading here...\n\nHow is the gameplay of G.R.O.W set up?\nYou can play this slot without registration in both horizontal and vertical mode, the latter being more practical. With 5 reels and 50 paylines, this gardening-themed online slot can be played from 0.50 cents up to 200 euros per spin on desktop, mobile and tablet devices. By growing mysterious symbols, magic beans, you will receive cash prizes and free spins. With an RTP of 96.47%, G.R.O.W is a moderately profitable slot if you also accumulate the chest prizes.\n\nWhat are the main vegetable symbols?\nThe screen is animated with a series of colorful symbols that include:\n\nStrawberries, broccoli, beans and turnips of low value\nShovels, gardening gloves, sprayers and high-value wheelbarrows. The latter pays 0.8, 1.4 or 3 times the bet for 3, 4 or 5 in combination.\nThere is also a Wild Pepper symbol that replaces all symbols except the Bonus Scatter, Golden Bee and G.R.O.W symbols. 3, 4 or 5 of them on a payline will pay you 1, 1.6 or 4 times your bet, respectively. Winning combinations are formed by getting 3 or more corresponding symbols from left to right starting from reel 1.\n\nHow many bonus features are present in the game?\nThere are a total of 4:\n\nGolden Bee symbol - when one or more Golden Bee symbols land on the reels, additional cash amounts will be added to the corresponding chest. If the bee lands on reels 1 and 5, the prize will increase either on the first or last chest;\nG.R.O.W and the Magic Bean Treasure - when this symbol lands on the reels, both during the base game and during free spins, fertilizer will make the bean plant grow, leaving a trail behind on the reels. Each reel will have a specific magic bean, and when you grow it up to 10 times, a chest will open.\nThe 4 chests - each chest hides a cash value. This is calculated based on your current bet and the average of all bets, in addition to any amount assigned by Golden Bee symbols. Once activated, it starts over;\nMystery Bonus Symbol: You will also see a question mark, which is the symbol of the mystery. At the beginning of each spin, mystery symbols can randomly be replaced with one of the other symbols. This is called the Mystery Symbol function.\n\nNote! If the bean plant grows more than 10 times, the extra growth is added to the next plant. The cash prize in the chests is unique and changes as you spin the reels. It is calculated based on your average bet for that chest - even Golden Bee symbols increase the value by 2 times the bet.\n\nHow do you win at G.R.O.W slot?\nTo grow the bean plants, you must land the G.R.O.W scatter symbols on the reels - if a G.R.O.W symbol lands on reel 1, the sprout on reel 1 will begin to grow, and so on. If the G.R.O.W symbol is on reels 2, 3 or 4, it increases the height of the adjacent bean stalks. In addition, the Golden Bee and G.R.O.W icons act as wild symbols. Once you have reached optimal plant maturity, you can get big final wins and reap the fruits of your hard work!\n\nWhat is the trend of Free Spins in G.R.O.W?\nThe slot features a Free Spins function - this is played when you get 3 or more bonus symbols on the reels. You will then receive 10 free spins. Landing 3 bonus symbols in the function will reward you with an additional 10 free spins - in the function, they only appear on odd reels 1, 3 and 5.\n\nMy final opinion on G.R.O.W.\nThis game seems more suitable for amateur players than for veteran slot machine players who populate our AAMS/ADM casinos. The variance in winnings is not very high: you can win a maximum of 150 times your bet if you fill all reel positions with the wheelbarrow symbols, and 200 times the bet if you manage to fill the reels with wilds. The most substantial wins will come from the Magic Bean Treasure function, where cash prizes can reach 5,000 times the initial bet. If you love cartoon-themed slots, we recommend trying the free Honey Rush slot by Play'n Go, which has similar themes but more interesting wins or one of the many new titles just reviewed for you on Slotjava!\n            ",

It features 5 reels and 50 paylines that can be played horizontally or vertically. Players can spin for just 0.50 cents up to 200 euros per spin across desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. The objective is to grow magic bean symbols to win cash prizes and free spins. The RTP of the game is 96.47%, making it moderately profitable.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nThe slot is green-themed and features colorful symbols such as strawberries, broccoli, beans, and turnips. It also has shovels, gardening gloves, sprayers, and high-value wheelbarrows. The Wild Pepper symbol replaces all symbols except the Bonus Scatter, Golden Bee, and G.R.O.W symbols. Winning combinations are achieved by landing three or more corresponding symbols from left to right starting from reel 1.\n\nBonus Features\n\nG.R.O.W features four bonus features. The first is the Golden Bee symbol that adds extra cash prizes to the corresponding chest when it lands on reels. The second is the G.R.O.W and Magic Bean Treasure symbol that awards chests hiding cash values, which are calculated based on your current bet and the average of all bets. The third is the Mystery Bonus Symbol that randomly replaces the other symbols. The fourth is the Free Spins function, which is triggered when you land three or more bonus symbols on the reels and rewards you with ten free spins.\n\nRTP and Profitability\n\nThe RTP of G.R.O.W is 96.47%, making it a moderately profitable slot game. The most substantial wins come from the Magic Bean Treasure function, where cash prizes can reach up to 5,000 times the initial bet. However, the game seems more suitable for novice players rather than experienced slot machine players due to the low variance of the winnings.\n\nMobile Compatibility\n\nG.R.O.W works on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices, allowing players to spin from anywhere at any time.\n\nGraphics and Animation\n\nThe game offers fun cartoon graphics and rustic backgrounds that will appeal to anyone who loves gardening. The reels are animated with a series of colorful symbols, and the growing bean plant feature adds a unique touch to the game.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nG.R.O.W is suitable for both novice and experienced slot players who enjoy gardening and cartoon-themed slots. It is a green-themed game with colorful symbols that provide a moderately profitable gaming experience.\n\n        \n            ",

The RTP of G.R.O.W is 96.47%.\n\nBonus features and how to trigger them\n\nThe slot features four bonus functions: Golden Bee, G.R.O.W and the Magic Bean Treasure, the 4 chests, and Mystery Bonus Symbol. The Golden Bee symbol triggers cash amounts added to the corresponding chest. The G.R.O.W and the Magic Bean Treasure symbol is used to grow bean plants, and once you grow each plant up to 10 times, a chest is opened. The 4 chests hide cash values that change with each spin while the Mystery Bonus Symbol randomly replaces mystery symbols with another symbol. The Free Spins feature is triggered when 3 or more bonus symbols appear on the reels, and it awards up to 10 free spins.\n\nWinning potential and payout rates\n\nG.R.O.W is a moderately profitable slot. Players can win a maximum of 150 times their bet if they fill all reel positions with the wheelbarrow symbols, while filling the reels with wilds can win them up to 200 times the bet. The Magic Bean Treasure function offers the most significant wins, with cash prizes reaching up to 5,000 times the initial bet. The RTP rate for G.R.O.W is 96.47%.\n\nCompatibility with different devices\n\nG.R.O.W is compatible with desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.\n\nTheme and aesthetics\n\nG.R.O.W is a fun, green-themed slot that features cartoon graphics and rustic backgrounds.

The slot's fun and green-themed dynamics may appeal to gardening enthusiasts.\n\nOverall verdict and recommendation\n\nOverall, G.R.O.W is an enjoyable online slot that may interest gardening enthusiasts with a penchant for cartoon graphics. The bonus features are exciting and keep players engaged, but the low variance in winnings may not be suited to veteran players.

With a fun cartoon graphics and rustic background, you can grow your own garden next to the delightful wooden cottage and become a skilled gardener. With 10 reels of fruity symbols, this green-themed game will take you to new heights through the magic of bean plants, unlocking 4 chests containing precious treasures. Are you ready to put on your gloves and get some gardening done? If the answer is yes, keep reading here...\n\nHow is the gameplay of G.R.O.W set up?\nYou can play this slot without registration in both horizontal and vertical mode, the latter being more practical. With 5 reels and 50 paylines, this gardening-themed online slot can be played from 0.50 cents up to 200 euros per spin on desktop, mobile and tablet devices. By growing mysterious symbols, magic beans, you will receive cash prizes and free spins. With an RTP of 96.47%, G.R.O.W is a moderately profitable slot if you also accumulate the chest prizes.\n\nWhat are the main vegetable symbols?\nThe screen is animated with a series of colorful symbols that include:\n\nStrawberries, broccoli, beans and turnips of low value\nShovels, gardening gloves, sprayers and high-value wheelbarrows. The latter pays 0.8, 1.4 or 3 times the bet for 3, 4 or 5 in combination.\nThere is also a Wild Pepper symbol that replaces all symbols except the Bonus Scatter, Golden Bee and G.R.O.W symbols. 3, 4 or 5 of them on a payline will pay you 1, 1.6 or 4 times your bet, respectively. Winning combinations are formed by getting 3 or more corresponding symbols from left to right starting from reel 1.\n\nHow many bonus features are present in the game?\nThere are a total of 4:\n\nGolden Bee symbol - when one or more Golden Bee symbols land on the reels, additional cash amounts will be added to the corresponding chest. If the bee lands on reels 1 and 5, the prize will increase either on the first or last chest;\nG.R.O.W and the Magic Bean Treasure - when this symbol lands on the reels, both during the base game and during free spins, fertilizer will make the bean plant grow, leaving a trail behind on the reels. Each reel will have a specific magic bean, and when you grow it up to 10 times, a chest will open.\nThe 4 chests - each chest hides a cash value. This is calculated based on your current bet and the average of all bets, in addition to any amount assigned by Golden Bee symbols. Once activated, it starts over;\nMystery Bonus Symbol: You will also see a question mark, which is the symbol of the mystery. At the beginning of each spin, mystery symbols can randomly be replaced with one of the other symbols. This is called the Mystery Symbol function.\n\nNote! If the bean plant grows more than 10 times, the extra growth is added to the next plant. The cash prize in the chests is unique and changes as you spin the reels. It is calculated based on your average bet for that chest - even Golden Bee symbols increase the value by 2 times the bet.\n\nHow do you win at G.R.O.W slot?\nTo grow the bean plants, you must land the G.R.O.W scatter symbols on the reels - if a G.R.O.W symbol lands on reel 1, the sprout on reel 1 will begin to grow, and so on. If the G.R.O.W symbol is on reels 2, 3 or 4, it increases the height of the adjacent bean stalks. In addition, the Golden Bee and G.R.O.W icons act as wild symbols. Once you have reached optimal plant maturity, you can get big final wins and reap the fruits of your hard work!\n\nWhat is the trend of Free Spins in G.R.O.W?\nThe slot features a Free Spins function - this is played when you get 3 or more bonus symbols on the reels. You will then receive 10 free spins. Landing 3 bonus symbols in the function will reward you with an additional 10 free spins - in the function, they only appear on odd reels 1, 3 and 5.\n\nMy final opinion on G.R.O.W.\nThis game seems more suitable for amateur players than for veteran slot machine players who populate our AAMS/ADM casinos. The variance in winnings is not very high: you can win a maximum of 150 times your bet if you fill all reel positions with the wheelbarrow symbols, and 200 times the bet if you manage to fill the reels with wilds. The most substantial wins will come from the Magic Bean Treasure function, where cash prizes can reach 5,000 times the initial bet. If you love cartoon-themed slots, we recommend trying the free Honey Rush slot by Play'n Go, which has similar themes but more interesting wins or one of the many new titles just reviewed for you on Slotjava!\n            ",

Winning combinations are formed by getting 3 or more corresponding symbols from left to right starting from reel 1.\n\nHow many bonus features are present in the game?\nThere are a total of 4:\n\nGolden Bee symbol - when one or more Golden Bee symbols land on the reels, additional cash amounts will be added to the corresponding chest. If the bee lands on reels 1 and 5, the prize will increase either on the first or last chest;\nG.R.O.W and the Magic Bean Treasure - when this symbol lands on the reels, both during the base game and during free spins, fertilizer will make the bean plant grow, leaving a trail behind on the reels. Each reel will have a specific magic bean, and when you grow it up to 10 times, a chest will open.\nThe 4 chests - each chest hides a cash value. This is calculated based on your current bet and the average of all bets, in addition to any amount assigned by Golden Bee symbols. Once activated, it starts over;\nMystery Bonus Symbol: You will also see a question mark, which is the symbol of the mystery. At the beginning of each spin, mystery symbols can randomly be replaced with one of the other symbols. This is called the Mystery Symbol function.\n\nNote! If the bean plant grows more than 10 times, the extra growth is added to the next plant. The cash prize in the chests is unique and changes as you spin the reels. It is calculated based on your average bet for that chest - even Golden Bee symbols increase the value by 2 times the bet.\n\nHow do you win at G.R.O.W slot?\nTo grow the bean plants, you must land the G.R.O.W scatter symbols on the reels - if a G.R.O.W symbol lands on reel 1, the sprout on reel 1 will begin to grow, and so on. If the G.R.O.W symbol is on reels 2, 3 or 4, it increases the height of the adjacent bean stalks. In addition, the Golden Bee and G.R.O.W icons act as wild symbols. Once you have reached optimal plant maturity, you can get big final wins and reap the fruits of your hard work!\n\nWhat is the trend of Free Spins in G.R.O.W?\nThe slot features a Free Spins function - this is played when you get 3 or more bonus symbols on the reels. You will then receive 10 free spins. Landing 3 bonus symbols in the function will reward you with an additional 10 free spins - in the function, they only appear on odd reels 1, 3 and 5.\n\nMy final opinion on G.R.O.W.\nThis game seems more suitable for amateur players than for veteran slot machine players who populate our AAMS/ADM casinos. The variance in winnings is not very high: you can win a maximum of 150 times your bet if you fill all reel positions with the wheelbarrow symbols, and 200 times the bet if you manage to fill the reels with wilds. The most substantial wins will come from the Magic Bean Treasure function, where cash prizes can reach 5,000 times the initial bet. If you love cartoon-themed slots, we recommend trying the free Honey Rush slot by Play'n Go, which has similar themes but more interesting wins or one of the many new titles just reviewed for you on Slotjava!\n            ",
