La caratteristica principale per quanto riguarda la grafica di questo gioco è proprio la sua linea essenziale, che si può apprezzare sia nella schermata principale, dove l’immagine di Bruce Lee e di un dragone appaiono a tutto schermo, sia nella griglia di gioco, molto semplice e con i rulli sui quali si alternano simboli legati alla cultura asiatica in generale e al mondo delle arti marziali in particolare.\nQuesta slot machine è ottimizzata per poter essere giocata non solo da computer desktop ma anche, attraverso Chrome e Safari, anche su tutti i dispositivi mobili sia iOS che Android\nCaratteristiche principali della slot\nBruce Lee è una slot che presenta 5 rulli e 60 linee di pagamento ed è caratterizzato da un gameplay decisamente poco articolato, sebbene con la presenza di alcuni simboli speciali tra cui Wild e Scatter, e la possibilità di ottenere dei giri gratuiti.\nAnticipiamo che se siete amanti delle slot machine con una modalità di gioco più complessa ma questo tema proprio vi è piaciuto, potrete optare per il sequel di Bruce Lee chiamato Bruce Lee Dragon’s Tale.\nBruce Lee è un gioco di slot a bassa volatilità, fondamentalmente a causa dei bassi importi che si possono scommettere: si possono effettuare delle puntate che vanno da 0,01 fino a 2 crediti per ogni linea di pagamento, per un totale di 60 monete. Come in ogni slot a bassa volatilità, anche con Bruce Lee c’è da aspettarsi di ottenere delle vincite frequenti ma di importo basso, mentre se si cercano premi di maggior valore, consigliamo di nuovo di provare Bruce Lee Dragon’s Tale.\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP) di Bruce Lee si attesta su un canonico 96,05%, niente di speciale ma del tutto nella media.\nSimboli di Bruce Lee\nI simboli che si alternano sui rulli di Bruce Lee sono fedeli al tema e comprendono lo stesso Bruce Lee, che tra tutte le icone è quella con valore maggiore, pagando 800 crediti, il calcio volante del nostro protagonista, il cappello cinese, il drago, un vaso, una pergamena, delle stelle ninja, delle monete d’oro ma anche un pugnale, uno scrigno del tesoro e i reali dal 9 all’Asso\nBruce Lee è il simbolo Jolly, che può sostituire tutte le altre icone tranne lo Scatter, mentre quest’ultimo è rappresentato da un forziere, che regala un numero variabile di giri gratuiti quando compare per almeno tre volte sui rulli.\nVerdetto\nBruce Lee è una slot semplice e dal gameplay molto intuitivo, adatta ai principianti e a chi ama i giochi “low-cost”.

The game has a simple design with Asian cultural symbols and martial arts elements. The graphics are basic without elaborate animations or special effects.\n\nGameplay and Rules\n\nBruce Lee is a 5-reel, 60-pay line slot game with uncomplicated gameplay and low volatility due to the low bet amounts. Players can bet from 0.01 to 2 credits per pay line. The game features a Wild symbol, represented by Bruce Lee, and a Scatter symbol, which triggers free spins when three or more chests appear on the reels.\n\nSymbols and their Values\n\nThe symbols in Bruce Lee include Bruce Lee, a flying kick, a Chinese hat, a dragon, a vase, a scroll, ninja stars, gold coins, a dagger, a treasure chest, and the Royals from 9 to Ace.

The main feature as far as the graphics of this game are concerned is precisely its essential line, which can be appreciated both in the main screen, where the image of Bruce Lee and a dragon appear in full screen, and in the game grid, which is very simple and with reels that alternate symbols related to Asian culture in general and the world of martial arts in particular.\nThis slot machine is optimized to be playable not only from desktop computers but also, through Chrome and Safari, on all mobile devices both iOS and Android.\nMain features of the slot\nBruce Lee is a slot game with 5 reels and 60 pay lines and is characterized by a gameplay that is decidedly uncomplicated, although with the presence of some special symbols including Wild and Scatter, and the possibility of obtaining free spins.\nWe anticipate that if you are a lover of slot machines with a more complex game mode but you liked this theme, you can opt for the sequel to Bruce Lee called Bruce Lee Dragon's Tale.\nBruce Lee is a low volatility slot game, fundamentally due to the low amounts that can be bet: bets can be placed ranging from 0.01 to 2 credits per pay line, for a total of 60 coins. As with any low volatility slot, with Bruce Lee, frequent but low amount wins are to be expected, while if you're looking for higher value prizes, we recommend trying Bruce Lee Dragon's Tale again.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of Bruce Lee is set at a canonical 96.05%, nothing special but completely average.\nBruce Lee symbols\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Bruce Lee are faithful to the theme and include the same Bruce Lee, which among all the icons is the one with the highest value, paying 800 credits, our protagonist's flying kick, the Chinese hat, the dragon, a vase, a scroll, ninja stars, gold coins but also a dagger, a treasure chest and the Royals from 9 to Ace.\nBruce Lee is the Wild symbol, which can replace all the other icons except the Scatter, while the latter is represented by a chest, which gives a variable number of free spins when it appears at least three times on the reels.\nVerdict\nBruce Lee is a simple slot game with very intuitive gameplay, suitable for beginners and those who love \"low-cost\" games. It doesn't promise high winnings or particular special functions, but it's smooth and fun to play.\n        ",
