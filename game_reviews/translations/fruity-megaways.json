Although the graphics are not superb, they are well-crafted, but the designs are relatively simple. However, this deficiency is compensated for by very smooth gameplay mechanics and a very entertaining gameplay.\n\nLike all Megaways slots, the ways to win change depending on the number of symbols that land on the grid. Indeed, the six reels behave independently, capable of welcoming from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 6 symbols. The minimum bet is 0.10 virtual coins, but you can raise it up to 50. Several features can be useful for calibrating the bet or making the gameplay closer to your own tastes: for example, there is the Turbo button that accelerates the fall of symbols or the cursor that transforms the computer's space bar into the Start button. \n\nWith Autoplay, you can set from 5 to 100 automatic spins and there is no need to set winning or losing limits. The variance is medium to high, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.06%.\n\nWinning at Fruity Megaways develops from left to right, starting from the first reel. The symbols are all fruit-themed, with raspberries, watermelons, grapes, bananas, strawberries, oranges, apples, and plums, in order of value. To know the exact value of each symbol, we recommend accessing the menu and consulting the payment table. Among the special symbols, we find the Wild, a Joker that replaces all symbols except the special ones, allowing us to complete a combo. The smoothie is the Scatter symbol, with 3, 4, 5, or 6, we win 10, 15, 20, and 25 Free Spins, respectively.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the gameplay mechanism is cascading, meaning that after each winning series, the winning symbols are removed, and the empty positions are occupied by new symbols.

You will find yourself in a green plain crossed by a river, where two smiling bananas take a bath. Behind them, giant pineapples replace the hills. \n\nThe game grid has a wooden frame, with the counter indicating consecutive combinations to the left and the table indicating the number of ways to win during the single play to the right. Although the graphics are not superb, they are well-crafted, but the designs are relatively simple. However, this deficiency is compensated for by very smooth gameplay mechanics and a very entertaining gameplay.\n\nLike all Megaways slots, the ways to win change depending on the number of symbols that land on the grid. Indeed, the six reels behave independently, capable of welcoming from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 6 symbols. The minimum bet is 0.10 virtual coins, but you can raise it up to 50. Several features can be useful for calibrating the bet or making the gameplay closer to your own tastes: for example, there is the Turbo button that accelerates the fall of symbols or the cursor that transforms the computer's space bar into the Start button. \n\nWith Autoplay, you can set from 5 to 100 automatic spins and there is no need to set winning or losing limits. The variance is medium to high, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.06%.\n\nWinning at Fruity Megaways develops from left to right, starting from the first reel. The symbols are all fruit-themed, with raspberries, watermelons, grapes, bananas, strawberries, oranges, apples, and plums, in order of value. To know the exact value of each symbol, we recommend accessing the menu and consulting the payment table. Among the special symbols, we find the Wild, a Joker that replaces all symbols except the special ones, allowing us to complete a combo. The smoothie is the Scatter symbol, with 3, 4, 5, or 6, we win 10, 15, 20, and 25 Free Spins, respectively.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the gameplay mechanism is cascading, meaning that after each winning series, the winning symbols are removed, and the empty positions are occupied by new symbols. The counter to the left indicates the number of reactions obtained. When we reach 5, the Pick Me function is activated, allowing us to select a fruit and receive sums of money, Free Spins, and multipliers, equal to x2, x10, x15, x20.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat is the highest payout I can get?\n\nIn this game, you can win an amount equal to 5,000 times your bet.\n\nHow many ways are there to win?\n\nIn Fruity Megaways, there are a whopping 117,649 ways to win.\n\nCan I play Fruity Megaways on my smartphone?\n\nYes, the game's HTML5 architecture makes it work on any mobile device with any operating system.\n        ",
