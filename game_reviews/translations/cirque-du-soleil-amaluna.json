The RTP is 96.5%, and the slot's volatility is medium. The objective of the game is to obtain as many Amaluna symbols as possible and the player needs at least 3 of them to get the first win. By finding 11 or more Amaluna symbols in the same spin, the player can reach the maximum value. There are also Scatter symbols that allow access to the Bonus mode and a Wild symbol represented by a shield that can replace all other symbols except the Scatter and Amaluna.\n\nVisuals and Sound Effects\n\nThe graphics of Cirque Du Soleil Amaluna are visually pleasing, with a dreamlike atmosphere serving as the backdrop for the playing grid. The sound effects and music are well-balanced and give the impression of being in a café or a pub, waiting for the show to start. The symbols are a combination of playing cards, various types of flowers, and personalities from Cirque Du Soleil, but overall, we could expect more impact given the topic used in the theme.\n\nWinning Symbols and Value\n\nThe main objective in Cirque Du Soleil Amaluna is to obtain as many Amaluna symbols as possible. By obtaining at least 3 of them, the player will get the first win, equal to the value of their bet. The more symbols the player finds, the higher the win, reaching the maximum value obtained by finding 11 or more Amaluna symbols in the same spin.\n\nBonus Mode\n\nCirque Du Soleil Amaluna has a Scatter symbol that allows access to the Bonus mode. The player can trigger the bonus round by landing 3 or more Scatter symbols on the reels, which will award free spins. During the free spins, the player can re-trigger the bonus round by landing an additional 3 or more Scatter symbols on the reels.\n\nComparison to Similar Bally Slot\n\nCirque Du Soleil Amaluna is quite unique, but if we had to indicate a similar slot, it would be Cirque Du Soleil Kooza, also produced by Bally. Both slots feature the same dreamlike atmosphere and visually pleasing graphics, but gameplay mechanics differ, with Cirque Du Soleil Kooza featuring a 5x3 grid and 40 paylines, and a slightly lower RTP of 96%.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics\n\nCirque Du Soleil Amaluna has the layout of a 5x4 grid, displaying twenty symbols per spin along 40 paylines. The game's RTP is 96.5%, making it in line with the industry average, with a medium level of volatility. The objective is to obtain as many Amaluna symbols as possible, with a minimum of 3 necessary to receive the first win, equal to the current bet. The value of the win will increase with more symbols acquired, with the maximum value earned by finding 11 or more Amaluna symbols in one spin. The slot also contains Wild and Scatter symbols, the latter of which is responsible for the Bonus mode.\n\nGraphics and sound effects\n\nCirque Du Soleil Amaluna has well-designed graphics and a fittingly atmospheric soundtrack. The background features dreamlike imagery, while symbols within the grid include Ace to Queen playing cards, different types of flowers, and characters from Cirque Du Soleil. The music sets the mood for the game, bringing a rhythmic and percussive composition that fits well with the show-theme. Despite the theme, the slot doesn't have the expected impact on the visuals, but is still executed tastefully.\n\nWinning symbols and value\n\nThe Amaluna symbols are the most valuable, with the objective of collecting as many as possible to win ever-increasing amounts. The Wild symbol can replace other game symbols (except the scatter and Amaluna symbols) as a wildcard. Scatter symbols trigger the bonus mode. The paytable changes dynamically as the player wagers, displaying the corresponding payouts on the top section of the game panel. A minimum of three matching symbols is required to land a winning combination.\n\nBonus features\n\nThe slot's bonus feature is triggered by landing three or more Scatter symbols and can award free spins. The number of free spins played is contingent on the number of Scatter symbols that originally triggered the bonus round, with the possibility of additional multipliers. The mode could be re-triggered if additional Scatter symbols land on the reels during the bonus round. The presence of the Wild symbol could also increase the player's chances of landing a winning combination during the bonus round.\n\nDeveloper comparison\n\nCirque Du Soleil Amaluna, produced by Bally, is a unique online slot game. Similar to Amaluna, the slot Cirque Du Soleil Kooza could be regarded as its sister game in the Bally portfolio. Both games use the Cirque Du Soleil brand as a theme, with Kooza being designed for a 3x4 grid layout with 40 paylines. The slot's volatility is also similar to Amaluna. However, the gameplay and design of the two slots differ significantly and have their distinct features.\n\n        \n            ",

Certainly, Bally has tried to make their game spectacular with one of the most exciting visual phenomena in the world, Cirque Du Soleil Amaluna.\nIn today's article, we will talk about the visual and sound department, as well as the purely gameplay mechanics, in order to offer a complete picture of this title for those who want to try it out.\nCirque Du Soleil Amaluna - Graphics and Sound\nThe music that welcomes us into the game has the perfect balance between rhythm and percussion, giving us the impression of being in a café or a pub, waiting for the show to start.\nTo the left is a Cirque Du Soleil Amaluna athlete, while the grid occupies the central part of the slot on a backdrop reminiscent of a dreamlike atmosphere.\nWithin the grid, symbols alternate between playing cards (Ace, King, Queen...), various types of flowers, and personalities from Cirque Du Soleil.\nOverall, we could expect something with more impact given the topic used in the theme, but ultimately the slot shows itself to us with good taste and ease of use.\nCirque Du Soleil Amaluna - Gameplay Mechanics\nLet's move on to talk about the technical functions that distinguish this slot: the game grid is a 5x4 type, showing twenty symbols per spin that are arranged along the 40 paylines.\nThe RTP, or the percentage of money that is distributed in the form of winnings compared to those played, is 96.5%, a value in line with the market average. The slot's volatility is medium, so it is reasonable to expect a good balance between spins without winning combinations and medium-value combinations.\nThe apparent goal of the game is to obtain as many Amaluna symbols as possible: by obtaining at least 3 of them, we will get the first win, equal to the value of our bet. The more symbols we find, the higher the win, reaching the maximum value obtained by finding 11 or more Amaluna symbols in the same spin (the various values ​​are shown in the top part of the grid).\nIn addition to these, there are also Scatter symbols that allow access to the Bonus mode and a Wild symbol represented by a shield that can replace all other symbols (except the Scatter and Amaluna) as a wildcard.\nAlthough the Amaluna function is different from many slots that can be found online, it is very easy to understand and the user will immediately understand how to navigate within Cirque Du Soleil Amaluna.\nSlots similar to Cirque Du Soleil Amaluna\nThe slot is quite unique and one of a kind, but if we had to indicate a title similar to the one we just talked about, it would probably be Cirque Du Soleil Kooza, a sister slot also produced by Bally.\n            ",

Certainly, Bally has tried to make their game spectacular with one of the most exciting visual phenomena in the world, Cirque Du Soleil Amaluna.\nIn today's article, we will talk about the visual and sound department, as well as the purely gameplay mechanics, in order to offer a complete picture of this title for those who want to try it out.\nCirque Du Soleil Amaluna - Graphics and Sound\nThe music that welcomes us into the game has the perfect balance between rhythm and percussion, giving us the impression of being in a café or a pub, waiting for the show to start.\nTo the left is a Cirque Du Soleil Amaluna athlete, while the grid occupies the central part of the slot on a backdrop reminiscent of a dreamlike atmosphere.\nWithin the grid, symbols alternate between playing cards (Ace, King, Queen...), various types of flowers, and personalities from Cirque Du Soleil.\nOverall, we could expect something with more impact given the topic used in the theme, but ultimately the slot shows itself to us with good taste and ease of use.\nCirque Du Soleil Amaluna - Gameplay Mechanics\nLet's move on to talk about the technical functions that distinguish this slot: the game grid is a 5x4 type, showing twenty symbols per spin that are arranged along the 40 paylines.\nThe RTP, or the percentage of money that is distributed in the form of winnings compared to those played, is 96.5%, a value in line with the market average. The slot's volatility is medium, so it is reasonable to expect a good balance between spins without winning combinations and medium-value combinations.\nThe apparent goal of the game is to obtain as many Amaluna symbols as possible: by obtaining at least 3 of them, we will get the first win, equal to the value of our bet. The more symbols we find, the higher the win, reaching the maximum value obtained by finding 11 or more Amaluna symbols in the same spin (the various values ​​are shown in the top part of the grid).\nIn addition to these, there are also Scatter symbols that allow access to the Bonus mode and a Wild symbol represented by a shield that can replace all other symbols (except the Scatter and Amaluna) as a wildcard.\nAlthough the Amaluna function is different from many slots that can be found online, it is very easy to understand and the user will immediately understand how to navigate within Cirque Du Soleil Amaluna.\nSlots similar to Cirque Du Soleil Amaluna\nThe slot is quite unique and one of a kind, but if we had to indicate a title similar to the one we just talked about, it would probably be Cirque Du Soleil Kooza, a sister slot also produced by Bally.\n            ",
