Below the reels, as always, we find the bar with the buttons for setting up the game. \n\nHow to play Monkey 27?\nThis fun Fruit Machine is based on a very simple gameplay and you will only need to memorize a few basic rules before starting to spin the reels. \nAs with traditional old land-based slot machines, Monkey 27 has only three reels but 27 paylines. By using the game setup controls found at the bottom of the screen, it is possible to set the bet value and decide on how many paylines to bet. \nAs with other slots from this software house, the volatility in Monkey 27 is also variable, which means it changes depending on the bet value: if you want to try to break the bank, you need to make an \"all in\" bet, i.e., betting the maximum allowed on all twenty-seven paylines. \nMonkey 27 also offers the possibility to preset the bet value and play in Autoplay mode! \n\nThe fruit: A timeless classic \nLike any respectable Fruit Machine, the symbols in Monkey 27 are fruits, which have different value and offer different prizes when they appear on all three reels. \nThe icons that appear most frequently are cherries, lemons, and oranges, and they are also the symbols that pay the least, offering a maximum win of 30 times the bet. \nPlums and grapes are the second in value and frequency, and allow you to win a prize equal to 100 times the bet. \nThe watermelon is the symbol that is worth the most among the fruits, but it is also the rarest: a combination made up of three watermelons pays 300 times the bet. \nIn addition to the fruit, we also have a Monkey, which functions as a Wild and leads to a prize of up to 1000 times the bet!",

Players can simply memorize the basics and start spinning the reels. The game features three reels and 27 paylines, which is a perfect fit for casual players and nostalgic fans of old land-based slots alike. The game setup controls are located at the bottom of the screen, allowing players to set the bet value and choose how many paylines to bet. Auto-play mode is also available for convenience.\n\nBet Value and Paylines\n\nMonkey 27 offers players the chance to set the bet value and choose how many of the 27 paylines to bet on. The volatility is variable, meaning that it changes depending on the bet value. For players looking to maximize their winnings, an 'all in' bet on all 27 paylines is the best option. The game's controls are easy to use and allow players to set the bet value and paylines, as well as access the auto-play mode for uninterrupted gameplay.\n\nSymbols and Prizes\n\nThe symbols in Monkey 27 are all classic fruits, each with a different value and prize when they appear on all three reels. The most frequent symbols are cherries, lemons, and oranges, which offer a maximum prize of 30 times the bet. Plums and grapes are the next most valuable symbols, where a combination of three can yield a prize of up to 100 times the bet. The watermelon is the rarest symbol and the most valuable of all the fruit symbols: three watermelons pay 300 times the bet. The Monkey symbol acts as a wild and can lead to a prize of up to 1000 times the bet! Overall, the payout for Monkey 27 is fair, and rewards are distributed quite decently.\n\nVariable Volatility\n\nOne unique feature of Monkey 27 is the game's variable volatility, which changes according to the bet value. Players can take advantage of this feature to maximize their winnings by placing an 'all in' bet on all 27 paylines. This means that the game is suitable for both risk-takers and casual players looking for a fun and fair slot experience.\n\nMonkey Wild Symbol\n\nApart from the fruit symbols, the game also features a Monkey Wild symbol that can appear on all three reels and substitute for any other symbols to form a winning combination. The Monkey symbol is rare but can earn a prize of up to 1000 times the bet, making it the most valuable symbol in the game. Players will find the Monkey Wild symbol to be particularly useful when chasing the game's maximum payout.\n\n        \n            ",
