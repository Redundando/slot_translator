E’ un gioco studiato per attirare un ampio range di pubblico, cercando anche un nuovo target di mercato. La parte più divertente tra tutte è la possibilità di avere totale comando delle azioni di gioco. Un gioco che ti porta a gestire dall’interno un carro armato pronto a colpire gli avversari abilmente nascosti su un campo di battaglia. Per ogni colpo sbagliato senza scovare i nemici verrai subito colpito dalle loro bombe e la tua scommessa finirà a vuoto. Cerca quindi di colpire prima di subire una spiacevole sorpresa!\nPer ogni colpo positivo che riesci a piazzare potrai moltiplicare la tua vincita e puntare a conquistare un ricco premio finale. Scopriamo come funziona questa slot che ha un RTP fissato al 93,65% e offre valide possibilità di vincita.\nLa grafica della slot Lucky Tanks\nOnlyplay ha scelto di partire da uno sfondo semplice, con un campo verde dove si posizionano rocce e arbusti, pronti a formare una finta griglia di gioco. Dietro di loro si posiziona un numero variabile di carri nemici: il tuo scopo è quello di trovarli senza sparare colpi a vuoto. Come è facile intuire è quindi un gioco che sviluppa un tema militare, dove tutto si basa su esplosioni e attrezzature militari. In alto potrai notare uno spazio dedicato alle tue medaglie d’onore: il valore aumenta man mano che realizzi dei colpi fortunati, senza subire un contrattacco che può essere per te micidiale e farti perder tutto ciò che hai accumulato fino a quel momento. Se non hai voglia di rischiare e osare puoi interrompere il gioco in qualsiasi momento e raccogliere le sue vincite.\nA livello grafico è tutto molto semplice, poco elaborato ma ben sviluppato: è tutto perfettamente costruito per riuscire a raccontare a dovere questo campo di guerra, riuscendo a offrire la giusta leggerezza e buon livello di allegria e intrattenimento.\nPer vincere però serve un po’ di pazienza, perché le scelte manuali che farai sono legate solo in parte a una strategia di gioco. Dovrai quindi provare e riprovare prima di riuscire a realizzare il grande colpo che metterà ko gli avversari.\nConsiderazioni finali su Lucky Tanks\nLa maggior parte delle slot realizzate da Onlyplay riescono a offrire sicuramente una buona esperienza prima di tutto in termini di grafica e gameplay, a prescindere dal tema scelto. I toni e colori sono rassicuranti, ben curati e le immagini sono affascinanti pur non volendo mai osare troppo. Sono molto intuitive le funzioni di gioco e non sono previste funzioni extra che in molti casi ci si potrebbe aspettare davanti alle slot tradizionali. Per riuscire a vivere bene questo gioco devi liberarti di ogni aspettativa: chi sceglie Onlyplay infatti è alla ricerca di qualcosa di diverso, che si allontani dalle classiche regole di una macchinetta online.\nSali a bordo del tuo carro armato e preparati a combattere per conquistare ricchi premi su terre selvagge.\n",

It is a game designed to attract a wide range of audiences, even targeting a new market. The most fun part of the game is the ability to have total control over the gameplay. You get to control a tank from the inside, ready to strike hidden opponents on a battlefield. Each missed shot without finding the enemy will result in immediate bombardment from their bombs, and your bet will be in vain. Try to hit before experiencing an unpleasant surprise and for every successful shot you place, you can multiply your winnings and aim to win a big prize. Let's explore how this slot works, which has an RTP set at 93.65% and offers valid winning opportunities.\n\nThe graphics of Lucky Tanks: \nOnlyplay chose to start with a simple background, with a green field where rocks and bushes are positioned, ready to form a fake game grid. Behind them, a variable number of enemy tanks is positioned: your goal is to find them without firing shots in vain. As it's easy to assume, it's a game that develops a military theme, where everything is based on explosions and military equipment. You can notice a space dedicated to your medals of honor at the top: the value increases as you make lucky shots, without suffering a counterattack that can be deadly for you and make you lose everything you have accumulated up to that moment. If you don't feel like risking and daring, you can interrupt the game at any time and collect your winnings.\n\nFinal thoughts on Lucky Tanks: \nMost of the slots made by Onlyplay can definitely offer a good experience primarily in terms of graphics and gameplay, regardless of the chosen theme. The tones and colors are reassuring, well-crafted, and the images are fascinating without ever wanting to dare too much. The game functions are very intuitive, and extra functions are not provided, which in many cases one may expect from traditional slot machines. To fully enjoy this game, you need to let go of any expectation: those who choose Onlyplay are looking for something different, moving away from the classic rules of an online machine.

Lucky Tanks, one of the newest gaming solutions from Onlyplay, launched in November 2020. It's a game designed to attract a wide range of audiences, while also targeting a new market. The most exciting part of it all is the ability to have total control over the gameplay. A game that brings you to manage a tank from the inside, ready to strike enemy players skillfully concealed on a battlefield. For every shot missed without finding the enemy, you will immediately be hit by their bombs and your bet will be lost. Therefore, try to hit before suffering an unpleasant surprise!\nFor every successful shot you manage to place, you can multiply your winnings and aim to conquer a rich final prize. Let's find out how this slot works, which has an RTP fixed at 93.65% and offers valid chances of winning.\nThe graphics of the Lucky Tanks slot:\nOnlyplay chose to start from a simple background, with a green field where rocks and bushes are placed to form a fake game grid. Behind them, there is a varying number of enemy tanks: your goal is to find them without firing any blank shots. As it is easy to understand, it is a game thatdevelops a military theme, where everything is based on explosions and military equipment. At the top, you can notice an area dedicated to your medals of honor: the value increases as you achieve lucky shots, without suffering a counterattack that can be deadly for you and make you lose everything you have accumulated up to that point. If you do not feel like risking and daring, you can interrupt the game at any time and collect your winnings.\nGraphically, everything is very simple, not elaborate but well developed: everything is perfectly built to properly tell this war field, managing to offer the right lightness and good level of joy and entertainment.\nTo win, however, a little patience is needed because the manual choices you make are only partially related to a gaming strategy. You will have to try and try again before succeeding in making the big shot that will knock out the opponents.\nFinal considerations on Lucky Tanks:\nMost of the slots made by Onlyplay can certainly offer a good experience first and foremost in terms of graphics and gameplay, regardless of the chosen theme. The tones and colors are reassuring, well cared for, and the images are fascinating, without ever wanting to dare too much. The game functions are very intuitive and there are no extra functions that are often expected in front of traditional slots. To enjoy this game properly, you must let go of any expectation: those who choose Onlyplay are looking for something different, something that breaks away from the classic rules of an online machine.\nHop on board your tank and get ready to fight to conquer rich prizes on wild lands.\n            ",

It is a game that attracts a wide range of audiences and aims to target a new market. The most exciting part of the game is the player's total control over the gameplay.\n\nCombination of slot machines and lotteries\n\nLucky Tanks is a slot game that combines slot machines and lotteries. Players have the opportunity to control the gameplay and manage a tank from the inside, ready to strike enemy players on a battlefield. The game is based on a military theme and features explosions and military equipment. For every successful shot, players can multiply their winnings and aim for the rich final prize.\n\nPlayer control over gameplay\n\nLucky Tanks allows for total player control over the gameplay. Players manage a tank from the inside, trying to aim and hit enemy players on a battlefield without firing any blank shots. However, if they miss, they will be hit by their enemy's bombs and lose their bet. The game offers a simple background with a green field where rocks and bushes form a fake game grid, behind which the enemy tanks are concealed. Players can interrupt the game at any time and collect their winnings. The RTP of the game is fixed at 93.65%, and it offers valid chances of winning.\n\nGameplay and rules\n\nThe gameplay of Lucky Tanks is simple but requires some patience. The manual choices players make are only partially related to a gaming strategy, and they will have to keep trying until they make the big shot that knocks out the opponents. Every successful shot multiplies the winnings and aims to conquer the rich final prize. If the player misses, they will be hit by their enemy's bombs and lose their bet. The game has an RTP fixed at 93.65%.\n\nDesign and graphics\n\nLucky Tanks has a military theme and features explosions and military equipment. Onlyplay opted for a simple background with a green field, rocks, and bushes forming a fake game grid. The varying number of enemy tanks is concealed behind these obstacles, providing players with the challenging opportunity to find them without firing any blank shots. The graphics are well developed and tell the story of a war field while offering the right level of joy and entertainment. The game functions are very intuitive, and there are no extra functions that are often expected in front of traditional slots.\n\n        \n            ",

Lucky Tanks, one of the newest gaming solutions from Onlyplay, launched in November 2020. It's a game designed to attract a wide range of audiences, while also targeting a new market. The most exciting part of it all is the ability to have total control over the gameplay. A game that brings you to manage a tank from the inside, ready to strike enemy players skillfully concealed on a battlefield. For every shot missed without finding the enemy, you will immediately be hit by their bombs and your bet will be lost. Therefore, try to hit before suffering an unpleasant surprise!\nFor every successful shot you manage to place, you can multiply your winnings and aim to conquer a rich final prize. Let's find out how this slot works, which has an RTP fixed at 93.65% and offers valid chances of winning.\nThe graphics of the Lucky Tanks slot:\nOnlyplay chose to start from a simple background, with a green field where rocks and bushes are placed to form a fake game grid. Behind them, there is a varying number of enemy tanks: your goal is to find them without firing any blank shots. As it is easy to understand, it is a game thatdevelops a military theme, where everything is based on explosions and military equipment. At the top, you can notice an area dedicated to your medals of honor: the value increases as you achieve lucky shots, without suffering a counterattack that can be deadly for you and make you lose everything you have accumulated up to that point. If you do not feel like risking and daring, you can interrupt the game at any time and collect your winnings.\nGraphically, everything is very simple, not elaborate but well developed: everything is perfectly built to properly tell this war field, managing to offer the right lightness and good level of joy and entertainment.\nTo win, however, a little patience is needed because the manual choices you make are only partially related to a gaming strategy. You will have to try and try again before succeeding in making the big shot that will knock out the opponents.\nFinal considerations on Lucky Tanks:\nMost of the slots made by Onlyplay can certainly offer a good experience first and foremost in terms of graphics and gameplay, regardless of the chosen theme. The tones and colors are reassuring, well cared for, and the images are fascinating, without ever wanting to dare too much. The game functions are very intuitive and there are no extra functions that are often expected in front of traditional slots. To enjoy this game properly, you must let go of any expectation: those who choose Onlyplay are looking for something different, something that breaks away from the classic rules of an online machine.\nHop on board your tank and get ready to fight to conquer rich prizes on wild lands.\n            ",
