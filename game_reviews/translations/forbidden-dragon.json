            "response": "Welcome to the mystical and mythical China with the free slot Forbidden Dragon produced by the provider WMS. Graphically, this game with a Colossal Reel engine takes on the gold color across the screen, highlighting the features of the dragons positioned on the side of the sacred temple. Keep reading my review to take advantage of all the extra features offered by this solemn eastern slot!\n\nGameplay of Forbidden Dragon\nThe gameplay works perfectly on any device. Available to play from 50 cents to 100 euros per spin on all 100 paylines, this wonderful slot makes the most of its unusual layout to give you the opportunity to win considerable amounts. With the transfer of wilds and free spins, the Colossal Reel game engine offers truly colossal winning opportunities. The user interface is clear and well-structured, so it's easy to access autoplay options, paytable information, and game rules. There is also a very cinematic soundtrack that engages you in gameplay for a very immersive experience. The theoretical RTP offered is 95.91%, which is a reasonable payout ratio for this style of game. Like other Colossal Reel slots, the volatility is high, making it ideal for players who enjoy the adrenaline of big risks and big wins.\n\nWhat are the symbols on the paytable?\nThere are the usual royals of the four playing card suits. They are joined by some very traditional Chinese symbols:\n\nThe Jade Lion protector of success and prosperity\nLongmu, the mother of dragons\nEmperor Qin Shi Huang, who shows Longmu gold and jade gifts\nThe Red Dragon reminiscent of Fucanglong, the guardian dragon of hidden treasures\nThe Green Dragon is Dilong, protector of the Earth\nThe Bearded Dragon may be the Dragon King Ao Guang, representing ultimate power, strength, and good luck.\n\nHow to win at Forbidden Dragon slot?\nWith 100 paylines spread across 2 sets of reels, a 5×4 grid and the Colossal Reel with its 5×12 layout, there are more opportunities to create combinations of 3 or more symbols on a payline. Each winning combination reads from left to right from the leftmost reel. The highest paying symbols are the Dragon King and the Green Dragon, which deliver 5x and 4x wins respectively on your line when you get 5 symbols on a winning line: all payouts are in multipliers, so obviously the higher the bet, the bigger the return. Although individual returns may not be huge, playing on 100 paylines creates many opportunities to get more wins and bigger payouts.\n\nWhat are the Bonus Features in this game?\nBuilt by WMS on the Colossal Reel game engine, there are bonuses to be exploited both in the base gameplay and with free spins in this slot. Let's take a look at them together:\n\nWild Transfer - Yin and Yang is the wild symbol in this slot and replaces all other symbols except the bonus. Spin 4 symbols in a stack on the smaller set of reels and they will transfer to the same position on the larger set, creating many winning possibilities. Before a rotation occurs, some of the adjacent positions on each reel can be filled with random symbols to form additional winning combinations;\nFree Spins Bonus - The Dragon Head symbol is the bonus and three or more of it activates the free spins feature. This symbol appears on reels 1, 3 and 5 on the standard and Colossal reels. Land between 3 and 6 scatter symbols anywhere in view to receive the following prizes:\n\n\n3 symbols: 8 free spins and 2x multiplier\n4 symbols: 12 free spins and 5x multiplier\n5 or 6 symbols: 20 free spins and 20x multiplier\n\nJust like in the base game, random symbols will occupy adjacent reel positions and wins on the Colossal Reel set are subject to an additional 25x multiplier. Unlock bonus features including wilds and scatters and you could play for 2,500 times your line bet on each free spin!\n\nMy final verdict on Forbidden Dragon slot\nForbidden Dragon is another WMS slot that uses the Colossal Reels game engine to offer the potential for colossal wins. Needless to say, this slot makes the most of its Chinese theme to cover the reels with symbols made very faithful to the original illustrations related to luck. As I already mentioned earlier, it is a highly volatile slot, so you will need to be patient if you want to get the free spins bonus. If you love the Colossal Reel game engine, you will come back to play this slot several times to look for greater wins from the bonuses, just like I did!\n\nMost Frequently Asked Questions about Forbidden Dragon\nCan I play Forbidden Dragon slot for free?\n\nOf course, you can!

Sebbene i rendimenti individuali possano non essere enormi, giocare su 100 linee di pagamento crea molte opportunità per ottenere più vincite e pagamenti maggiori.\nQuali sono le Funzionalità Bonus in questo gioco?\nCostruita da WMS sul motore di gioco Colossal Reels, in questa slot ci sono bonus da sfruttare sia nel gameplay di base che con giri gratuiti. Vediamoli insieme:\n\nTrasferimento di jolly – il simbolo Yin e Yang è il jolly in questo slot e sostituisce tutti gli altri simboli tranne il bonus. Ruota 4 simboli in pila sul set più piccolo di rulli e si trasferiranno nella stessa posizione sul set più grande creando molte possibilità di vincita. Prima che avvenga una rotazione, alcune delle posizioni adiacenti su ciascuna bobina possono essere riempite con simboli casuali per formare combinazioni vincenti aggiuntive;\nBonus di Giri Gratuiti – il simbolo Testa di Drago è il bonus e tre o più di esso attivano la funzione giri gratuiti. Questo simbolo appare sui rulli 1, 3 e 5 sui rulli standard e Colossal. Fai atterrare tra 3 e 6 scatter ovunque in vista per ottenere i seguenti premi:\n\n\n3 simboli: 8 giri gratuiti e 2x moltiplicatore\n4 simboli: 12 giri gratuiti e 5x moltiplicatore\n5 o 6 simboli: 20 giri gratuiti e 20x moltiplicatore\n\nProprio come nel gioco base, i simboli casuali occuperanno le posizioni dei rulli adiacenti e le vincite sul set di rulli Colossal sono soggette a un moltiplicatore aggiuntivo di 25x. Sblocca le funzionalità bonus tra cui il jolly e lo scatter e potresti giocare per 2.500 volte la tua linea scommessa su ogni giro gratuito!\nIl mio verdetto finale su Forbidden Dragons\nForbidden Dragons è un altra slot WMS che utilizza il motore di gioco Colossal Reels per offrire il potenziale per vittorie colossali. Inutile dire che questa slot sfrutta al massimo il suo tema cinese per coprire i rulli con simboli realizzati in modo molto fedele alle illustrazioni originali legate alla fortuna. Come ti ho già anticipato in precedenza si tratta di una slot  altamente volatile, quindi dovrai essere paziente se vorrai ottenere i bonus dei giri gratuiti. Se ami il motore di gioco Colossal Reel, tornerai a giocare con questa slot diverse volte per cercare maggiori vincite dai bonus, proprio come ho fatto io!\n\nFAQS più frequenti su Forbidden Dragons \nPosso giocare gratuitamente alle slot Forbidden Dragons?\n\nCerto che puoi!

Graphically, this game featuring a Colossal Reel engine takes on the color of gold on the entire screen, highlighting the features of the dragons positioned on both sides of the sacred temple. Read on below for my review to take advantage of all the extra features offered by this grand oriental slot game!\n\nGameplay of Forbidden Dragons\nThe gameplay works seamlessly on any device. Available to play from 50 cents to 100 euros per spin across all 100 paylines, this wonderful slot game makes the most of its unusual layout to give you the opportunity to win significant amounts. With the transfer of wilds and free spins, the Colossal Reel game engine offers truly colossal opportunities for big wins. The user interface is clear and well-structured, making it easy to access autoplay options, paytable information, and game rules. There’s also a very cinematic soundtrack that immerses you in the gameplay for a very engaging experience. The theoretical RTP offered is 95.91%, which is a reasonable payout ratio for this type of game. Like the other Colossal Reel slots, volatility is high, making it ideal for players who enjoy the adrenaline rush of big risks and big wins.\n\nWhat symbols are present on the paytable?\nThere are the usual royal symbols of the four playing card suits. These are joined by some very traditional Chinese symbols:\n\nThe jade lion protector of success and prosperity.\nLongmu, the mother of dragons.\nEmperor Qin Shi Huang, who shows Longmu gifts of gold and jade.\nThe Red Dragon reminiscent of the Fucanglong, the guardian dragon of hidden treasures.\nThe Green Dragon is Dilong, protector of the Earth.\nThe Bearded Dragon who could be the Dragon King Ao Guang, representing ultimate power, strength, and good fortune.\n\nHow do you win at Forbidden Dragons?\nWith 100 paylines spread across the 2 sets of reels, a 5x4 grid and the Colossal Reel with its 5x12 layout, there are more opportunities to create combinations of 3 or more symbols on a payline. Each winning combination reads from left to right from the leftmost reel. The highest paying symbols are the Dragon King and Green Dragon, which deliver payouts of 5x and 4x respectively on your line when you get 5 symbols on a winning line: all payouts are in multipliers, so obviously the larger the bet, the bigger the return. Although individual returns may not be enormous, playing on 100 paylines creates many opportunities to get more wins and bigger payouts.\n\nWhat are the bonus features in this game?\nBuilt by WMS on the Colossal Reels game engine, there are bonuses to be had both in the base gameplay and with free spins. Let's take a look at them:\n\nWild transfer - the Yin and Yang symbol is the wild in this slot and replaces all other symbols except the bonus. Spin 4 symbols stacked on the smaller set of reels and they will transfer to the same position on the larger set, creating many opportunities to win. Before a rotation happens, some of the adjacent positions on each reel may be filled with random symbols to form additional winning combinations;\nFree Spins Bonus - the Dragon Head symbol is the bonus and three or more of it activate the free spins feature. This symbol appears on reels 1, 3, and 5 on both the standard and Colossal reels. Land between 3 and 6 scatters anywhere on view to get the following prizes:\n\n\n3 symbols: 8 free spins and 2x multiplier.\n4 symbols: 12 free spins and 5x multiplier.\n5 or 6 symbols: 20 free spins and 20x multiplier.\n\nJust like in the base game, random symbols will occupy the positions of the adjacent reels and wins on the Colossal Reel set are subject to an additional 25x multiplier. Unlock the bonus features including wild and scatter and you could play for 2,500 times your line bet on each free spin!\n\nMy final verdict on Forbidden Dragons\nForbidden Dragons is another WMS slot that uses the Colossal Reels game engine to offer the potential for colossal wins. Needless to say, this slot makes the most of its Chinese theme, covering the reels with symbols rendered very faithfully to the original illustrations related to fortune. As I mentioned earlier, it is a highly volatile slot, so you will need to be patient if you want to get the free spins bonuses. If you love the Colossal Reel game engine, you will come back to play this slot several times to seek greater wins from the bonuses, just like I did!\n\nMost Frequently Asked Questions about Forbidden Dragons\nCan I play Forbidden Dragons slot for free?\n\nOf course you can!

Graphically, this game featuring a Colossal Reel engine takes on the color of gold on the entire screen, highlighting the features of the dragons positioned on both sides of the sacred temple. Read on below for my review to take advantage of all the extra features offered by this grand oriental slot game!\n\nGameplay of Forbidden Dragons\nThe gameplay works seamlessly on any device. Available to play from 50 cents to 100 euros per spin across all 100 paylines, this wonderful slot game makes the most of its unusual layout to give you the opportunity to win significant amounts. With the transfer of wilds and free spins, the Colossal Reel game engine offers truly colossal opportunities for big wins. The user interface is clear and well-structured, making it easy to access autoplay options, paytable information, and game rules. There’s also a very cinematic soundtrack that immerses you in the gameplay for a very engaging experience. The theoretical RTP offered is 95.91%, which is a reasonable payout ratio for this type of game. Like the other Colossal Reel slots, volatility is high, making it ideal for players who enjoy the adrenaline rush of big risks and big wins.\n\nWhat symbols are present on the paytable?\nThere are the usual royal symbols of the four playing card suits. These are joined by some very traditional Chinese symbols:\n\nThe jade lion protector of success and prosperity.\nLongmu, the mother of dragons.\nEmperor Qin Shi Huang, who shows Longmu gifts of gold and jade.\nThe Red Dragon reminiscent of the Fucanglong, the guardian dragon of hidden treasures.\nThe Green Dragon is Dilong, protector of the Earth.\nThe Bearded Dragon who could be the Dragon King Ao Guang, representing ultimate power, strength, and good fortune.\n\nHow do you win at Forbidden Dragons?\nWith 100 paylines spread across the 2 sets of reels, a 5x4 grid and the Colossal Reel with its 5x12 layout, there are more opportunities to create combinations of 3 or more symbols on a payline. Each winning combination reads from left to right from the leftmost reel. The highest paying symbols are the Dragon King and Green Dragon, which deliver payouts of 5x and 4x respectively on your line when you get 5 symbols on a winning line: all payouts are in multipliers, so obviously the larger the bet, the bigger the return. Although individual returns may not be enormous, playing on 100 paylines creates many opportunities to get more wins and bigger payouts.\n\nWhat are the bonus features in this game?\nBuilt by WMS on the Colossal Reels game engine, there are bonuses to be had both in the base gameplay and with free spins. Let's take a look at them:\n\nWild transfer - the Yin and Yang symbol is the wild in this slot and replaces all other symbols except the bonus. Spin 4 symbols stacked on the smaller set of reels and they will transfer to the same position on the larger set, creating many opportunities to win. Before a rotation happens, some of the adjacent positions on each reel may be filled with random symbols to form additional winning combinations;\nFree Spins Bonus - the Dragon Head symbol is the bonus and three or more of it activate the free spins feature. This symbol appears on reels 1, 3, and 5 on both the standard and Colossal reels. Land between 3 and 6 scatters anywhere on view to get the following prizes:\n\n\n3 symbols: 8 free spins and 2x multiplier.\n4 symbols: 12 free spins and 5x multiplier.\n5 or 6 symbols: 20 free spins and 20x multiplier.\n\nJust like in the base game, random symbols will occupy the positions of the adjacent reels and wins on the Colossal Reel set are subject to an additional 25x multiplier. Unlock the bonus features including wild and scatter and you could play for 2,500 times your line bet on each free spin!\n\nMy final verdict on Forbidden Dragons\nForbidden Dragons is another WMS slot that uses the Colossal Reels game engine to offer the potential for colossal wins. Needless to say, this slot makes the most of its Chinese theme, covering the reels with symbols rendered very faithfully to the original illustrations related to fortune. As I mentioned earlier, it is a highly volatile slot, so you will need to be patient if you want to get the free spins bonuses. If you love the Colossal Reel game engine, you will come back to play this slot several times to seek greater wins from the bonuses, just like I did!\n\nMost Frequently Asked Questions about Forbidden Dragons\nCan I play Forbidden Dragons slot for free?\n\nOf course you can! At Slotjava, we have a collection of demo slots, including those from WMS which can be played from our handy drop-down menu.\n\nDoes the Forbidden Dragons slot include free spins?\n\nThe free spins feature in this slot is the most profitable of the game, it gets up to 20 free spins with a 20x multiplier, plus an extra 5x multiplier for the Colossal Reel wins.\n\nCan I win real money playing Forbidden Dragons slots?\n\nIf you play in one of our ADM online casinos, you can play this slot to win cash prizes.

Read on below for my review to take advantage of all the extra features offered by this grand oriental slot game!\n\nGameplay of Forbidden Dragons\nThe gameplay works seamlessly on any device. Available to play from 50 cents to 100 euros per spin across all 100 paylines, this wonderful slot game makes the most of its unusual layout to give you the opportunity to win significant amounts. With the transfer of wilds and free spins, the Colossal Reel game engine offers truly colossal opportunities for big wins. The user interface is clear and well-structured, making it easy to access autoplay options, paytable information, and game rules. There’s also a very cinematic soundtrack that immerses you in the gameplay for a very engaging experience. The theoretical RTP offered is 95.91%, which is a reasonable payout ratio for this type of game. Like the other Colossal Reel slots, volatility is high, making it ideal for players who enjoy the adrenaline rush of big risks and big wins.\n\nWhat symbols are present on the paytable?\nThere are the usual royal symbols of the four playing card suits. These are joined by some very traditional Chinese symbols:\n\nThe jade lion protector of success and prosperity.\nLongmu, the mother of dragons.\nEmperor Qin Shi Huang, who shows Longmu gifts of gold and jade.\nThe Red Dragon reminiscent of the Fucanglong, the guardian dragon of hidden treasures.\nThe Green Dragon is Dilong, protector of the Earth.\nThe Bearded Dragon who could be the Dragon King Ao Guang, representing ultimate power, strength, and good fortune.\n\nHow do you win at Forbidden Dragons?\nWith 100 paylines spread across the 2 sets of reels, a 5x4 grid and the Colossal Reel with its 5x12 layout, there are more opportunities to create combinations of 3 or more symbols on a payline. Each winning combination reads from left to right from the leftmost reel. The highest paying symbols are the Dragon King and Green Dragon, which deliver payouts of 5x and 4x respectively on your line when you get 5 symbols on a winning line: all payouts are in multipliers, so obviously the larger the bet, the bigger the return. Although individual returns may not be enormous, playing on 100 paylines creates many opportunities to get more wins and bigger payouts.\n\nWhat are the bonus features in this game?\nBuilt by WMS on the Colossal Reels game engine, there are bonuses to be had both in the base gameplay and with free spins. Let's take a look at them:\n\nWild transfer - the Yin and Yang symbol is the wild in this slot and replaces all other symbols except the bonus. Spin 4 symbols stacked on the smaller set of reels and they will transfer to the same position on the larger set, creating many opportunities to win. Before a rotation happens, some of the adjacent positions on each reel may be filled with random symbols to form additional winning combinations;\nFree Spins Bonus - the Dragon Head symbol is the bonus and three or more of it activate the free spins feature. This symbol appears on reels 1, 3, and 5 on both the standard and Colossal reels. Land between 3 and 6 scatters anywhere on view to get the following prizes:\n\n\n3 symbols: 8 free spins and 2x multiplier.\n4 symbols: 12 free spins and 5x multiplier.\n5 or 6 symbols: 20 free spins and 20x multiplier.\n\nJust like in the base game, random symbols will occupy the positions of the adjacent reels and wins on the Colossal Reel set are subject to an additional 25x multiplier. Unlock the bonus features including wild and scatter and you could play for 2,500 times your line bet on each free spin!\n\nMy final verdict on Forbidden Dragons\nForbidden Dragons is another WMS slot that uses the Colossal Reels game engine to offer the potential for colossal wins. Needless to say, this slot makes the most of its Chinese theme, covering the reels with symbols rendered very faithfully to the original illustrations related to fortune. As I mentioned earlier, it is a highly volatile slot, so you will need to be patient if you want to get the free spins bonuses. If you love the Colossal Reel game engine, you will come back to play this slot several times to seek greater wins from the bonuses, just like I did!\n\nMost Frequently Asked Questions about Forbidden Dragons\nCan I play Forbidden Dragons slot for free?\n\nOf course you can! At Slotjava, we have a collection of demo slots, including those from WMS which can be played from our handy drop-down menu.\n\nDoes the Forbidden Dragons slot include free spins?\n\nThe free spins feature in this slot is the most profitable of the game, it gets up to 20 free spins with a 20x multiplier, plus an extra 5x multiplier for the Colossal Reel wins.\n\nCan I win real money playing Forbidden Dragons slots?\n\nIf you play in one of our ADM online casinos, you can play this slot to win cash prizes.
