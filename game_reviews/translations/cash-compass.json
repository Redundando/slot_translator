Prodotta dalla Hacksaw Gaming, questa slot si ispira a una di quelle storie che da secoli affascinano le persone di tutto il mondo: i pirati e le isole deserte dei Caraibi. È proprio il mare cristallino e le palme lussureggianti che fanno da sfondo alla griglia di gioco, qui rappresentata da una pergamena inchiodata a una tavola di legno. I simboli ricordano i disegni dei cartoni animati e anche se la grafica non è eccelsa, questo non è un problema, anzi: meno pesante è il software, migliore è la fluidità del gioco! Sulla parte alta della griglia si trova il titolo della slot, dove la “o” di Compass è rappresentata dalla bussola con una funzione particolare durante uno dei vari giochi bonus presenti. Nella parte bassa trovate i tasti per accedere al menù e per attivare i giri automatici, oltre alle freccette che permettono di aumentare o diminuire la puntata.\nCaratteristiche principali\nLa griglia ha 6 rulli e 6 righe e le combinazioni vincenti si ottengono con simboli uguali adiacenti. In tal senso le linee paganti si possono dipanare in orizzontale, in verticale, in diagonale, su linee spezzate. La vincita massima supera 7.400 volte la puntata ed è possibile attivare tra i 10 e i 1.000 giri automatici. La puntata minima è pari a 0,20 €, la massima a 100 €. L’RTP è abbastanza buono, pari al 96,42%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nCome già detto, si vince se compaiono almeno sei simboli adiacenti. Quelli legati alle carte da gioco, J, Q, K e A sono quelli che pagano meno: con la puntata minima si va da 0,02 € per 6 simboli sino a un massimo di 2 € per 15 o più simboli. La mappa e lo scudo hanno un range di vittoria compreso tra 0,10 € e 12 €, l’ampolla e il pappagallo 0,20 € min. – 26 € max. e infine la bussola, il vero simbolo del gioco: 30 o più di questi simboli permettono di vincere 200 €! Se compaiono almeno 5 bussole, vedremo la bussola sul logo riempirsi progressivamente con delle linee rosse, dopodiché l’ago si muoverà fermandosi poi su un punto cardinale. A questo punto tutte le bussole si espanderanno seguendo la direzione indicata dall’ago! Le bottiglie hanno invece la funzione di Scatter e con almeno 3 si ottengono 10 giri gratuiti. Durante i Free Spins, ogni volta che appare una bussola sui rulli quella sul logo comincia a ruotare e appariranno altri simboli uguali. In base alla posizione in cui si ferma l’ago, tutti i simboli speciali si espanderanno.\nCon 3 simboli Bonus si attiva un gioco speciale: la griglia viene sostituita da una ruota suddivisa in 8 sezioni con moltiplicatori 1X. Ogni volta che la ruota si ferma su un moltiplicatore, questo viene potenziato sino a 250X. Si hanno a disposizione 50 giri di ruota, a meno che l’ago non si fermi sul simbolo del teschio, in tal caso il gioco bonus si ferma e si torna a quello base.\n",

Produced by Hacksaw Gaming, this slot is inspired by one of those stories that have fascinated people all over the world for centuries: pirates and the deserted islands of the Caribbean. It is the crystal clear sea and lush palms that form the backdrop to the game grid, here represented by a parchment nailed to a wooden board. The symbols are reminiscent of cartoon drawings and even though the graphics are not excellent, this is not a problem, in fact: the lighter the software, the smoother the game! At the top of the grid is the title of the slot, where the \"o\" in Compass is represented by a compass with a special function during one of the various bonus games available. At the bottom you will find the buttons to access the menu and activate automatic spins, as well as the arrows that allow you to increase or decrease your bet.\n\nMain features\nThe grid has 6 reels and 6 rows and winning combinations are obtained with adjacent matching symbols. In this sense, the paying lines can be unwound horizontally, vertically, diagonally, on broken lines. The maximum win exceeds 7,400 times the bet and between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins can be activated. The minimum bet is €0.20, the maximum is €100. The RTP is quite good, at 96.42%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\nAs already mentioned, you win if at least six adjacent symbols appear. Those related to playing cards, J, Q, K and A, are the ones that pay the least: with the minimum bet they range from €0.02 for 6 symbols up to a maximum of €2 for 15 or more symbols. The map and the shield have a winning range between €0.10 and €12, the bottle and the parrot range from €0.20 min. - €26 max. and finally the compass, the true symbol of the game: 30 or more of these symbols allow you to win €200! If at least 5 compasses appear, we will see the compass on the logo progressively fill with red lines, after which the needle will move and finally stop at a cardinal point. At this point, all the compasses will expand following the direction indicated by the needle! The bottles instead have the function of Scatter and with at least 3 of them, 10 free spins are obtained. During Free Spins, every time a compass appears on the reels, the one on the logo starts to rotate and more matching symbols appear. Based on where the needle stops, all special symbols will expand.\n\nWith 3 Bonus symbols, a special game is activated: the grid is replaced by a wheel divided into 8 sections with 1X multipliers. Every time the wheel stops on a multiplier, it is powered up to 250X. You have 50 wheel spins available, unless the needle stops on the skull symbol, in which case the bonus game ends and you return to the base game.\n            ",

Produced by Hacksaw Gaming, this slot is inspired by one of those stories that have fascinated people all over the world for centuries: pirates and the deserted islands of the Caribbean. It is the crystal clear sea and lush palms that form the backdrop to the game grid, here represented by a parchment nailed to a wooden board. The symbols are reminiscent of cartoon drawings and even though the graphics are not excellent, this is not a problem, in fact: the lighter the software, the smoother the game! At the top of the grid is the title of the slot, where the \"o\" in Compass is represented by a compass with a special function during one of the various bonus games available. At the bottom you will find the buttons to access the menu and activate automatic spins, as well as the arrows that allow you to increase or decrease your bet.\n\nMain features\nThe grid has 6 reels and 6 rows and winning combinations are obtained with adjacent matching symbols. In this sense, the paying lines can be unwound horizontally, vertically, diagonally, on broken lines. The maximum win exceeds 7,400 times the bet and between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins can be activated. The minimum bet is €0.20, the maximum is €100. The RTP is quite good, at 96.42%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\nAs already mentioned, you win if at least six adjacent symbols appear. Those related to playing cards, J, Q, K and A, are the ones that pay the least: with the minimum bet they range from €0.02 for 6 symbols up to a maximum of €2 for 15 or more symbols. The map and the shield have a winning range between €0.10 and €12, the bottle and the parrot range from €0.20 min. - €26 max. and finally the compass, the true symbol of the game: 30 or more of these symbols allow you to win €200! If at least 5 compasses appear, we will see the compass on the logo progressively fill with red lines, after which the needle will move and finally stop at a cardinal point. At this point, all the compasses will expand following the direction indicated by the needle! The bottles instead have the function of Scatter and with at least 3 of them, 10 free spins are obtained. During Free Spins, every time a compass appears on the reels, the one on the logo starts to rotate and more matching symbols appear. Based on where the needle stops, all special symbols will expand.\n\nWith 3 Bonus symbols, a special game is activated: the grid is replaced by a wheel divided into 8 sections with 1X multipliers. Every time the wheel stops on a multiplier, it is powered up to 250X. You have 50 wheel spins available, unless the needle stops on the skull symbol, in which case the bonus game ends and you return to the base game.\n            ",

Produced by Hacksaw Gaming, this slot is inspired by one of those stories that have fascinated people all over the world for centuries: pirates and the deserted islands of the Caribbean. It is the crystal clear sea and lush palms that form the backdrop to the game grid, here represented by a parchment nailed to a wooden board. The symbols are reminiscent of cartoon drawings and even though the graphics are not excellent, this is not a problem, in fact: the lighter the software, the smoother the game! At the top of the grid is the title of the slot, where the \"o\" in Compass is represented by a compass with a special function during one of the various bonus games available. At the bottom you will find the buttons to access the menu and activate automatic spins, as well as the arrows that allow you to increase or decrease your bet.\n\nMain features\nThe grid has 6 reels and 6 rows and winning combinations are obtained with adjacent matching symbols. In this sense, the paying lines can be unwound horizontally, vertically, diagonally, on broken lines. The maximum win exceeds 7,400 times the bet and between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins can be activated. The minimum bet is €0.20, the maximum is €100. The RTP is quite good, at 96.42%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\nAs already mentioned, you win if at least six adjacent symbols appear. Those related to playing cards, J, Q, K and A, are the ones that pay the least: with the minimum bet they range from €0.02 for 6 symbols up to a maximum of €2 for 15 or more symbols. The map and the shield have a winning range between €0.10 and €12, the bottle and the parrot range from €0.20 min. - €26 max. and finally the compass, the true symbol of the game: 30 or more of these symbols allow you to win €200! If at least 5 compasses appear, we will see the compass on the logo progressively fill with red lines, after which the needle will move and finally stop at a cardinal point. At this point, all the compasses will expand following the direction indicated by the needle! The bottles instead have the function of Scatter and with at least 3 of them, 10 free spins are obtained. During Free Spins, every time a compass appears on the reels, the one on the logo starts to rotate and more matching symbols appear. Based on where the needle stops, all special symbols will expand.\n\nWith 3 Bonus symbols, a special game is activated: the grid is replaced by a wheel divided into 8 sections with 1X multipliers. Every time the wheel stops on a multiplier, it is powered up to 250X. You have 50 wheel spins available, unless the needle stops on the skull symbol, in which case the bonus game ends and you return to the base game.\n            ",
