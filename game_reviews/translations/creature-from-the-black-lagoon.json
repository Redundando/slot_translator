The monster from the lagoon is one of them, a horror that hides in murky lake waters and pulls unsuspecting victims into its depths.\n\nCreature from the Black Lagoon by NetEnt is a slot that will make us relive a classic horror movie about monsters, albeit in a decidedly less philosophical and more entertaining way. Our review of this slot begins with its graphics.\n\nCreature from the Black Lagoon - Graphics\nIf we think of the monster from the lagoon, it is natural that we think of very old black and white films. Creature from the Black Lagoon takes us back to an aesthetic that nods to the 1940s and 1950s films.\n\nIn the background of a water mirror framed by trees and foliage, we find the game grid that looks like a yellowed and folded map. The slot symbols are all dedicated to monster hunting.\n\nKnives, binoculars, old cine cameras, oxygen tanks, as well as several protagonists who embody the stereotypes of these stories: the fearless hero, the sly captain, the beautiful girl, and the old scholar. Accompanying each of our spins, we will hear a song that seems to come from a movie of another time and environmental sounds such as the chirping of birds, the croaking of frogs, and the chirping of crickets.\n\nAll symbols are illustrated in an excellent and full of details way, making the slot already interesting from a graphic and sound point of view. But now let's see if the technical part is at the same level.\n\nCreature of the Black Lagoon - how to survive the monster\nJust a few spins on this slot are enough to see that, behind the image of a traditional slot, there is a slot with decidedly interesting features. The game mechanism is 5*3 type, showing fifteen symbols at each play along the twenty pay lines.\n\nThe symbol of the monster allows us to access the bonus function, which proves to be particularly interactive and fun to play: during the assigned free spins, in fact, we may find a special symbol characterized by a viewfinder.\n\nBy finding a viewfinder, we will have the chance to hit the creature with a harpoon: after three shots, the creature will unlock an additional Wild symbol (i.e., a joker) that will accompany all the others we find. The expansion will become even more marked if we manage to hit the creature again until obtaining some additional free spins when its life bar reaches zero.\n\nAn undoubtedly interesting and fun function, in a world populated by slots in which the player feels like only a spectator.\n\nSlots similar to Creature From the Black Lagoon\nThe theme related to the lagoon monster is quite unique, but there are many other slots that feature various types of monsters such as: Necronomicon, based on the cosmic horrors of Lovecraft, the fun Monster Sushi, Kaiju based on the giant monsters of Japanese cinema or still Luck Ness, on the famous Loch Ness monster.\n            ",

The monster from the lagoon is one of them, a horror that hides in murky lake waters and pulls unsuspecting victims into its depths.\n\nCreature from the Black Lagoon by NetEnt is a slot that will make us relive a classic horror movie about monsters, albeit in a decidedly less philosophical and more entertaining way. Our review of this slot begins with its graphics.\n\nCreature from the Black Lagoon - Graphics\nIf we think of the monster from the lagoon, it is natural that we think of very old black and white films. Creature from the Black Lagoon takes us back to an aesthetic that nods to the 1940s and 1950s films.\n\nIn the background of a water mirror framed by trees and foliage, we find the game grid that looks like a yellowed and folded map. The slot symbols are all dedicated to monster hunting.\n\nKnives, binoculars, old cine cameras, oxygen tanks, as well as several protagonists who embody the stereotypes of these stories: the fearless hero, the sly captain, the beautiful girl, and the old scholar. Accompanying each of our spins, we will hear a song that seems to come from a movie of another time and environmental sounds such as the chirping of birds, the croaking of frogs, and the chirping of crickets.\n\nAll symbols are illustrated in an excellent and full of details way, making the slot already interesting from a graphic and sound point of view. But now let's see if the technical part is at the same level.\n\nCreature of the Black Lagoon - how to survive the monster\nJust a few spins on this slot are enough to see that, behind the image of a traditional slot, there is a slot with decidedly interesting features. The game mechanism is 5*3 type, showing fifteen symbols at each play along the twenty pay lines.\n\nThe symbol of the monster allows us to access the bonus function, which proves to be particularly interactive and fun to play: during the assigned free spins, in fact, we may find a special symbol characterized by a viewfinder.\n\nBy finding a viewfinder, we will have the chance to hit the creature with a harpoon: after three shots, the creature will unlock an additional Wild symbol (i.e., a joker) that will accompany all the others we find. The expansion will become even more marked if we manage to hit the creature again until obtaining some additional free spins when its life bar reaches zero.\n\nAn undoubtedly interesting and fun function, in a world populated by slots in which the player feels like only a spectator.\n\nSlots similar to Creature From the Black Lagoon\nThe theme related to the lagoon monster is quite unique, but there are many other slots that feature various types of monsters such as: Necronomicon, based on the cosmic horrors of Lovecraft, the fun Monster Sushi, Kaiju based on the giant monsters of Japanese cinema or still Luck Ness, on the famous Loch Ness monster.\n            ",

The monster from the lagoon is one of them, a horror that hides in murky lake waters and pulls unsuspecting victims into its depths.\n\nCreature from the Black Lagoon by NetEnt is a slot that will make us relive a classic horror movie about monsters, albeit in a decidedly less philosophical and more entertaining way. Our review of this slot begins with its graphics.\n\nCreature from the Black Lagoon - Graphics\nIf we think of the monster from the lagoon, it is natural that we think of very old black and white films. Creature from the Black Lagoon takes us back to an aesthetic that nods to the 1940s and 1950s films.\n\nIn the background of a water mirror framed by trees and foliage, we find the game grid that looks like a yellowed and folded map. The slot symbols are all dedicated to monster hunting.\n\nKnives, binoculars, old cine cameras, oxygen tanks, as well as several protagonists who embody the stereotypes of these stories: the fearless hero, the sly captain, the beautiful girl, and the old scholar. Accompanying each of our spins, we will hear a song that seems to come from a movie of another time and environmental sounds such as the chirping of birds, the croaking of frogs, and the chirping of crickets.\n\nAll symbols are illustrated in an excellent and full of details way, making the slot already interesting from a graphic and sound point of view. But now let's see if the technical part is at the same level.\n\nCreature of the Black Lagoon - how to survive the monster\nJust a few spins on this slot are enough to see that, behind the image of a traditional slot, there is a slot with decidedly interesting features. The game mechanism is 5*3 type, showing fifteen symbols at each play along the twenty pay lines.\n\nThe symbol of the monster allows us to access the bonus function, which proves to be particularly interactive and fun to play: during the assigned free spins, in fact, we may find a special symbol characterized by a viewfinder.\n\nBy finding a viewfinder, we will have the chance to hit the creature with a harpoon: after three shots, the creature will unlock an additional Wild symbol (i.e., a joker) that will accompany all the others we find. The expansion will become even more marked if we manage to hit the creature again until obtaining some additional free spins when its life bar reaches zero.\n\nAn undoubtedly interesting and fun function, in a world populated by slots in which the player feels like only a spectator.\n\nSlots similar to Creature From the Black Lagoon\nThe theme related to the lagoon monster is quite unique, but there are many other slots that feature various types of monsters such as: Necronomicon, based on the cosmic horrors of Lovecraft, the fun Monster Sushi, Kaiju based on the giant monsters of Japanese cinema or still Luck Ness, on the famous Loch Ness monster.\n            ",
