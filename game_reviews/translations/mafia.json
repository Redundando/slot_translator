Choose the next card in the sequence, be lucky, and you'll double your winnings! At this point, you can claim your winnings or bet everything again to try and get an even bigger prize.\nAlthough it may seem a little unexciting to some, many players will love what the Mafia online slot has to offer. Gambling is a nice addition for those who want a little more from their slots. However, this game has some great winning opportunities for anyone who's happy to sit back and let the slot do all the work.

Well-known in the industry for its unique innovation strength, Novomatic has applied its level of casino gaming expertise to this title.\n\nKeeping in line with minimal bonus features, the Mafia online slot has maintained simple yet interesting graphics. The symbols include a pile of money, a fedora hat, a pair of dice, some bullets, sunglasses, a diamond, and a gun. The game's scatter symbol is a silver M.\n\nThe betting system for the Mafia online slot game is easy to manage, whether you're a seasoned online slot player or playing for the first time. It's divided into three components. First, you need to select how many of the 10 paylines you want to bet on. Then, select how many times you want to bet per line, up to a maximum of 10. Then, select a value for these credits.\n\nAll of these controls are located on the ribbon at the bottom of the reels. You can play around with them to get almost any desired values, with a minimum bet of 1 credit and a maximum of 100. \n\nIf you want to spin multiple times with just the press of a button, you can do so thanks to the Mafia slot machine's autoplay function. Most slot games require you to choose how many spins you want to play, but not Mafia. When you use autoplay in this game, it will continue until you turn it off or until your credits run out.\n\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nWhile bonuses may be few in the Mafia online slot, that doesn't mean you won't have fun playing.\n\nFirst off is the feature to bet both ways. It doesn't matter if the winning symbols go from left to right or the other way around; both count as wins!\n\nSecondly, landing three or more M symbols anywhere on the reels will trigger a scatter payout. These are fantastic extra bonuses to collect while spinning. They are also accompanied by a great little animation where the symbol will be riddled with bullets.\n\nThe final bonus in the Mafia slot machine is the gambling feature, the famous Gamble of traditional slots. If you have a win you're particularly proud of, why not try to increase it a bit more? The gambling button opens a simple game of red or black. Choose the next card in the sequence, be lucky, and double your payout! At this point, you can claim the win or bet it all again to try for an even bigger prize.\n\nWhile some may find it less exciting, many players will love what the Mafia online slot has to offer. The gambling feature is a great addition for those who want a little more from their slots. However, this game has some great winning possibilities for anyone who's happy to sit back and let the slot do all the work. For all gangster or mafia enthusiasts, this slot should be a must-play!\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nWhen playing the Mafia online slot, you may be reminded of some other games. Gangsters and casinos have gone together for years, so it's no surprise that there are several other slots you could try.\n\nThe Playson-produced Slot Machine called Chicago Gangsters is a slot with melancholic 1920s colors that will take you back to Prohibition-era Chicago when even having a drink meant committing a crime. The mystery symbol bonus can get you a big win on any random spin. The poker chip bonus gives you respins as you try to land 15 chips to fill the board. Do it and you'll win a 1000x jackpot.\n\nYou could also take a spin on The Untouchables by Betsson Group. This fun cartoon-style slot is another interpretation of the Prohibition era and features characters like Don Cappone. Try to grab a massive win right under the Don's nose in his instant win bonus or take a spin of free spins with wild reels."

With its snap reels and simple gameplay mechanics, this slot is perfect for anyone who prefers a straightforward experience. Who needs wild bonus games when it's just you and the reels?\nThis game has scatter pay, betting, a gambling feature, and that's it. It's wonderfully clean. It's the perfect slot for anyone who prefers to focus on the game instead of dealing with some of the crazy gameplay mechanics out there.\nCurious to see what kind of offers the Mafia slot machine has that you just can't refuse? Keep reading our review to learn more about this game!\nGangster Graphics\nThis simple but fun slot has been brought to you by Austrian developer Novomatic. Known in the industry for its unique innovative strength, Novomatic has applied its level of casino game expertise to this title.\nIn line with the minimum bonus features, the Mafia online slot has kept its graphics simple yet interesting. The symbols include a bundle of money, a fedora, a pair of dice, some bullets, some sunglasses, a diamond, and a gun. The game's scatter symbol is a silver M.\nThe betting system for the Mafia online slot is easy to handle, whether you're an old hand at online slots or this is your first game. It's divided into three components. First, you need to select how many of the 10 paylines you're going to bet on. Then you select how many times you want to bet per line up to a maximum of 10. Then you select a value for these credits.\nAll of these controls are found on the ribbon at the bottom of the reels. You can play around with them to get almost any desired values, with a minimum bet of 1 credit and a maximum of 100.\nIf you want to spin more times with just the click of a button, you can do it thanks to the Mafia slot machine's autoplay feature. Most slot games require you to choose how many spins they want you to play. This is not the case with Mafia. When you use autoplay in this game, it will continue until you turn it off or until your credit is depleted.\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe bonuses may be few in the Mafia online slot, but that doesn't mean you won't have fun playing.\nThe first point is the feature of betting both ways.

These are fantastic extra bonuses to collect while spinning. They are also accompanied by a small great animation where the symbol will be riddled with bullets.\nThe final bonus in the Mafia slot machine is the gambling feature, the famous Gamble of traditional slots. If you have a win that you are particularly proud of, why not try to increase it a little more? The gambling button opens up a simple game of red or black. Choose the next card in the sequence, be lucky, and you'll double your winnings! At this point, you can claim your winnings or bet everything again to try and get an even bigger prize.\nAlthough it may seem a little unexciting to some, many players will love what the Mafia online slot has to offer. Gambling is a nice addition for those who want a little more from their slots. However, this game has some great winning opportunities for anyone who's happy to sit back and let the slot do all the work.

With its snap reels and simple gameplay mechanics, this slot is perfect for anyone who prefers a straightforward experience. Who needs wild bonus games when it's just you and the reels?\nThis game has scatter pay, betting, a gambling feature, and that's it. It's wonderfully clean. It's the perfect slot for anyone who prefers to focus on the game instead of dealing with some of the crazy gameplay mechanics out there.\nCurious to see what kind of offers the Mafia slot machine has that you just can't refuse? Keep reading our review to learn more about this game!\nGangster Graphics\nThis simple but fun slot has been brought to you by Austrian developer Novomatic. Known in the industry for its unique innovative strength, Novomatic has applied its level of casino game expertise to this title.\nIn line with the minimum bonus features, the Mafia online slot has kept its graphics simple yet interesting. The symbols include a bundle of money, a fedora, a pair of dice, some bullets, some sunglasses, a diamond, and a gun. The game's scatter symbol is a silver M.\nThe betting system for the Mafia online slot is easy to handle, whether you're an old hand at online slots or this is your first game. It's divided into three components. First, you need to select how many of the 10 paylines you're going to bet on. Then you select how many times you want to bet per line up to a maximum of 10. Then you select a value for these credits.\nAll of these controls are found on the ribbon at the bottom of the reels. You can play around with them to get almost any desired values, with a minimum bet of 1 credit and a maximum of 100.\nIf you want to spin more times with just the click of a button, you can do it thanks to the Mafia slot machine's autoplay feature. Most slot games require you to choose how many spins they want you to play. This is not the case with Mafia. When you use autoplay in this game, it will continue until you turn it off or until your credit is depleted.\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe bonuses may be few in the Mafia online slot, but that doesn't mean you won't have fun playing.\nThe first point is the feature of betting both ways. It doesn't matter if the winning symbols go from left to right on the reels or vice versa; both will count as wins!\nSecondly, landing three or more M symbols anywhere on the reels for a scatter payout. These are fantastic extra bonuses to collect while spinning. They are also accompanied by a small great animation where the symbol will be riddled with bullets.\nThe final bonus in the Mafia slot machine is the gambling feature, the famous Gamble of traditional slots. If you have a win that you are particularly proud of, why not try to increase it a little more? The gambling button opens up a simple game of red or black. Choose the next card in the sequence, be lucky, and you'll double your winnings! At this point, you can claim your winnings or bet everything again to try and get an even bigger prize.\nAlthough it may seem a little unexciting to some, many players will love what the Mafia online slot has to offer. Gambling is a nice addition for those who want a little more from their slots. However, this game has some great winning opportunities for anyone who's happy to sit back and let the slot do all the work. For all gangster or mafia enthusiasts, this slot should be a must-play!\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nWhen you play the Mafia slot online, you may remember some other games. Gangsters and casinos have gone hand in hand for years, so it's no surprise that there are several other slots you could try.\nThe slot machine produced by Playson and called Chicago Gangsters is a slot with melancholy colors of the 1920s ready to take you back to Prohibition-era Chicago when even drinking alcohol was a crime.

Do it and you'll win a jackpot worth 1000x your bet.\nYou might also check out The Untouchables by Betsson Group.

You can choose your bet depending on how many of the ten paylines you intend to bet on, how much you want to bet per line up to a maximum of 10, and the credits' value. This simple betting ribbon is located at the bottom of the reels. The minimum bet is one credit, while the maximum bet is 100 credits.\n\nBet Both Ways\n\nOne of the Mafia slot game's most impressive features is the bet-both-ways option. It doesn't matter whether winning symbols appear from left to right on the reels or vice versa; you'll still receive payouts.\n\nScatter Payout\n\nPlayers can earn scatter bonuses by landing three or more scatter symbols, represented by a silver 'M,' anywhere on the reels. While the payoff isn't huge, the explosion animation associated with it adds to the game's excitement.\n\nGambling Feature\n\nThe Mafia online slot game includes just one bonus feature: the gambling feature. This traditional slot game feature allows you to play a simple game of red or black. If you succeed in selecting the correct card in the sequence, your earnings are doubled. You can claim your reward and end the mini-game or risk it all again to double it several times over.\n\nBonus Features\n\nMafia slots have relatively few bonus features compared to other slot games. However, the features provided are enough for players to enjoy the game fully. The betting system, scatter payout, bet-both-ways option, and gambling feature are all engaging and entertaining.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nSuppose you enjoyed playing Mafia slots and would like to explore similar games. In that case, you could try playing the Chicago Gangsters slot game produced by Playson and The Untouchables by Betsson Group. Both games feature the prohibition era and the world of organized crime in Chicago. They provide exciting bonus features that Mafia slots lack but still maintain the simplicity and exciting graphics of Mafia slots.\n\n        \n            ",

With its snap reels and simple gameplay mechanics, this slot is perfect for anyone who prefers a straightforward experience. Who needs wild bonus games when it's just you and the reels?\nThis game has scatter pay, betting, a gambling feature, and that's it. It's wonderfully clean. It's the perfect slot for anyone who prefers to focus on the game instead of dealing with some of the crazy gameplay mechanics out there.\nCurious to see what kind of offers the Mafia slot machine has that you just can't refuse? Keep reading our review to learn more about this game!\nGangster Graphics\nThis simple but fun slot has been brought to you by Austrian developer Novomatic. Known in the industry for its unique innovative strength, Novomatic has applied its level of casino game expertise to this title.\nIn line with the minimum bonus features, the Mafia online slot has kept its graphics simple yet interesting. The symbols include a bundle of money, a fedora, a pair of dice, some bullets, some sunglasses, a diamond, and a gun. The game's scatter symbol is a silver M.\nThe betting system for the Mafia online slot is easy to handle, whether you're an old hand at online slots or this is your first game. It's divided into three components. First, you need to select how many of the 10 paylines you're going to bet on. Then you select how many times you want to bet per line up to a maximum of 10. Then you select a value for these credits.\nAll of these controls are found on the ribbon at the bottom of the reels. You can play around with them to get almost any desired values, with a minimum bet of 1 credit and a maximum of 100.\nIf you want to spin more times with just the click of a button, you can do it thanks to the Mafia slot machine's autoplay feature. Most slot games require you to choose how many spins they want you to play. This is not the case with Mafia. When you use autoplay in this game, it will continue until you turn it off or until your credit is depleted.\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe bonuses may be few in the Mafia online slot, but that doesn't mean you won't have fun playing.\nThe first point is the feature of betting both ways. It doesn't matter if the winning symbols go from left to right on the reels or vice versa; both will count as wins!\nSecondly, landing three or more M symbols anywhere on the reels for a scatter payout. These are fantastic extra bonuses to collect while spinning. They are also accompanied by a small great animation where the symbol will be riddled with bullets.\nThe final bonus in the Mafia slot machine is the gambling feature, the famous Gamble of traditional slots. If you have a win that you are particularly proud of, why not try to increase it a little more? The gambling button opens up a simple game of red or black. Choose the next card in the sequence, be lucky, and you'll double your winnings! At this point, you can claim your winnings or bet everything again to try and get an even bigger prize.\nAlthough it may seem a little unexciting to some, many players will love what the Mafia online slot has to offer. Gambling is a nice addition for those who want a little more from their slots. However, this game has some great winning opportunities for anyone who's happy to sit back and let the slot do all the work. For all gangster or mafia enthusiasts, this slot should be a must-play!\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nWhen you play the Mafia slot online, you may remember some other games. Gangsters and casinos have gone hand in hand for years, so it's no surprise that there are several other slots you could try.\nThe slot machine produced by Playson and called Chicago Gangsters is a slot with melancholy colors of the 1920s ready to take you back to Prohibition-era Chicago when even drinking alcohol was a crime. The Mystery symbol bonus can land you a big win on any random spin. The poker chip bonus spin gives you respins after respins as you try to land 15 chips to fill the board. Do it and you'll win a jackpot worth 1000x your bet.\nYou might also check out The Untouchables by Betsson Group. This fun cartoon-style slot is another interpretation of the Prohibition era and features characters like Don Cappone. Try to grab a massive win from under Don's nose himself in his instant win bonus or take a free spin with wild reels.\n            ",

With its snap reels and simple gameplay mechanics, this slot is perfect for anyone who prefers a straightforward experience. Who needs wild bonus games when it's just you and the reels?\nThis game has scatter pay, betting, a gambling feature, and that's it. It's wonderfully clean. It's the perfect slot for anyone who prefers to focus on the game instead of dealing with some of the crazy gameplay mechanics out there.\nCurious to see what kind of offers the Mafia slot machine has that you just can't refuse? Keep reading our review to learn more about this game!\nGangster Graphics\nThis simple but fun slot has been brought to you by Austrian developer Novomatic. Known in the industry for its unique innovative strength, Novomatic has applied its level of casino game expertise to this title.\nIn line with the minimum bonus features, the Mafia online slot has kept its graphics simple yet interesting. The symbols include a bundle of money, a fedora, a pair of dice, some bullets, some sunglasses, a diamond, and a gun. The game's scatter symbol is a silver M.\nThe betting system for the Mafia online slot is easy to handle, whether you're an old hand at online slots or this is your first game. It's divided into three components. First, you need to select how many of the 10 paylines you're going to bet on. Then you select how many times you want to bet per line up to a maximum of 10. Then you select a value for these credits.\nAll of these controls are found on the ribbon at the bottom of the reels. You can play around with them to get almost any desired values, with a minimum bet of 1 credit and a maximum of 100.\nIf you want to spin more times with just the click of a button, you can do it thanks to the Mafia slot machine's autoplay feature. Most slot games require you to choose how many spins they want you to play. This is not the case with Mafia. When you use autoplay in this game, it will continue until you turn it off or until your credit is depleted.\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe bonuses may be few in the Mafia online slot, but that doesn't mean you won't have fun playing.\nThe first point is the feature of betting both ways. It doesn't matter if the winning symbols go from left to right on the reels or vice versa; both will count as wins!\nSecondly, landing three or more M symbols anywhere on the reels for a scatter payout. These are fantastic extra bonuses to collect while spinning. They are also accompanied by a small great animation where the symbol will be riddled with bullets.\nThe final bonus in the Mafia slot machine is the gambling feature, the famous Gamble of traditional slots. If you have a win that you are particularly proud of, why not try to increase it a little more? The gambling button opens up a simple game of red or black. Choose the next card in the sequence, be lucky, and you'll double your winnings! At this point, you can claim your winnings or bet everything again to try and get an even bigger prize.\nAlthough it may seem a little unexciting to some, many players will love what the Mafia online slot has to offer. Gambling is a nice addition for those who want a little more from their slots. However, this game has some great winning opportunities for anyone who's happy to sit back and let the slot do all the work. For all gangster or mafia enthusiasts, this slot should be a must-play!\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nWhen you play the Mafia slot online, you may remember some other games. Gangsters and casinos have gone hand in hand for years, so it's no surprise that there are several other slots you could try.\nThe slot machine produced by Playson and called Chicago Gangsters is a slot with melancholy colors of the 1920s ready to take you back to Prohibition-era Chicago when even drinking alcohol was a crime. The Mystery symbol bonus can land you a big win on any random spin. The poker chip bonus spin gives you respins after respins as you try to land 15 chips to fill the board. Do it and you'll win a jackpot worth 1000x your bet.\nYou might also check out The Untouchables by Betsson Group. This fun cartoon-style slot is another interpretation of the Prohibition era and features characters like Don Cappone. Try to grab a massive win from under Don's nose himself in his instant win bonus or take a free spin with wild reels.\n            ",
