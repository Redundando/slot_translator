I protagonisti del gioco sono dei personaggi molto ben definiti e riprodotti realisticamente, mentre lo sfondo ci porta dritti in una Londra spettrale e contribuisce a creare un’atmosfera di gioco assai intrigante e coinvolgente.\nCerto, siamo lontani dalle grafiche ipertecnologiche in 3D, ma possiamo dire che A Night of Mystery non lascia insoddisfatti, anzi, ci piace come il tema è stato sviluppato e come riesca a catturare l’interesse del giocatore.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot\nA Night of Mystery propone a tutti gli Sherlock Holmes all’ascolto un gioco caratterizzato dalla tradizionale struttura a cinque rulli con 40 linee di pagamento, accessibile non solo da computer desktop (Mac inclusi) ma anche da tutte le tipologie di dispositivi mobili.\nLe linee di pagamento sono 40, sulle quali è possibile scommettere da un minimo di 40 centesimi fino a un massimo di ben 400 €, con valore del gettone compreso tra 1 centesimo e 10 €. Questo range di puntate così ampio farà contenti sia i giocatori casuali che non amano investire grandi somme, sia gli high rollers che al contrario cercano il brivido dell’adrenalina puntando cifre consistenti.\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP) di A Night of Mystery si attesta su un canonico e abbastanza soddisfacente 96%.\nSimboli e funzionalità di A Night of Mystery\nIn A Night of Mystery le protagoniste, indiziate dell’omicidio, sono quattro ballerine di burlesque, che rappresentano anche i simboli con valore più alto. I simboli non tematici sono invece i numeri e le lettere che si riferiscono alle carte da gioco dal 10 all’Asso e sono quelli che pagano di meno.\nOltre a questi simboli regolari, ne troviamo degli altri speciali: il Wild, che è il logo del gioco, ha funzione di jolly e può sostituire tutte le altre icone per realizzare una combinazione vincente; il logo Free Games è invece lo Scatter e se compare per almeno tre volte permette di accedere alla funzione Free Spins, che offre un numero di giri gratis a partire da 9.\nNon sono presenti della altre funzionalità speciali, il gameplay di A Night of Mystery è davvero ridotto all’essenziale, ma troviamo che le possibilità di vincita, soprattutto se si scommette la cifra massima consentita, siano davvero interessanti e che valga la pena provare a giocare a questa slot.\n",

The paylines are 40, on which you can bet from a minimum of 40 cents up to a maximum of €400, with the coin value ranging from 1 cent to €10. This wide range of bets will make both casual players who do not like to invest large sums and high rollers who, on the contrary, seek the thrill of adrenaline by betting substantial amounts, happy.\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of \"A Night of Mystery\" is a canonical and fairly satisfactory 96%.\n\nIn \"A Night of Mystery\", the protagonists, accused of murder, are four burlesque dancers who also represent the symbols with the highest value.

Although their slot machines are decent, we rarely find a spark of originality or innovative gameplay as they almost always offer games with dry lines and very simple gameplay modes.\n\nAt least, when it comes to graphics and theme, \"A Night of Mystery\" is a pleasant novelty: the theme is that of unsolved murders and takes place on a set that closely resembles the well-known board game Cluedo. The game's characters are very well-defined and realistically reproduced, while the background takes us straight to a ghostly London and contributes to creating a very intriguing and engaging game atmosphere.\n\nOf course, we are far from hyper-technological 3D graphics, but we can say that \"A Night of Mystery\" does not disappoint. On the contrary, we like how the theme has been developed and how it manages to capture the player's interest.\n\nThe main features of the slot include a traditional five-reel structure with 40 paylines, accessible not only from desktop computers (including Mac), but also from all types of mobile devices. The paylines are 40, on which you can bet from a minimum of 40 cents up to a maximum of €400, with the coin value ranging from 1 cent to €10. This wide range of bets will make both casual players who do not like to invest large sums and high rollers who, on the contrary, seek the thrill of adrenaline by betting substantial amounts, happy.\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of \"A Night of Mystery\" is a canonical and fairly satisfactory 96%.\n\nIn \"A Night of Mystery\", the protagonists, accused of murder, are four burlesque dancers who also represent the symbols with the highest value. The non-thematic symbols are the numbers and letters that refer to playing cards from 10 to Ace and are the ones that pay the least.\n\nIn addition to these regular symbols, there are also special ones: the Wild, which is the game logo, functions as a wild card and can replace all other icons to make a winning combination; the Free Games logo is instead the Scatter, and if it appears at least three times, it allows access to the Free Spins feature, which offers a number of free spins starting from 9. \n\nThere are no other special features, the gameplay of \"A Night of Mystery\" is really reduced to the essential, but we find that the winnings opportunities, especially if betting the maximum amount allowed, are really interesting and worth trying your luck at this slot game.\n            ",

Although their slot machines are decent, we rarely find a spark of originality or innovative gameplay as they almost always offer games with dry lines and very simple gameplay modes.\n\nAt least, when it comes to graphics and theme, \"A Night of Mystery\" is a pleasant novelty: the theme is that of unsolved murders and takes place on a set that closely resembles the well-known board game Cluedo. The game's characters are very well-defined and realistically reproduced, while the background takes us straight to a ghostly London and contributes to creating a very intriguing and engaging game atmosphere.\n\nOf course, we are far from hyper-technological 3D graphics, but we can say that \"A Night of Mystery\" does not disappoint. On the contrary, we like how the theme has been developed and how it manages to capture the player's interest.\n\nThe main features of the slot include a traditional five-reel structure with 40 paylines, accessible not only from desktop computers (including Mac), but also from all types of mobile devices. The paylines are 40, on which you can bet from a minimum of 40 cents up to a maximum of €400, with the coin value ranging from 1 cent to €10. This wide range of bets will make both casual players who do not like to invest large sums and high rollers who, on the contrary, seek the thrill of adrenaline by betting substantial amounts, happy.\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of \"A Night of Mystery\" is a canonical and fairly satisfactory 96%.\n\nIn \"A Night of Mystery\", the protagonists, accused of murder, are four burlesque dancers who also represent the symbols with the highest value. The non-thematic symbols are the numbers and letters that refer to playing cards from 10 to Ace and are the ones that pay the least.\n\nIn addition to these regular symbols, there are also special ones: the Wild, which is the game logo, functions as a wild card and can replace all other icons to make a winning combination; the Free Games logo is instead the Scatter, and if it appears at least three times, it allows access to the Free Spins feature, which offers a number of free spins starting from 9. \n\nThere are no other special features, the gameplay of \"A Night of Mystery\" is really reduced to the essential, but we find that the winnings opportunities, especially if betting the maximum amount allowed, are really interesting and worth trying your luck at this slot game.\n            ",
