The symbols used are also genius, with caricatures of iconic characters like Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, Henry VIII, Florence Nightingale, and William Shakespeare.\n\nHow is Down the Rails made?\nThe game grid is classic, with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 fixed pay lines, on which you can bet a minimum of €0.20 and a maximum of €100. The Autoplay system is present, which can be set with win limits beyond which the mode stops. The volatility is high, while the RTP value is 95.58%.\n\nLots of Bonuses!\n\nIn Down the Rails, we have three main categories of symbols: low level, high level, and bonus. The first group includes playing cards from J to Ace, while in the second, we find Newton, Nightingale, Shakespeare, Churchill, and Henry VIII. As for the special symbols, we have Wild, Scatter, and additional bonus symbols.\n\nThe Wild substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter and other bonus symbols. The carriage is the Scatter and when three or more appear on the reels, we are randomly assigned one of the 4 functions listed below:\n\nPentonville: five free spins are obtained, and every time a winning combination appears, that group of paying symbols is marked and remains fixed on the screen, generating new combinations on the next spins.\n\nKing Cross: here too we get five free spins. The center reel is marked with a cross, and every time a Wild stops in the center, the other symbols within the cross also become Wild.\n\nBuckingham Palace: we get eight free spins, with a Wild that expands across the entire reel every time it appears.\n\nCanary Wharf: a golden box appears on the grid and collects the sums indicated in the most lucrative symbols.\n\nIn addition to these, always with the Bonus function, we can obtain the End of the Line Bonus game, which has these features: it gives three Respins, blocks cash prizes on the grid, grants extra lives, increases the value of symbols, expands the reels, and adds multipliers. During the base game, five different functions can be randomly activated:\n\nTunnel Vision: mysterious symbols are added to the reels and transform into one of the most lucrative symbols.\n\nThe Big Smoke: a 3×3 Wild is added to the grid.\n\nWild Strike: random Wilds are added.\n\nShifting Stack: a new expanding Wild is added to the reels.\n\nBonus Blitz: randomly assigns the bonus feature.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nWhy choose Down the Rails?\nBecause it is a slot full of bonuses and surprises, with excellent RTP and high-level prizes.\n\nWhere can I find Down the Rails?\nIn all the most famous online casinos with AAMS/ADM certification.\n\nCan I play on my tablet?\nCertainly, Down the Rails is available on both PC and portable devices.\n            ",

The graphics are detailed and the choice of theme, the London subway, is commendable. Iconic characters like Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, Henry VIII, Florence Nightingale, and William Shakespeare are also portrayed through caricatures in the game.\n\nSymbols and Bonuses\n\nDown the Rails has three main categories of symbols: low level, high level, and bonus. The Wild symbol can substitute for all the other symbols except for the Scatter and bonus symbols. The carriage represents the Scatter, and landing three or more of them triggers one of the four different bonus games: Pentonville, King Cross, Buckingham Palace, and Canary Wharf. Additionally, the End of the Line Bonus game is available, which offers three Respins, cash prizes, extra lives, symbol value increases, expanding reels, and multipliers. There are also random functions available during the base game, such as Tunnel Vision, The Big Smoke, Wild Strike, Shifting Stack, and Bonus Blitz.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\n\nDown the Rails has a classic game grid with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 fixed pay lines. The Autoplay function is available and can be customized with win limits. The game has high volatility and an RTP value of 95.58%.\n\nBetting Options\n\nBets can be made with a minimum of €0.20 and a maximum of €100.\n\nDevice Compatibility\n\nDown the Rails is available on both PC and portable devices, including tablets. The game can be found in all the most famous online casinos with AAMS/ADM certification.\n\n        \n            ",

The symbols used are also genius, with caricatures of iconic characters like Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, Henry VIII, Florence Nightingale, and William Shakespeare.\n\nHow is Down the Rails made?\nThe game grid is classic, with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 fixed pay lines, on which you can bet a minimum of €0.20 and a maximum of €100. The Autoplay system is present, which can be set with win limits beyond which the mode stops. The volatility is high, while the RTP value is 95.58%.\n\nLots of Bonuses!\n\nIn Down the Rails, we have three main categories of symbols: low level, high level, and bonus. The first group includes playing cards from J to Ace, while in the second, we find Newton, Nightingale, Shakespeare, Churchill, and Henry VIII. As for the special symbols, we have Wild, Scatter, and additional bonus symbols.\n\nThe Wild substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter and other bonus symbols. The carriage is the Scatter and when three or more appear on the reels, we are randomly assigned one of the 4 functions listed below:\n\nPentonville: five free spins are obtained, and every time a winning combination appears, that group of paying symbols is marked and remains fixed on the screen, generating new combinations on the next spins.\n\nKing Cross: here too we get five free spins. The center reel is marked with a cross, and every time a Wild stops in the center, the other symbols within the cross also become Wild.\n\nBuckingham Palace: we get eight free spins, with a Wild that expands across the entire reel every time it appears.\n\nCanary Wharf: a golden box appears on the grid and collects the sums indicated in the most lucrative symbols.\n\nIn addition to these, always with the Bonus function, we can obtain the End of the Line Bonus game, which has these features: it gives three Respins, blocks cash prizes on the grid, grants extra lives, increases the value of symbols, expands the reels, and adds multipliers. During the base game, five different functions can be randomly activated:\n\nTunnel Vision: mysterious symbols are added to the reels and transform into one of the most lucrative symbols.\n\nThe Big Smoke: a 3×3 Wild is added to the grid.\n\nWild Strike: random Wilds are added.\n\nShifting Stack: a new expanding Wild is added to the reels.\n\nBonus Blitz: randomly assigns the bonus feature.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nWhy choose Down the Rails?\nBecause it is a slot full of bonuses and surprises, with excellent RTP and high-level prizes.\n\nWhere can I find Down the Rails?\nIn all the most famous online casinos with AAMS/ADM certification.\n\nCan I play on my tablet?\nCertainly, Down the Rails is available on both PC and portable devices.\n            ",

The symbols used are also genius, with caricatures of iconic characters like Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, Henry VIII, Florence Nightingale, and William Shakespeare.\n\nHow is Down the Rails made?\nThe game grid is classic, with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 20 fixed pay lines, on which you can bet a minimum of €0.20 and a maximum of €100. The Autoplay system is present, which can be set with win limits beyond which the mode stops. The volatility is high, while the RTP value is 95.58%.\n\nLots of Bonuses!\n\nIn Down the Rails, we have three main categories of symbols: low level, high level, and bonus. The first group includes playing cards from J to Ace, while in the second, we find Newton, Nightingale, Shakespeare, Churchill, and Henry VIII. As for the special symbols, we have Wild, Scatter, and additional bonus symbols.\n\nThe Wild substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter and other bonus symbols. The carriage is the Scatter and when three or more appear on the reels, we are randomly assigned one of the 4 functions listed below:\n\nPentonville: five free spins are obtained, and every time a winning combination appears, that group of paying symbols is marked and remains fixed on the screen, generating new combinations on the next spins.\n\nKing Cross: here too we get five free spins. The center reel is marked with a cross, and every time a Wild stops in the center, the other symbols within the cross also become Wild.\n\nBuckingham Palace: we get eight free spins, with a Wild that expands across the entire reel every time it appears.\n\nCanary Wharf: a golden box appears on the grid and collects the sums indicated in the most lucrative symbols.\n\nIn addition to these, always with the Bonus function, we can obtain the End of the Line Bonus game, which has these features: it gives three Respins, blocks cash prizes on the grid, grants extra lives, increases the value of symbols, expands the reels, and adds multipliers. During the base game, five different functions can be randomly activated:\n\nTunnel Vision: mysterious symbols are added to the reels and transform into one of the most lucrative symbols.\n\nThe Big Smoke: a 3×3 Wild is added to the grid.\n\nWild Strike: random Wilds are added.\n\nShifting Stack: a new expanding Wild is added to the reels.\n\nBonus Blitz: randomly assigns the bonus feature.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nWhy choose Down the Rails?\nBecause it is a slot full of bonuses and surprises, with excellent RTP and high-level prizes.\n\nWhere can I find Down the Rails?\nIn all the most famous online casinos with AAMS/ADM certification.\n\nCan I play on my tablet?\nCertainly, Down the Rails is available on both PC and portable devices.\n        ",
