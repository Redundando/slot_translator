Di sicuro vi scapperebbe un sorriso come successo a noi. Ecco, Bad Granny, la nuova slot del provider Espresso, è tutta improntata sulla comicità di questo insolito e stravagante personaggio!\nL’ilarità si respira a partire dalla grafica utilizzata, che riprende lo stile dei cartoni animati, e da un simpatico motivetto che sfidiamo chiunque a non fischiettare dopo appena cinque minuti di gioco!\nSulla parte destra della griglia troviamo l’entrata di casa della nostra protagonista, mentre il resto della schermata è dedicata ai rulli. In basso troviamo la consolle che ci permette di settare al meglio la nostra giocata e di accedere al meno interno dove tra le altre cose, possiamo visionare le regole del gioco.\nCaratteristiche di Bad Granny\nLa griglia di gioco è di forma quadrata, con 5 rulli e 5 righe, su cui si dipanano 32 linee di pagamento fisse. Lo scopo del gioco è di associare una combinazione vincente di simboli a partire dal primo rullo di sinistra e procedendo verso destra. Per variare la puntata è necessario modificare gli STEP. Le puntate sono in gettoni e ognuno di essi vale 0,01 €. Attraverso il tasto apposito, si possono impostare tre diversi livelli di velocità e con il tasto AUTO si dà avvio ai giri automatici.  Il pulsante MAX serve per avere la puntata massima in un colpo solo. Il ritorno teorico al giocatore RTP è pari al 92,89%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nI simboli di Bad Granny sono i gomitoli di lana colorati, il borsellino, la tazza di tè con i biscotti, le ciabatte e il bicchiere con la dentiera all’interno.\nLa nonnina è il nostro simbolo Wild e sostituisce tutti i simboli nel completamento di una combinazione vincente.\nLa scritta Super Wild è un Jolly speciale che può apparire solo sul rullo centrale e ci regala un moltiplicatore x3.\nLa vecchietta vestita di nero stile Diabolik è invece il nostro Scatter: 3 o più simboli in qualsiasi posizione sui rulli. ci ricompensa con un moltiplicatore x5, x20 o x100.\nLa scritta Free Spins appare solo sui rulli 1, 2 e 3: quando compaiono, partono i giri gratuiti e se la nonnina riuscirà a mettere a segno la rapina, allora riceveremo un moltiplicatore e un free spin extra gratuito, sino a un massimo di 100. Se invece la nonnina fallisce e scatta l’allarme, perderemo uno dei nostri giri gratis.\nUn altro Bonus è quello denominato Piggy Banks, rappresentato da un salvadanaio dorato a forma di maialino: 3 di questi simboli fanno partire la giocata in cui il nostro compito sarà cliccare sui maialini e scoprire i moltiplicatori ottenuti!\n",

The aim of the game is to match a winning combination of symbols starting from the first left-hand reel and proceeding to the right. Players can vary their bet by modifying the STEPS, with each token worth €0.01. The game offers three different speed levels, the AUTO button for automatic spins, and the MAX button for setting the maximum bet in one shot.\n\nSymbols and Bonuses\n\nThe symbols in Bad Granny include colored balls of wool, a purse, a teacup with biscuits, slippers, a glass with dentures inside and the granny herself, who is the wild symbol. The Super Wild sign is a special wild, appearing only on the central reel, and gives a x3 multiplier. The old lady dressed in black like Diabolik is the scatter symbol and rewards players with a x5, x20 or x100 multiplier if three or more symbols appear in any position on the reel. The Free Spins sign, which appears only on reels 1, 2 and 3, triggers the free spins round. During this round, if the granny manages to pull off a heist, players receive a multiplier and an extra free spin, up to a maximum of 100. If the granny fails and the alarm goes off, players lose one of their free spins. Another Bonus is called Piggy Banks, represented by a golden piggy bank. Three of these symbols start the game in which players must click on the piggy banks and discover the obtained multipliers!\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nThe graphics of Bad Granny employ a cartoon style, making the game look light-hearted and entertaining. The catchy little tune played in the background adds to the humor of the game, and players are sure to love it. The game grid takes up most of the screen, with the entrance to the granny's house on the right side of the grid.\n\nBetting Options\n\nPlayers can vary their bet in Bad Granny by modifying the STEPS, with each token worth €0.01. There are three different speed levels, and the AUTO button provides an option for automatic spins. Players can also use the MAX button to set the maximum bet in one shot.\n\nReturn to Player\n\nBad Granny has a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 92.89%. It's important to note that this value is theoretical and based on long-term play, and actual returns may vary in the short term. The RTP means that for every 100 tokens placed in the game, on average, players can expect to win back 92.89 tokens.\n\n        \n            ",

At the bottom, we find the console that allows us to optimize our bet and access the internal menu where, among other things, we can view the game rules.\n\nFeatures of Bad Granny\nThe game grid is square, with 5 reels and 5 rows, on which 32 fixed paylines unfold. The objective of the game is to match a winning combination of symbols starting from the first left-hand reel and proceeding to the right. To vary the bet, it is necessary to modify the STEPS.

That's Bad Granny, the new slot game from Espresso, based entirely on the humor of this unusual and eccentric character!\n\nThe hilarity begins with the graphics, which employ a cartoon style, and a catchy little tune that we challenge anyone not to whistle after just five minutes of play! On the right side of the grid, we find the entrance to our protagonist's house, while the rest of the screen is dedicated to the reels. At the bottom, we find the console that allows us to optimize our bet and access the internal menu where, among other things, we can view the game rules.\n\nFeatures of Bad Granny\nThe game grid is square, with 5 reels and 5 rows, on which 32 fixed paylines unfold. The objective of the game is to match a winning combination of symbols starting from the first left-hand reel and proceeding to the right. To vary the bet, it is necessary to modify the STEPS. The bets are in tokens, and each of them is worth €0.01. By pressing the appropriate button, three different speed levels can be set, and with the AUTO button, the automatic spins start. The MAX button sets the maximum bet in one shot. The theoretical return to player RTP is 92.89%.\n\nSymbols and functionality\nThe symbols of Bad Granny are colored balls of wool, a purse, a teacup with biscuits, slippers and a glass with dentures inside. The granny is our wild symbol and replaces all symbols in completing a winning combination. The Super Wild sign is a special wild that can appear only on the central reel and gives us a x3 multiplier. The old lady dressed in black like Diabolik is instead our scatter symbol. Three or more symbols in any position on the reel reward us with a x5, x20 or x100 multiplier. The Free Spins sign appears only on reels 1, 2 and 3. When they appear, the free spins start, and if the granny manages to pull off a heist, we receive a multiplier and an extra free spin, up to a maximum of 100. If the granny fails and the alarm goes off, we lose one of our free spins. Another Bonus is called Piggy Banks, represented by a golden piggy bank. Three of these symbols start the game in which our task will be to click on the piggy banks and discover the obtained multipliers!\n            ",
