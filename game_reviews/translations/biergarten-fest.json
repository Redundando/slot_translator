La macchinetta strizza l’occhio a un altro classico con questa tema, ovvero Heidi e Hanna’s Bier Hause, e ci pone al centro di una festa della birra sbarazzina con rulli ricchi di simboli pronti per offrire vincite mentre ti godi questo simil Oktoberfest. La grafica è interessante, in stile cartoon e ti permette di posizionare i rulli al centro di una campagna, tra una bancarella e una fiera tradizionale. La birra è il nostro Wild, pronto a sostituire tutti gli altri simboli.\nFunzioni speciali di Bjergarten Fest\nIl simbolo dei giri gratuiti è il primo vero e sorprendente regalo che questa slot vuole fare ai giocatori: con 3 simboli puoi ottenere 10 giri, con 4 ne ricevi 15 e se posizioni 5 icone potrai giocare per 20 giri gratuiti. Ma il pezzo forte arriva ora: con 3-5 simboli bonus in qualsiasi punto dei rulli potrai accedere al mini-game che viene associato a questa slot. Si tratta di un’idea molto carina che ti permetterà di abbinare gli ordini legati a cibo e bevande per i clienti che hai di fronte. Potrai vincere premi interessanti utili per aumentare il tuo bottino finale.\nConsiderazioni finali\nIl divertimento non manca quando provi Bjergarten Fest, una slot davvero irriverente che mette assolutamente di buon umore grazie alla sua atmosfera. La colonna sonora è la sola nota dolente della slot, insieme al suo RTP un po’ troppo contenuto. Per il resto tutto è stato ben progettato, a partire da un gameplay che può offrire giocate piacevoli e fluide.

The theme of the game takes inspiration from the lively beer festivals in Germany. The game features a slightly lower than average RTP of 95%, but it offers plenty of surprises and exciting power-ups through Wild and Scatter symbols. Additionally, there is a bonus round waiting to be discovered.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nThe gameplay of Biergarten Fest is intuitive and simplistic. Players can easily spin the reels effortlessly, and win payouts for a variety of winning combinations. The Wild symbol (Beer) substitutes all other symbols on the reels, while the symbol of free spins grants players as much as 20 extra spins. Moreover, the game's highlight is the bonus round, triggered by three to five bonus symbols anywhere on the reels. In the bonus round, players can match food and drink orders for customers to win attractive prizes.\n\nGraphics and Design Inspired by Oktoberfest\n\nThe graphics of Biergarten Fest are cartoonish and lively, capturing the essence of the Oktoberfest event. The reels are placed in the middle of a countryside fair, between market stalls and traditional fairs. The game's symbols are well-designed and contribute to the theme of beer festivals, accompanied by a fitting soundtrack that immerses players into the game's atmosphere.\n\nPotential Prizes and Payouts\n\nPlayers can win payouts through different combinations of symbols on the reels. The Wild symbol can substitute all other symbols to create the highest paying combination. Landing three, four, or five symbols of free spins can grant as much as 10, 15, or 20 extra spins. Moreover, the bonus round offers players the chance to win attractive prizes to increase their final payout.\n\nOverall Player Experience and RTP\n\nBiergarten Fest offers an enjoyable slot experience, thanks to its immersive graphics and well-designed symbols. The gameplay is smooth, and the game's features and bonus rounds add to its overall appeal. However, experienced players might find a 95% RTP slightly lower than their expectations. Nonetheless, the game offers plenty of surprises and entertainment to compensate for this downside.\n\n        \n            ",

With plenty of surprises, free spins, and power-ups provided by the Wild and Scatter symbols, there's even a bonus round waiting to be discovered.\n\nGraphics and Features\n\nDance, let loose with a beer in your hand, and celebrate the wins associated with Biergarten Fest. The game pays homage to another classic with this theme, Heidi and Hanna's Bier Hause, and puts you at the center of a lively beer festival with reels full of symbols ready to offer wins as you enjoy this Oktoberfest-inspired game. The graphics are interesting, in cartoon style, and allow you to position the reels in the middle of a countryside fair, between market stalls and traditional fairs. Beer is our Wild, ready to substitute all other symbols.\n\nSpecial features of Biergarten Fest\n\nThe symbol of free spins is the first real and surprising gift that this slot wants to offer to players: with 3 symbols, you can get 10 spins, with 4 you can receive 15, and if you land 5 icons, you can play for 20 free spins. But the real highlight is now coming: with 3-5 bonus symbols anywhere on the reels, you can access the mini-game associated with this slot. It's a very cute idea that allows you to match food and drink orders for the customers in front of you. You can win interesting prizes useful to increase your final payout.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThere's no shortage of fun when you try out Biergarten Fest, a truly irreverent slot that will definitely put you in a good mood thanks to its atmosphere. The soundtrack is the only downside of the slot, along with its slightly low RTP. However, everything has been well designed, starting from gameplay that can offer enjoyable and smooth spins. Furthermore, the graphics are fantastic, and the symbols are well-studied for all types of combinations. Experienced gamblers are sure to love this game.\n        ",
