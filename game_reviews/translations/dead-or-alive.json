Questa funzione prevede che dopo aver ottenuto un allineamento vincente si possano bloccare i simboli che l’hanno determinato e far girare solo i rulli corrispondenti ai restanti simboli. In questo modo le possibilità di vincita risultano aumentate e il giocatore ci guadagna anche in termini di divertimento!\nDue pistole incrociate sono invece lo Scatter, che regala dei giri gratis se compare sui rulli, in qualsiasi posizione, per almeno tre volte. Si possono ottenere fino a 12 free spins!\nLa vincita massima a cui si può ambire su Dead or Alive, sfruttando anche la funzione Sticky Win, è di 54.000 €, un jackpot di tutto rispetto!\n\nCome giocare a Dead or Alive\nPer prima cosa, sottolineiamo il fatto che si può giocare a questa slot anche in modalità Play for Fun, cioè totalmente gratis. Questa opzione è l’ideale per chi ama solo l’aspetto ludico delle slot machine, ma anche per coloro che vogliono imparare tutti i trucchi e prendere confidenza con il gioco prima di puntare soldi veri.\nSulla schermata di Dead or Alive, di fianco al tasto che permette di dare il via ai giri troviamo quello di impostazione della puntata massima e, sotto, quelli che ci permettono di scegliere il valore in euro da attribuire al singolo gettone e il livello (ce ne sono nove!).\nLa funzione Autoplay può essere avviata con il tasto apposito dopo aver settato il gioco: i rulli gireranno in maniera automatica ma si potrà tornare alla modalità manuale in ogni momento semplicemente cliccando sul tasto “stop”.\n",

Starting with the graphics, Dead or Alive is certainly fascinating: although the background is simply a landscape of the Wild West, there are also some cute animations that animate the game even before the reels start spinning. The gray and cloudy sky is illuminated by unsettling flashes of lightning, and an old oil lamp sways in the wind.\nThe sound effects are equally immersive: you can hear the wind blowing on dusty roads, the hinges of a saloon door creaking eerily, and a distant dog barking. Overall, it is a really well-crafted slot machine that can give enthusiasts an engaging and realistic gaming experience.\n\nSymbols, Wild and Scatter\nThe symbols of Dead or Alive are all coherent with the theme of the Wild West: we find the pointed cowboy boots, the sheriff's star-shaped badge, and the inevitable smoking guns, as in the tradition of the best Western films.\nThe Wild symbol is represented by the \"Wanted\" sign and has a dual function: it can act as a wild card, substituting for all other symbols in completing a paying combination, and can activate the Sticky Win feature. This feature provides that after obtaining a winning alignment, the symbols that determined it can be blocked and only the reels corresponding to the remaining symbols can be spun. In this way, the chances of winning increase and the player also gains in terms of fun! Two crossed guns are instead the Scatter, which gives free spins if it appears on the reels, in any position, at least three times. Up to 12 free spins can be obtained! The maximum win that can be aspired to on Dead or Alive, also using the Sticky Win feature, is €54,000, a respectable jackpot!\n\nHow to play Dead or Alive\nFirst of all, we emphasize the fact that this slot can also be played in Play for Fun mode, completely for free. This option is ideal for those who only love the playful aspect of slot machines, but also for those who want to learn all the tricks and become familiar with the game before betting real money. On the Dead or Alive screen, next to the button that allows you to start the spins, we find the one for setting the maximum bet and, below, those that allow us to choose the euro value to be attributed to each token and the level (there are nine!).

Starting with the graphics, Dead or Alive is decidedly fascinating: even though the background is just a landscape of the Wild West, there are also cute animations that liven up the game even before the reels start spinning: the gray and cloudy sky is illuminated by lightning that is not reassuring and an old oil lamp sways in the wind. The sound effects are equally engaging: you can hear the wind blowing on the dusty roads, the hinges of the door of a saloon creaking eerily, and a dog barking in the distance. Overall, it is a slot machine that is truly well-curated and capable of giving fans an immersive and realistic gaming experience.\n\nSymbols, Wild, and Scatter\nThe symbols of Dead or Alive are all consistent with the theme of the Wild West: in fact, we find cowboy pointed boots, the sheriff's star-shaped badge, and the inevitable smoking guns, as in the tradition of the best Western movies. The Wild symbol is represented by the \"Wanted\" sign and has a dual function: it can act as a Jolly, replacing all the other symbols in completing a winning combination, and it can activate the Sticky Win feature. This feature provides that after getting a winning alignment, you can hold the symbols that determined it and spin only the reels corresponding to the remaining symbols. In this way, the chances of winning increase, and the player gains in terms of fun! Two crossed guns are instead the Scatter, which awards free spins if it appears on the reels, in any position, at least three times. You can get up to 12 free spins! The maximum win that can be achieved on Dead or Alive, also by using the Sticky Win feature, is €54,000, a respectable jackpot!\n\nHow to play Dead or Alive\nFirst of all, we emphasize the fact that you can play this slot in Play for Fun mode, i.e. completely for free. This option is ideal for those who love only the playful aspect of slot machines, but also for those who want to learn all the tricks and become familiar with the game before betting real money. On the screen of Dead or Alive, next to the button that allows you to start the spins, we find the one for setting the maximum bet, and below it the ones that allow us to choose the euro value to be assigned to each individual token and the level (there are nine of them!). The Autoplay function can be started with the appropriate button after setting the game: the reels will spin automatically, but you can return to manual mode at any time by simply clicking on the \"stop\" button.\n            ",

The game's graphics, animations, and sound effects all contribute to creating a realistic gaming experience. The Sticky Win feature adds an extra layer of excitement to the game by allowing players to hold onto the symbols that determine winning combinations and spin only the wheels corresponding to remaining symbols. With up to 12 free spins available as well, Dead or Alive offers a thrilling gaming experience.\n\nGraphics and Audio\n\nThe graphics and sound effects of Dead or Alive are top-notch, evoking a sense of the Wild West perfectly. The background is well-designed, featuring a landscape of the vast, open plains typical of the American West. The animations are smooth and engaging, breathing life into the game before the reels even start spinning. The sound effects, such as the wind blowing on the dusty roads and the creaking of the door of a saloon, add an extra layer of immersion to the game.\n\nTheme and Symbols\n\nDead or Alive is a slot machine that immerses players into the exciting and dangerous world of the Wild West. The symbols, including cowboy boots, sheriff's badges, and smoking guns, all contribute to creating a Western-inspired atmosphere. The Wanted sign serves as the Wild symbol, replacing all other symbols to complete winning combinations and activate the Sticky Win feature. Meanwhile, two crossed guns represent the Scatter symbol, awarding free spins and increasing players' winning potential.\n\nBetting Options\n\nDead or Alive offers a range of betting options to suit every player's budget. The minimum coin value is €0.01, while the maximum coin value is €0.50. The game also features a maximum bet button, which sets the highest bet possible. Additionally, there are nine levels available that players can choose from. The Autoplay function makes it possible to have the reels spin automatically, but players can switch back to manual mode at any time.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nDead or Alive offers players the opportunity to win big with a maximum jackpot of €54,000 achievable by using the Sticky Win feature. Additionally, players can win up to 12 free spins if they land at least three Scatter symbols on the reels. With the possibility of holding on to the symbols that determine winning combinations, the Sticky Win feature provides an exciting gameplay experience that can lead to even bigger wins.\n\n        \n            ",

Starting with the graphics, Dead or Alive is decidedly fascinating: even though the background is just a landscape of the Wild West, there are also cute animations that liven up the game even before the reels start spinning: the gray and cloudy sky is illuminated by lightning that is not reassuring and an old oil lamp sways in the wind. The sound effects are equally engaging: you can hear the wind blowing on the dusty roads, the hinges of the door of a saloon creaking eerily, and a dog barking in the distance. Overall, it is a slot machine that is truly well-curated and capable of giving fans an immersive and realistic gaming experience.\n\nSymbols, Wild, and Scatter\nThe symbols of Dead or Alive are all consistent with the theme of the Wild West: in fact, we find cowboy pointed boots, the sheriff's star-shaped badge, and the inevitable smoking guns, as in the tradition of the best Western movies. The Wild symbol is represented by the \"Wanted\" sign and has a dual function: it can act as a Jolly, replacing all the other symbols in completing a winning combination, and it can activate the Sticky Win feature. This feature provides that after getting a winning alignment, you can hold the symbols that determined it and spin only the reels corresponding to the remaining symbols. In this way, the chances of winning increase, and the player gains in terms of fun! Two crossed guns are instead the Scatter, which awards free spins if it appears on the reels, in any position, at least three times. You can get up to 12 free spins! The maximum win that can be achieved on Dead or Alive, also by using the Sticky Win feature, is €54,000, a respectable jackpot!\n\nHow to play Dead or Alive\nFirst of all, we emphasize the fact that you can play this slot in Play for Fun mode, i.e. completely for free. This option is ideal for those who love only the playful aspect of slot machines, but also for those who want to learn all the tricks and become familiar with the game before betting real money. On the screen of Dead or Alive, next to the button that allows you to start the spins, we find the one for setting the maximum bet, and below it the ones that allow us to choose the euro value to be assigned to each individual token and the level (there are nine of them!). The Autoplay function can be started with the appropriate button after setting the game: the reels will spin automatically, but you can return to manual mode at any time by simply clicking on the \"stop\" button.\n            ",

Starting with the graphics, Dead or Alive is decidedly fascinating: even though the background is just a landscape of the Wild West, there are also cute animations that liven up the game even before the reels start spinning: the gray and cloudy sky is illuminated by lightning that is not reassuring and an old oil lamp sways in the wind. The sound effects are equally engaging: you can hear the wind blowing on the dusty roads, the hinges of the door of a saloon creaking eerily, and a dog barking in the distance. Overall, it is a slot machine that is truly well-curated and capable of giving fans an immersive and realistic gaming experience.\n\nSymbols, Wild, and Scatter\nThe symbols of Dead or Alive are all consistent with the theme of the Wild West: in fact, we find cowboy pointed boots, the sheriff's star-shaped badge, and the inevitable smoking guns, as in the tradition of the best Western movies. The Wild symbol is represented by the \"Wanted\" sign and has a dual function: it can act as a Jolly, replacing all the other symbols in completing a winning combination, and it can activate the Sticky Win feature. This feature provides that after getting a winning alignment, you can hold the symbols that determined it and spin only the reels corresponding to the remaining symbols. In this way, the chances of winning increase, and the player gains in terms of fun! Two crossed guns are instead the Scatter, which awards free spins if it appears on the reels, in any position, at least three times. You can get up to 12 free spins! The maximum win that can be achieved on Dead or Alive, also by using the Sticky Win feature, is €54,000, a respectable jackpot!\n\nHow to play Dead or Alive\nFirst of all, we emphasize the fact that you can play this slot in Play for Fun mode, i.e. completely for free. This option is ideal for those who love only the playful aspect of slot machines, but also for those who want to learn all the tricks and become familiar with the game before betting real money. On the screen of Dead or Alive, next to the button that allows you to start the spins, we find the one for setting the maximum bet, and below it the ones that allow us to choose the euro value to be assigned to each individual token and the level (there are nine of them!). The Autoplay function can be started with the appropriate button after setting the game: the reels will spin automatically, but you can return to manual mode at any time by simply clicking on the \"stop\" button.\n        ",
