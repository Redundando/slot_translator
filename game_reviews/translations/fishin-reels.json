And also for a good catch, especially if waiting for us are succulent fish and lobsters like those of Fishin' Reels.\n\nThis Pragmatic Play slot has excellent graphics, with super-detailed designs and bright colors. We challenge anyone to play Fishin' Reels without feeling the irresistible urge to run to the nearest beach for a refreshing swim.\n\nThe setting is the underwater world teeming with life, with many bubbles rising towards the surface and the reflections of the sun creating abstract shapes on the sand. Some cute animations make the game more dynamic, the cheerful music is pleasant to listen to but can be turned off at any time. At the bottom, we find the buttons and the statistics of the bet.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFor Fishin' Reels we have a 5 reels and 3 rows grid on which 10 fixed paylines are played. The betting range is suitable for every type of player: the less experienced who doesn't want to invest much money can go for a bet from 0.10 € per spin, while the most seasoned player can bet up to 100 €.\n\nWinning combinations are made by matching 3 to 5 adjacent symbols from left to right on an active payline.\n\nThe autoplay option allows us to select a number of Autospins ranging from 10 to 100, and we can also set win and loss limits.\n\nThe RTP value is very good, at 96.5%, while the volatility is high, meaning you win less often but have a higher chance of winning big sums in a short amount of time.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nThere are 10 regular symbols, some low-paying, others that pay very well even with the minimum bet. Let's start with the least lucrative ones, which are represented by the playing card suits: diamonds and clubs, with a bet of 0.01 € per line, pay a maximum of 1 €; hearts and spades pay 1.50 €.\n\nWith the sea-themed symbols, the levels go up: fins and masks pay up to 2 €, the starfish 3 €, the lobster 4 €, the frog 5 € and the fish 10 €.\n\nLet's now move on to the special symbols. The Wild symbol, surrounded by seaweed, is our Joker and replaces all symbols except the bonus ones. The golden swordfish is the Scatter symbol. It can appear on all reels and at least 3 are needed to activate 10 Free Spins. With 4 symbols, we will have 12 Free Spins and with 15 we will be offered 15. Before starting, we will be asked to choose one of two functions. Let's see them in detail:\n\nReel it in: on the screen, 9 fish, a bait basket, a boot and a can with a worm coming out are displayed. On each spin, symbols are associated with a multiplier ranging from 0.5x to 250x or other extra spins. On the fifth reel, each time the fisherman appears, the winnings of the Money Fish or extra spins are added up. In addition, 2 more free spins are added.\n\nThe Big Catch: here there is a golden fish, called the Big Fish symbol, which randomly overlaps with other symbols. If three appear, an additional mini-game with 8 fish is triggered, each one associated with multipliers ranging from 0.2x to 250x. Each spin selects a fish and multiplies its value by the total bet.\n        ",

And also for a good catch, especially if waiting for us are succulent fish and lobsters like those of Fishin' Reels.\n\nThis Pragmatic Play slot has excellent graphics, with super-detailed designs and bright colors. We challenge anyone to play Fishin' Reels without feeling the irresistible urge to run to the nearest beach for a refreshing swim.\n\nThe setting is the underwater world teeming with life, with many bubbles rising towards the surface and the reflections of the sun creating abstract shapes on the sand. Some cute animations make the game more dynamic, the cheerful music is pleasant to listen to but can be turned off at any time. At the bottom, we find the buttons and the statistics of the bet.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFor Fishin' Reels we have a 5 reels and 3 rows grid on which 10 fixed paylines are played. The betting range is suitable for every type of player: the less experienced who doesn't want to invest much money can go for a bet from 0.10 € per spin, while the most seasoned player can bet up to 100 €.\n\nWinning combinations are made by matching 3 to 5 adjacent symbols from left to right on an active payline.\n\nThe autoplay option allows us to select a number of Autospins ranging from 10 to 100, and we can also set win and loss limits.\n\nThe RTP value is very good, at 96.5%, while the volatility is high, meaning you win less often but have a higher chance of winning big sums in a short amount of time.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nThere are 10 regular symbols, some low-paying, others that pay very well even with the minimum bet. Let's start with the least lucrative ones, which are represented by the playing card suits: diamonds and clubs, with a bet of 0.01 € per line, pay a maximum of 1 €; hearts and spades pay 1.50 €.\n\nWith the sea-themed symbols, the levels go up: fins and masks pay up to 2 €, the starfish 3 €, the lobster 4 €, the frog 5 € and the fish 10 €.\n\nLet's now move on to the special symbols. The Wild symbol, surrounded by seaweed, is our Joker and replaces all symbols except the bonus ones. The golden swordfish is the Scatter symbol. It can appear on all reels and at least 3 are needed to activate 10 Free Spins. With 4 symbols, we will have 12 Free Spins and with 15 we will be offered 15. Before starting, we will be asked to choose one of two functions. Let's see them in detail:\n\nReel it in: on the screen, 9 fish, a bait basket, a boot and a can with a worm coming out are displayed. On each spin, symbols are associated with a multiplier ranging from 0.5x to 250x or other extra spins. On the fifth reel, each time the fisherman appears, the winnings of the Money Fish or extra spins are added up. In addition, 2 more free spins are added.\n\nThe Big Catch: here there is a golden fish, called the Big Fish symbol, which randomly overlaps with other symbols. If three appear, an additional mini-game with 8 fish is triggered, each one associated with multipliers ranging from 0.2x to 250x. Each spin selects a fish and multiplies its value by the total bet.\n            ",

The game has autoplay functionality, allowing players to set a number of Autospins between 10 and 100, and also win and loss limits. Winning combinations are made by matching 3 to 5 adjacent symbols from left to right on an active payline. The game is set in an underwater world teeming with life with many bubbles rising towards the surface and the reflections of the sun creating abstract shapes on the sand. Some cute animations make the game more dynamic, and the cheerful music is pleasant to listen to but can be turned off at any time.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nFishin' Reels has 10 regular symbols, with low-paying symbols represented by playing card suits: diamonds and clubs, with a bet of 0.01 € per line, pay a maximum of 1 €; hearts and spades pay 1.50 €. The other symbols are sea-themed symbols, which pay better than the low-paying symbols: fins and masks pay up to 2 €, the starfish 3 €, the lobster 4 €, the frog 5 € and the fish 10 €. There are two special symbols in Fishin' Reels: Wild and Scatter. The Wild symbol, surrounded by seaweed, replaces all other symbols except the Scatter. The golden swordfish is the Scatter symbol, and if at least three symbols land, it will activate a round of Free Spins.\n\nBetting Range\n\nFishin' Reels is suitable for all levels of players, with a betting range that can cater for the less experienced players who don't want to invest much money, starting at a minimum bet of 0.10 € per spin. The seasoned players can bet up to 100 € per spin.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nThe return-to-player rate for Fishin' Reels is very good, at 96.5%. The game has a high volatility rate, which means that winning combinations will happen less often, but players have a higher chance of winning big sums in a short amount of time.\n\nFree Spins\n\nTo activate the Free Spins round in Fishin' Reels, players need to land at least three Scatter symbols. When triggered, players can select one of two potential game functions, Reel it in and the Big Catch. Reel it in displays nine fish, a bait basket, a boot, and a can with a worm, all associated with multipliers ranging from 0.5x to 250x, and also additional extra spins. Each time the fisherman appears, the winnings of the Money Fish or extra spins are added up, and two more free spins are added. The Big Catch includes a golden fish, called the Big Fish symbol, which randomly overlaps with other game symbols. If three appear, an additional mini-game with eight fish is triggered, each associated with multipliers ranging from 0.2x to 250x. Each spin selects a fish and multiplies its value by the total bet.\n\n        \n            ",

The game's setting is the underwater world, with some cute animations and cheerful music to complement the graphics. The game's betting range is suitable for both novice and seasoned players, with a minimum bet of €0.10 and a maximum bet of €100. Winning combinations are made by matching 3 to 5 adjacent symbols from left to right on an active payline. The game has an autoplay option that lets players choose a number of Autospins ranging from 10 to 100 and set win and loss limits. The RTP value is very good at 96.5%, while the volatility is high.\n\nSymbols and Special Features\n\nFishin' Reels has 10 regular symbols and 2 special symbols. The regular symbols are divided into two categories: the low-paying playing card suits and the high-paying sea-themed symbols. The Wild symbol is the Joker and replaces all symbols except the bonus ones. The Scatter symbol is the golden swordfish, which can appear on all reels and activates Free Spins. The game offers two Free Spins functions: Reel it in and The Big Catch. In Reel it in, players can receive multipliers ranging from 0.5x to 250x and extra spins on each spin. On the fifth reel, the fisherman appears to add up the winnings of the Money Fish or extra spins and add two more free spins. In The Big Catch, a golden fish called the Big Fish symbol randomly overlaps with other symbols. If three appear, an additional mini-game with 8 fish is triggered, each with multipliers ranging from 0.2x to 250x. Each spin selects a fish and multiplies its value by the total bet.\n\nBetting Range and RTP\n\nFishin' Reels has a betting range suitable for every type of player. The minimum bet is €0.10, while the maximum bet is €100. The RTP value is very good at 96.5%, indicating that for every €100 wagered, the game pays out an average of €96.50 over time. The game's volatility is high, meaning that wins are less frequent, but players can win big sums in a short amount of time.\n\nAutoplay Feature\n\nFishin' Reels offers an autoplay option, allowing players to select a number of Autospins ranging from 10 to 100. Players can also set win and loss limits.\n\nFree Spins Round\n\nFishin' Reels offers a Free Spins feature that is activated by the golden swordfish Scatter symbol, which can appear on all reels. Landing at least 3 Scatters will activate 10 Free Spins. 4 Scatters will activate 12 Free Spins, while 5 Scatters will activate 15 Free Spins. Before starting, players will be asked to choose one of two functions: Reel it in or The Big Catch. In Reel it in, players can receive multipliers ranging from 0.5x to 250x and extra spins on each spin. On the fifth reel, the fisherman appears to add up the winnings of the Money Fish or extra spins and add two more free spins. In The Big Catch, a golden fish called the Big Fish symbol randomly overlaps with other symbols. If three appear, an additional mini-game with 8 fish is triggered, each with multipliers ranging from 0.2x to 250x. Each spin selects a fish and multiplies its value by the total bet.\n\n        \n            ",

And also for a good catch, especially if waiting for us are succulent fish and lobsters like those of Fishin' Reels.\n\nThis Pragmatic Play slot has excellent graphics, with super-detailed designs and bright colors. We challenge anyone to play Fishin' Reels without feeling the irresistible urge to run to the nearest beach for a refreshing swim.\n\nThe setting is the underwater world teeming with life, with many bubbles rising towards the surface and the reflections of the sun creating abstract shapes on the sand. Some cute animations make the game more dynamic, the cheerful music is pleasant to listen to but can be turned off at any time. At the bottom, we find the buttons and the statistics of the bet.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFor Fishin' Reels we have a 5 reels and 3 rows grid on which 10 fixed paylines are played. The betting range is suitable for every type of player: the less experienced who doesn't want to invest much money can go for a bet from 0.10 € per spin, while the most seasoned player can bet up to 100 €.\n\nWinning combinations are made by matching 3 to 5 adjacent symbols from left to right on an active payline.\n\nThe autoplay option allows us to select a number of Autospins ranging from 10 to 100, and we can also set win and loss limits.\n\nThe RTP value is very good, at 96.5%, while the volatility is high, meaning you win less often but have a higher chance of winning big sums in a short amount of time.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nThere are 10 regular symbols, some low-paying, others that pay very well even with the minimum bet. Let's start with the least lucrative ones, which are represented by the playing card suits: diamonds and clubs, with a bet of 0.01 € per line, pay a maximum of 1 €; hearts and spades pay 1.50 €.\n\nWith the sea-themed symbols, the levels go up: fins and masks pay up to 2 €, the starfish 3 €, the lobster 4 €, the frog 5 € and the fish 10 €.\n\nLet's now move on to the special symbols. The Wild symbol, surrounded by seaweed, is our Joker and replaces all symbols except the bonus ones. The golden swordfish is the Scatter symbol. It can appear on all reels and at least 3 are needed to activate 10 Free Spins. With 4 symbols, we will have 12 Free Spins and with 15 we will be offered 15. Before starting, we will be asked to choose one of two functions. Let's see them in detail:\n\nReel it in: on the screen, 9 fish, a bait basket, a boot and a can with a worm coming out are displayed. On each spin, symbols are associated with a multiplier ranging from 0.5x to 250x or other extra spins. On the fifth reel, each time the fisherman appears, the winnings of the Money Fish or extra spins are added up. In addition, 2 more free spins are added.\n\nThe Big Catch: here there is a golden fish, called the Big Fish symbol, which randomly overlaps with other symbols. If three appear, an additional mini-game with 8 fish is triggered, each one associated with multipliers ranging from 0.2x to 250x. Each spin selects a fish and multiplies its value by the total bet.\n            ",

And also for a good catch, especially if waiting for us are succulent fish and lobsters like those of Fishin' Reels.\n\nThis Pragmatic Play slot has excellent graphics, with super-detailed designs and bright colors. We challenge anyone to play Fishin' Reels without feeling the irresistible urge to run to the nearest beach for a refreshing swim.\n\nThe setting is the underwater world teeming with life, with many bubbles rising towards the surface and the reflections of the sun creating abstract shapes on the sand. Some cute animations make the game more dynamic, the cheerful music is pleasant to listen to but can be turned off at any time. At the bottom, we find the buttons and the statistics of the bet.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFor Fishin' Reels we have a 5 reels and 3 rows grid on which 10 fixed paylines are played. The betting range is suitable for every type of player: the less experienced who doesn't want to invest much money can go for a bet from 0.10 € per spin, while the most seasoned player can bet up to 100 €.\n\nWinning combinations are made by matching 3 to 5 adjacent symbols from left to right on an active payline.\n\nThe autoplay option allows us to select a number of Autospins ranging from 10 to 100, and we can also set win and loss limits.\n\nThe RTP value is very good, at 96.5%, while the volatility is high, meaning you win less often but have a higher chance of winning big sums in a short amount of time.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nThere are 10 regular symbols, some low-paying, others that pay very well even with the minimum bet. Let's start with the least lucrative ones, which are represented by the playing card suits: diamonds and clubs, with a bet of 0.01 € per line, pay a maximum of 1 €; hearts and spades pay 1.50 €.\n\nWith the sea-themed symbols, the levels go up: fins and masks pay up to 2 €, the starfish 3 €, the lobster 4 €, the frog 5 € and the fish 10 €.\n\nLet's now move on to the special symbols. The Wild symbol, surrounded by seaweed, is our Joker and replaces all symbols except the bonus ones. The golden swordfish is the Scatter symbol. It can appear on all reels and at least 3 are needed to activate 10 Free Spins. With 4 symbols, we will have 12 Free Spins and with 15 we will be offered 15. Before starting, we will be asked to choose one of two functions. Let's see them in detail:\n\nReel it in: on the screen, 9 fish, a bait basket, a boot and a can with a worm coming out are displayed. On each spin, symbols are associated with a multiplier ranging from 0.5x to 250x or other extra spins. On the fifth reel, each time the fisherman appears, the winnings of the Money Fish or extra spins are added up. In addition, 2 more free spins are added.\n\nThe Big Catch: here there is a golden fish, called the Big Fish symbol, which randomly overlaps with other symbols. If three appear, an additional mini-game with 8 fish is triggered, each one associated with multipliers ranging from 0.2x to 250x. Each spin selects a fish and multiplies its value by the total bet.\n        ",
