The mysterious symbols and music playing while the reels are in motion make for enjoyable games with good chances of winning.

With 5 reels, 4 rows, and 30 paylines, you can start winning! You can bet in this game from 1 cent up to 1 Euro. Press the SPIN button and see what fate has in store for you. As for the RTP, the game pays out 95.87%, which is acceptable, but remember that 2% will come from the Progressive Jackpots, so China River doesn't do it all by itself!\n\nSymbols to discover...\n\nThe lowest symbols are the six Royals.\nThe highest paying symbols are: a Frog, a Gold Bowl, a Lotus Flower, and a ridiculous Chinese Character all dressed in gold. If you get 5, the game will reward you with 33.33 times your bet.\nThe symbol of the Yellow Bird is the Wild. It can land on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and replace any paying symbol.

If 3 to 5 land on the reels, they will give you from 8 to 15 free spins, plus a prize of up to 100 times your bet.\n\nWhat are China River's 3 Jackpots?\n\nThis no-download slot has 3 progressive jackpots that must be won before they reach preset levels of 1,500, 20,000, or 200,000 credits. They are:\n\nMinor,\nMajor\nEpic.\n\nIt cannot be said for certain when they will be won, the process happens randomly and at any time.

All mystery symbol positions on each individual reel are replaced by the same icon per spin except for the Wild.\n\nMy final conclusions\n\nLike all the best Bally slots, China River is available to play for real money or in demo mode without any deposit.

Well, buckle up and get ready to experience the thrill of the three progressive jackpots that must be won before they reach preset levels of 1,500, 20,000, or a whopping 200,000 credits. It's like chasing a dragon, but way more profitable!</p>\n                <p>The jackpots are called Minor, Major, and Epic, and boy oh boy, could they make your day if you hit them right. The game's current amount for each jackpot is displayed right above the reels. Just imagine raking in all that sweet, sweet moolah! But if you don't hit the jackpot, no need to cry yourself to sleep, as you can still enjoy plenty of other cash prizes. No one leaves China River empty-handed.</p>\n                <p>As with all great things in life, there's a catch. When a Jackpot is won, it is reset to an initial amount of about 25% of the amount paid. But don't be discouraged. This is just enough time for you to win it again and again.</p>\n                <p>Oh, and did we mention that 2% of each bet is used to feed the three jackpots? This not only makes the jackpots grow faster but also contributes to the game's RTP of 95.87%. So, not only do you have a chance of winning that sweet, sweet jackpot, but you also get a solid return on your investment. Talk about a win-win situation!</p>\"\n}"

Don't miss the precious symbol of the Blue Bird of Happiness and try to catch it! The mysterious symbols and music playing while the reels are in motion make for enjoyable games with good chances of winning. Read my review and try the free version at our online casinos.\n\nWhat are the distinctive elements of this gameplay?\n\nBally's China River no-download slot features minimal gameplay with a background that shows leaves and flowers. With 5 reels, 4 rows, and 30 paylines, you can start winning! You can bet in this game from 1 cent up to 1 Euro. Press the SPIN button and see what fate has in store for you. As for the RTP, the game pays out 95.87%, which is acceptable, but remember that 2% will come from the Progressive Jackpots, so China River doesn't do it all by itself!\n\nSymbols to discover...\n\nThe lowest symbols are the six Royals.\nThe highest paying symbols are: a Frog, a Gold Bowl, a Lotus Flower, and a ridiculous Chinese Character all dressed in gold. If you get 5, the game will reward you with 33.33 times your bet.\nThe symbol of the Yellow Bird is the Wild. It can land on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and replace any paying symbol. When it does, a beautiful animation depicting a boat on a river covered with a rain of flowers will start.\nThe symbols of the colored Coins in gold and red are the Scatters. If 3 to 5 land on the reels, they will give you from 8 to 15 free spins, plus a prize of up to 100 times your bet.\n\nWhat are China River's 3 Jackpots?\n\nThis no-download slot has 3 progressive jackpots that must be won before they reach preset levels of 1,500, 20,000, or 200,000 credits. They are:\n\nMinor,\nMajor\nEpic.\n\nIt cannot be said for certain when they will be won, the process happens randomly and at any time. When a Jackpot is won, it is reset to an initial amount of about 25% of the amount paid. 2% of each bet is used to feed the three Jackpots and the process starts over.\n\nWhat is the Mystery Stacked Reels feature?\n\nEach reel contains positions of mystery symbols stacked that are replaced with one of two or three randomly chosen symbols when the spin is initiated. All mystery symbol positions on each individual reel are replaced by the same icon per spin except for the Wild.\n\nMy final conclusions\n\nLike all the best Bally slots, China River is available to play for real money or in demo mode without any deposit. You will find the title in our casinos and on the occasion, you can take a look at other Asian-themed games or opt for the fascinating world of Ancient Egypt!\n            ",

Don't miss the precious symbol of the Blue Bird of Happiness and try to catch it! The mysterious symbols and music playing while the reels are in motion make for enjoyable games with good chances of winning. Read my review and try the free version at our online casinos.\n\nWhat are the distinctive elements of this gameplay?\n\nBally's China River no-download slot features minimal gameplay with a background that shows leaves and flowers. With 5 reels, 4 rows, and 30 paylines, you can start winning! You can bet in this game from 1 cent up to 1 Euro. Press the SPIN button and see what fate has in store for you. As for the RTP, the game pays out 95.87%, which is acceptable, but remember that 2% will come from the Progressive Jackpots, so China River doesn't do it all by itself!\n\nSymbols to discover...\n\nThe lowest symbols are the six Royals.\nThe highest paying symbols are: a Frog, a Gold Bowl, a Lotus Flower, and a ridiculous Chinese Character all dressed in gold. If you get 5, the game will reward you with 33.33 times your bet.\nThe symbol of the Yellow Bird is the Wild. It can land on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and replace any paying symbol. When it does, a beautiful animation depicting a boat on a river covered with a rain of flowers will start.\nThe symbols of the colored Coins in gold and red are the Scatters. If 3 to 5 land on the reels, they will give you from 8 to 15 free spins, plus a prize of up to 100 times your bet.\n\nWhat are China River's 3 Jackpots?\n\nThis no-download slot has 3 progressive jackpots that must be won before they reach preset levels of 1,500, 20,000, or 200,000 credits. They are:\n\nMinor,\nMajor\nEpic.\n\nIt cannot be said for certain when they will be won, the process happens randomly and at any time. When a Jackpot is won, it is reset to an initial amount of about 25% of the amount paid. 2% of each bet is used to feed the three Jackpots and the process starts over.\n\nWhat is the Mystery Stacked Reels feature?\n\nEach reel contains positions of mystery symbols stacked that are replaced with one of two or three randomly chosen symbols when the spin is initiated. All mystery symbol positions on each individual reel are replaced by the same icon per spin except for the Wild.\n\nMy final conclusions\n\nLike all the best Bally slots, China River is available to play for real money or in demo mode without any deposit. You will find the title in our casinos and on the occasion, you can take a look at other Asian-themed games or opt for the fascinating world of Ancient Egypt!\n            ",
