Only the Spanish conquistadors have brought to the Western world the rich history, fascinating traditions, and sometimes extreme practices of the Aztecs. Legends of cities like the famous Eldorado covered in gold have circled the globe, finding their way into films and literature. And now, they've found their way into online slot games, like Montezuma Megaways Buy Pass from WMS.\n\nMontezuma Megaways offers a different kind of slot experience, while still adhering to the classic conventions of online slots. This review will analyze not only its technical aspects, but also its aesthetic and sound design.\n\nIn the thick jungle where even light struggles to filter through the foliage, we see an intriguing game grid with a stone wheel above the reels. Of course, the symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q, J) scroll along the golden reels, adorned with jewels, crowns and crests, perhaps a nod to the Spanish conquistadors. The rest of the symbols are well-crafted illustrations of some of Emperor Montezuma's symbols, like the eagle, his flamboyant feather crown, and the two-headed serpent. We also see a depiction of a man and woman of the Aztec people as the face of a golden idol.\n\nDuring gameplay, we are accompanied by a slow, tribal and mysterious beat. Placing its emphasis on gameplay, Montezuma Megaways Buy Pass is a breath of fresh air from the usual historic-themed slots.\n\nAs for the technical aspect, this slot's game grid is one of a kind, with six reels and a varying number of horizontal lines that can change throughout the game. Above the game grid is a half-circle displaying additional symbols which can combine with the ones that appear on the lower screen.\n\nThe gameplay is intricate, and players need to practice with small bets before investing more time and money. The temple of Montezuma serves as the Wild symbol and is a popular sight to watch out for while playing.\n\nFor those who enjoy similar slots within the Aztec civilization theme, there are plenty of options like Aztec Warrior Princess, Aztec Temple, and Aztec Magic. Others may prefer games that follow the adventure theme, like Rich Wilde and the Aztec Idols or Relic Raiders.\n\nExperience the mystery and allure of the Aztec civilization with Montezuma Megaways Buy Pass.",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics\n\nMontezuma Megaways features a unique six-reel mechanism with a variable number of horizontal lines that can significantly change during play. Above the play grid, there is also a half-circle showing additional symbols that can combine with those that appear on the lower screen. The mechanism is very varied and requires the player to practice with low-value bets until they feel confident enough to invest more time and money in the game. Among the symbols that usually draw attention is the Montezuma temple, which serves as the Wild symbol.\n\nVisuals\n\nMontezuma Megaways offers a non-mainstream setting in the world of online slots that is vividly colored and well-cared for. The play grid is situated in the midst of a dense jungle where light struggles to filter through the foliage. The symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q, J) scroll along the golden reels with decorations of jewels, crowns, and coat-of-arms, perhaps a reference to the Spanish conquistadors. The rest of the symbols are decidedly well-drawn illustrations of some of Emperor Montezuma's symbols, such as the eagle, his flashy feather crown, and the two-headed snake. Alongside these, we find an Aztec man and woman in the form of a golden idol. The sound design is a slow, tribal, and mysterious rhythm that sets the mood for gameplay.\n\nTheme\n\nMontezuma Megaways is set in the world of the mysterious Aztecs, a rarely explored theme in the world of online slots. The game offers a fresh gaming experience while still staying within the classic standards of an online slot.\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe symbols in Montezuma Megaways are not only well-crafted illustrations but also reflect the Aztec theme of the game. Emperor Montezuma's symbols, such as the eagle, his flashy feather crown, and the two-headed snake, are particularly well-drawn. Alongside these, we find an Aztec man and woman in the form of a golden idol. The Montezuma temple serves as the Wild symbol in the game.\n\nSimilar slots\n\nThere are many slots that deal with Aztec civilizations, such as Aztec Warrior Princess, Aztec Temple, and Aztec Magic. Others, however, are all about adventure in ancient temples like Rich Wilde and the Aztec Idols or Relic Raiders.\n\n        \n            ",

Only the Spanish conquistadors brought the rich history and fascinating, sometimes extreme traditions of the Aztec civilization to the Western world. Legends of golden cities like the famous Eldorado have circled the globe, making their way into films and books, and even online slots.\n\nWMS's Montezuma Megaways offers a different gaming experience while staying within the classic standards of online slots. Our review will analyze not only its technical aspects but also the visuals and sound design. Let's start with the latter.\n\nMontezuma Megaways - Graphics\nIn a dense jungle where light struggles to filter through the foliage, we see a play grid made interesting by the stone wheel above the reels. The symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q, J) are inevitable and will scroll along the golden reels. These symbols are colored with decorations of jewels, crowns, and coat-of-arms, perhaps a reference to the Spanish conquistadors.\n\nThe rest of the symbols are decidedly well-drawn illustrations of some of Emperor Montezuma's symbols, such as the eagle, his flashy feather crown, and the two-headed snake. Alongside these, we find an Aztec man and woman in the form of a golden idol. As for the musical part, we will be accompanied during our plays by a slow, tribal, and mysterious rhythm.\n\nMontezuma Megaways has a non-mainstream setting in the world of online slots, is well-cared for and vividly colored. It's definitely a breath of fresh air among the usual historical settings of many slots. Let's move on to the technical aspects of this slot.\n\nMontezuma Megaways - Gameplay\nCertainly, discussing the technical aspect of this slot is one of the most challenging tasks because the play grid's mechanism is unique.\n\nFirst and foremost, we are faced with a gaming screen with six reels and a variable number of horizontal lines that can significantly change during play. Above the play grid, there is also a half-circle showing additional symbols that can combine with those that appear on the lower screen.\n\nThe mechanism is very varied, and it's up to the player to practice with low-value bets until they feel confident enough to invest more time and money in the game. Among the symbols that usually draw attention is the Montezuma temple, which serves as the Wild symbol.\n\nSimilar slots to Montezuma Megaways\nThere are many slots that deal with Aztec civilizations, but the most interesting slots on the theme are Aztec Warrior Princess, Aztec Temple, and Aztec Magic. Others, however, are all about adventure in ancient temples like Rich Wilde and the Aztec Idols or Relic Raiders.\n        ",
