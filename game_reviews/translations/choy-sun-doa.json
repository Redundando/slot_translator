Se volete provare a vincere tanti soldi infatti non dovete fare altro che giocare a questa slot, la quale offre ben 243 combinazioni vincenti e una vasta gamma di bonus e funzionalità utili per incrementare le vostre puntate. Aristocrat offre con la slot Choy Sun Doa un modo per guadagnare molti soldi, ma allo stesso tempo anche un piacevole passatempo ambientato nell’orientaleggiante Impero Cinese. Questa casa produttrice di giochi online è conosciuta proprio per l’alta probabilità di vincita alle slot, per il gameplay estremamente intuitivo e per la grafica accattivante.\nSe il divertimento e il guadagno sono di tuo interesse, continua a leggere per saperne sempre di più sulla slot Choy Sun Doa.\nGrafica\nCome dicevamo, Aristocrat ha un’abilità unica nello sviluppare giochi con un design unico e suggestivo, in grado di suscitare nel giocatore interesse e allo stesso tempo divertimento. Riesce a farlo attraverso la creazione di un tema avvincente e attraverso l’elaborazione di diversi dettagli che rendono l’ambiente molto più interattivo. In questa slot il tema principale è l’Impero Cinese e la sua cultura, e in particolare quello della “fortuna”, tematica molto importante in Oriente. I simboli all’interno della slot rispecchieranno quindi questa tematica della fortuna, infatti troveremo elementi come lingotti d’oro, monete e anelli di giada. L’intera grafica di gioco è molto luminosa, viva, positiva, che trasmette quindi divertimento e gioia nel giocatore che intraprende quest’avventura. Infine la capacità del gioco di far immergere completamente il giocatore in una cultura diversa da quella a cui è abituato, deriva anche dal fatto che lo stile con cui sono realizzate le grafiche è molto realistico e appagante, a dimostrazione della bravura di Aristocrat nello sviluppo dei giochi online.\nFunzioni e simboli\nAndiamo a vedere le funzioni e i simboli che contribuiscono a rendere questo gioco davvero eccitante.\nIl Dio della ricchezza rappresenta il simbolo “Wild”, perciò svolge una funzione di jolly nei rulli 2, 3 e 4.\nMentre il simbolo “Scatter” è rappresentato dal lingotto d’oro e deve comparire sui rulli 3, 4 o 5 per attivare la funzione Free Games. Una volta attivata questa funzione si potranno ricevere diversi bonus a seconda del simbolo che otteniamo: il pesce giallo ci permetterà di avere 20 free spins, il pesce rosso ce ne concederà 15, il pesce blu 10 , il pesce rosa 8 e infine il pesce verde ci farà ottenere 5 free spins. Se combinati anche con il simbolo Wild, avremo anche una moltiplicazione della nostra puntata fino a 30 volte.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nAnche la casa produttrice Pragmatic Play ha sviluppato una slot simile, Peking Luck, basata quindi sulla tradizione cinese e in particolare sulla fortuna e sul Capodanno cinese. Anche questa è molto semplice e intuitiva e sfrutta una griglia 5×3. Perciò, se cerchi un’altra slot simile a Choy Sun Doa, questa potrebbe essere la scelta giusta.\n",
