This game is designed to impress experienced gamblers instantly, with its cluster-based winning combinations, action-packed reels, and high-quality graphics. As usual, Betsoft has proven its ability to design a stunning cinematic-style slot game, and this is evident as soon as the game loads.\n\nThe base game area features 5x3 reels and forms winning combinations through clusters instead of regular lines or ways to win. The reels feature Wild combinations, stacked multipliers, and free spins that make for even larger game areas to explore (8x8 reels). This is the type of game that pays off frequently, but not necessarily a lot in a single round.\n\nBetsoft has been producing excellent online casino games since 1999. Over the years, this British slot developer has built a reputation for slick 3D graphics and incredible gameplay. Of course, you don't get fantastic bonus features and stunning animations without a bit of volatility along the way. This new video slot game ChilliPop retains some of that animation. There are no expensive intro sequences or winning animations, just an authentic Mexican-style background and some fun chili characters in the reel positions.\n\nA Mexican-themed graphic\nThe free ChilliPop slot machine plays on a 3x5 reel set. Coins can be adjusted from 0.01 to 1.00, and there is a betting set worth 50 coins per round. Unlike classic paylines, ChilliPop pays out in Cluster Wins, revealed in our ChilliPop slot review. All you have to do is match at least three identical symbols horizontally or vertically on the reels. All clusters will explode, allowing the above symbols to fall into place. If you love volatility and excitement, this is probably the online slot game for you.\n\nThe game's theme draws inspiration from Mexican cuisine, providing various fresh ingredients on the reels as symbols. These include tomatoes, garlic, peppers of various colors, and onions, which are all turned into crazy characters, making the game even more fun to play.\n\nYour bets in this game are designed to cover all possible combinations that can be formed. To do this, you will be required to have 50 coins in use. The part that depends on you is the coin's value, which starts at a minimum of € 0.01 and goes up from there. The minimum allowed bet amount is € 0.50 per round, but you can also spend much more if you can afford it.\n\nSlot machine features and symbols\nRegarding winning combinations, rewards will be in exchange for your symbol groups, and of course, they will be higher if there are more of the right type of symbols. You get help from the interesting Wild symbol, along with stacked multipliers, so the rewards can quickly add up. However, you shouldn't expect a big reward. After all, the slot considers a mega win when it returns 60 times the bet amount.\n\nRegarding RTP, I would expect that the game is in the right region, around 95% or 96%, like many other Betsoft games. Before a basic game spin, you have the opportunity to purchase 10 free spins. The cost is indicated in the Feature Buy box. This means that you don't have to activate the bonus game in the usual way.\n\nIf you want to have the chance to activate the bonus in a more conventional way, you will need to find the scatter donkeys. Three or more donkeys will activate free spins. The more scatters you hit in a cluster, the more spins you earn. Three scatters give you five free spins, while four scatters give you six free spins. If you cover all 15 reel positions in the scatters, you will win 26 free spins.\n\nDuring free spins, every additional donkey you manage to land will be added to the ‘Mule Trail.' As you collect more donkeys, your game area expands. So, the more donkeys you collect, the more money you can win.\n\nThe piñata is the wild symbol in this slot. It will replace all regular symbols except for the scatters. If a Wild piñata forms one of your clusters, it will multiply your win by the number of Wild piñatas +1. You will also earn a special bonus win if you get many piñatas at once. This way, you can win a jackpot worth 1000 times your total bet.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nAs we head to Mexico in our ChilliPop online slot review, we take a trip to the Land of the Dead in the fantastic game Esqueleto Explosivo by Thunderkick. Based on the Mexican Day of the Dead festival, Esqueleto Explosivo uses a funky cascading reels feature.\n\nThe symbols are all colorful skulls that fall from the screen during a spin. Winning combinations explode and are replaced by symbols sitting above. Each consecutive winning spin earns a multiplier that increases from 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, and 32x.",

Tre o più muli attiveranno i giri gratuiti. Più scatters si colpiscono in un cluster, più giri si guadagnano. Tre scatters vi danno cinque giri gratis, mentre quattro scatters vi danno sei giri gratis. Se coprirai le 15 posizioni delle bobine negli scatters vincerai 26 giri gratis.\nDurante il gioco dei giri gratis, ogni ulteriore mulo che riuscirai ad atterrare si aggiungerà alla ‘Mule Trail’. Man mano che raccoglierai altri muli, la tua area di gioco si espanderà. Quindi, più muli raccoglierai, più soldi potrai vincere.\nLa pignatta è il simbolo wild in questa slot. Sostituirà tutti i simboli regolari, tranne le sparpagliate. Se una pignatta Wild forma uno dei vostri cluster, moltiplicherà la vostra vincita per il numero di pignatte Wild +1. Guadagnerai anche una speciale vincita bonus se otterrai molte piñata in una sola volta. In questo modo è possibile vincere un jackpot del valore di 1000 volte la tua puntata totale.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nMentre andiamo in Messico nella nostra recensione della slot online ChilliPop, facciamo un viaggio nella Città dei Morti nel fantastico gioco Esqueleto Explosivo di Thunderkick. Basato sul festival del Giorno dei Morti messicano, Esqueleto Explosivo utilizza una funky funzione di bobine a cascata.\nI simboli sono tutti teschi colorati che cadono dallo schermo durante una rotazione. Le combinazioni vincenti esplodono e vengono sostituite da simboli seduti sopra. Ogni Spin consecutivo vincente guadagna un moltiplicatore che aumenta da 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x e 32x.\n\n        ",

With cluster-based winning combinations, lots of reel action, and high-quality graphics, it should be a great choice for many players. Once again, Betsoft proves in this game to be able to design a visually stunning slot game in a cinematic style, and it is noticeable as soon as it loads.\nThe base game area has 5x3 reels and will form winning combinations through clusters rather than regular lines or ways to win. On these reels, there will still be Wild combinations, as well as stacked multipliers, and free spins that have even larger game areas to explore (8x8 reels). It's the kind of game to pay out often, not necessarily a lot in a single round.\nBetSoft has been producing top-notch online casino games since 1999. Over the years, the British slot developer has built a reputation for slick 3D graphics and incredible gameplay.\nNaturally, you don't get fantastic bonus features and stunning animations without a little volatility along the way. The new video slot ChilliPop actually retains some animation. There are no expensive intro sequences and animations win on the reels. Instead, we get only an authentic Mexican style background and some fun chili characters in the reel positions.\nA wholly Mexican graphic\nThe free ChilliPop slot machine is played on a set of 3x5 reels. Coins can be adjusted from 0.01 to 1.00. There is a set bet of 50 coins per spin.\nThere are no classic paylines in ChilliPop. Instead, our ChilliPop slot review has shown that the game pays in 'Cluster Wins'. All you have to do is match at least three identical symbols vertically or horizontally on the reels. All clusters will explode, allowing the symbols above to fall into their place. If you love volatility and excitement, this is probably the online slot for you.\nIt's a Mexican cuisine-inspired theme, providing various fresh ingredients on the reels as symbols.

You get help with this from the interesting Wild symbol, along with stacked multipliers, so rewards can quickly add up. However, don't expect a big reward to come your way. The slot considers a mega win when it returns 60 times the stake, after all.\nAs for RTP, I would expect the game to be in the right region, around 95% or 96%, like many other Betsoft games.\nBefore a basic game spin, you will have the chance to buy 10 free spins. The price is listed in the Buy feature box. This means you don't have to activate the bonus game in the usual way.\nIf you want to have the chance to activate the bonus in a more conventional way, you will need to find the mule scatters. Three or more mules will activate the free spins. The more scatters hit in a cluster, the more spins you earn. Three scatters give you five free spins, while four scatters give you six free spins. If you cover all 15 reel positions in the scatters, you win 26 free spins.\nDuring the free spins game, every additional mule you manage to land will be added to the 'Mule Trail'. As you collect more mules, your game area will expand. So, the more mules you collect, the more money you can win.\nThe piñata is the wild symbol in this slot. It will substitute for all regular symbols except scattered ones. If a Wild piñata forms one of your clusters, it will multiply your win by the number of Wild piñatas +1. You will also earn a special bonus win if you get many piñata all at once. This way, you can win a jackpot worth 1000 times your total bet.\nOther similar slot machines\nAs we go to Mexico in our ChilliPop online slot review, we take a trip to the City of the Dead in Thunderkick's fantastic game Esqueleto Explosivo.

With cluster-based winning combinations, lots of reel action, and high-quality graphics, it should be a great choice for many players. Once again, Betsoft proves in this game to be able to design a visually stunning slot game in a cinematic style, and it is noticeable as soon as it loads.\nThe base game area has 5x3 reels and will form winning combinations through clusters rather than regular lines or ways to win. On these reels, there will still be Wild combinations, as well as stacked multipliers, and free spins that have even larger game areas to explore (8x8 reels). It's the kind of game to pay out often, not necessarily a lot in a single round.\nBetSoft has been producing top-notch online casino games since 1999. Over the years, the British slot developer has built a reputation for slick 3D graphics and incredible gameplay.\nNaturally, you don't get fantastic bonus features and stunning animations without a little volatility along the way. The new video slot ChilliPop actually retains some animation. There are no expensive intro sequences and animations win on the reels. Instead, we get only an authentic Mexican style background and some fun chili characters in the reel positions.\nA wholly Mexican graphic\nThe free ChilliPop slot machine is played on a set of 3x5 reels. Coins can be adjusted from 0.01 to 1.00. There is a set bet of 50 coins per spin.\nThere are no classic paylines in ChilliPop. Instead, our ChilliPop slot review has shown that the game pays in 'Cluster Wins'. All you have to do is match at least three identical symbols vertically or horizontally on the reels. All clusters will explode, allowing the symbols above to fall into their place. If you love volatility and excitement, this is probably the online slot for you.\nIt's a Mexican cuisine-inspired theme, providing various fresh ingredients on the reels as symbols. They include tomatoes, garlic, peppers of various colors, and onions, and together they are used to create the perfect salsa. Even these are all transformed into wacky characters, so there's plenty to do in the game while playing.\nYour bets in this game are designed to cover all possible combinations that can be formed, and to do so you will be required to have 50 coins in use. The part that depends on you is the value of the coin, which starts from a minimum of €0.01 and only goes up from there. The minimum amount allowed for a bet is €0.50 per spin, but you can also spend a lot more if you can afford it.\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nAs for the winning combinations, the rewards will come in exchange for your groups of symbols, and of course, they will be higher if there are more symbols of the right kind. You get help with this from the interesting Wild symbol, along with stacked multipliers, so rewards can quickly add up. However, don't expect a big reward to come your way. The slot considers a mega win when it returns 60 times the stake, after all.\nAs for RTP, I would expect the game to be in the right region, around 95% or 96%, like many other Betsoft games.\nBefore a basic game spin, you will have the chance to buy 10 free spins. The price is listed in the Buy feature box. This means you don't have to activate the bonus game in the usual way.\nIf you want to have the chance to activate the bonus in a more conventional way, you will need to find the mule scatters. Three or more mules will activate the free spins. The more scatters hit in a cluster, the more spins you earn. Three scatters give you five free spins, while four scatters give you six free spins. If you cover all 15 reel positions in the scatters, you win 26 free spins.\nDuring the free spins game, every additional mule you manage to land will be added to the 'Mule Trail'. As you collect more mules, your game area will expand. So, the more mules you collect, the more money you can win.\nThe piñata is the wild symbol in this slot. It will substitute for all regular symbols except scattered ones. If a Wild piñata forms one of your clusters, it will multiply your win by the number of Wild piñatas +1. You will also earn a special bonus win if you get many piñata all at once. This way, you can win a jackpot worth 1000 times your total bet.\nOther similar slot machines\nAs we go to Mexico in our ChilliPop online slot review, we take a trip to the City of the Dead in Thunderkick's fantastic game Esqueleto Explosivo. Based on the Mexican Day of the Dead festival, Esqueleto Explosivo uses a funky cascading reel feature.\nThe symbols are all colored skulls that fall from the screen during a rotation. Winning combinations explode and are replaced by symbols sitting on top. Each consecutive winning spin earns a multiplier that increases from 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, and 32x.\n            ",

One thing that sets Chilli Pop apart from other online slot games is its unique cluster-based winning combinations. No more boring paylines or ways to win - this game offers a new experience altogether. </p> <p>So, how does it work? To win, you'll need to match at least three identical symbols vertically or horizontally on the reels. The more symbols you match, the higher your payout will be. But wait, there's more! When you form a cluster, all the symbols in it will explode, allowing the symbols above to fall into their place. This means you could land multiple wins in one spin. </p> <p>It's easy to get the hang of, and the game is incredibly engaging and entertaining. You'll find yourself cheering on the chillies and other symbols as they cascade down the reels. Just make sure you're not too hungry while playing, or you might mistake the symbols for edible treats. Not that we would blame you - they look delicious!</p>\"\n}"

Winning combinations are formed by matching at least three identical symbols vertically or horizontally on the reels. All clusters will explode, allowing the symbols above to fall into their place.\n\nGraphics and visual design\n\nChilli Pop has high-quality graphics and visually stunning design in a cinematic style that depicts an authentic Mexican theme. Instead of expensive intro sequences and animations, the game backdrop and characters provide players with an immersive experience.\n\nFree spins and expanding game areas\n\nTo activate the free spins feature, you need to find three or more mule scatters. The more mules you hit in a cluster, the more spins you earn, starting with five for three scatters to 26 for all 15 reel positions. Every additional mule you land during the free spins game is added to the Mule Trail, expanding the playing area and increasing your chances of winning.\n\nMexican cuisine-inspired theme\n\nChilli Pop has a Mexican cuisine-inspired theme, with fresh ingredients such as tomatoes, garlic, peppers of various colors, and onions, used to create the perfect salsa. All symbols are transformed into quirky characters, providing players with an exciting and playful experience.\n\nFrequency of payouts\n\nChilli Pop is designed to pay out often but not necessarily a lot in a single round, making it suitable for beginners or anyone looking for a low to medium volatility slot game. The slot considers a mega win when it returns 60 times your stake, after all.\n\nBetting options and coin values\n\nChilli Pop has a wide range of betting options, covering all possible combinations that can be formed. Players are required to have 50 coins in use, with the value of the coin ranging from a minimum of €0.01 up to any maximum amount depending on the player's budget. The minimum amount allowed for a bet is €0.50 per spin.\n\nMultiplier feature (Wild piñata)\n\nThe piñata is the wild symbol in Chilli Pop, substituting for all regular symbols except scattered ones. If a Wild piñata forms one of your clusters, it will multiply your win by the number of Wild piñatas +1. You will also earn a special bonus win if you get many piñata all at once, allowing players to potentially win a jackpot worth 1000 times their total bet.\n\nBonus features (Mule Trail)\n\nChilli Pop's unique bonus feature is the Mule Trail, activated by collecting additional mules during the free spins game. As players collect more mules, the game area expands, providing players with even more opportunities to win big. The more mules you collect, the more money you can win, making it an exciting and lucrative feature.\n\n        \n            ",

The game includes Wild combinations, stacked multipliers, and free spins that have even larger game areas to explore (8x8 reels).\n\nGraphics and overall game design\n\nChilli Pop features high-quality graphics in a visually stunning cinematic style that stands out as soon as it loads. It provides a wholly Mexican graphic, with authentic Mexican style backgrounds and fun chili characters in the reel positions.\n\nMexican cuisine-inspired theme\n\nChilli Pop is inspired by Mexican cuisine, with symbols on the reels featuring fresh ingredients such as tomatoes, garlic, peppers of various colors, and onions that are used to create the perfect salsa. Every symbol is transformed into a wacky character, to keep the game entertaining.\n\nFrequency and amount of payouts\n\nChilli Pop is designed to pay out often, but not necessarily a lot in a single round. The rewards come in exchange for groups of symbols, and they are higher if there are more symbols of the right kind. The game features a wild symbol and stacked multipliers to help players form winning combinations that can quickly add up. However, it's worth noting that the slot considers a mega win when it returns 60 times the stake.\n\nBetting options and coin values\n\nChilli Pop has a set bet of 50 coins per spin, and players can adjust the value of the coin from a minimum of €0.01. Your bets must cover all possible combinations that can be formed, which means you will be required to have 50 coins in use per spin. The minimum amount allowed for a bet is €0.50 per spin.\n\nCluster-based winning system\n\nChilli Pop doesn't follow a standard payline system. Instead, it pays out in 'Cluster Wins'. All you have to do is match at least three identical symbols either vertically or horizontally on the reels, and clusters will explode, allowing the symbols above to fall into their place. This unique 'Cluster Wins' system is what makes Chilli Pop stand out.\n\nIn-game bonuses and features\n\nBefore a basic game spin, players can buy 10 free spins via the Buy feature box. They can also activate the bonus game through the conventional way by finding mule scatters. Three or more mules will activate the free spins game. The more scatters hit in a cluster, the more spins are earned. During the free spins game, every additional mule will expand the game area, which allows players have the chance to earn more money. Chilli Pop also features a wild symbol and stacked multipliers.\n\nWild symbol and multiplier effects\n\nThe piñata is the wild symbol in Chilli Pop, which will substitute for all regular symbols except scattered ones. A Wild piñata forming one of your clusters will multiply your win by the number of Wild piñatas +1. Players can also earn a special bonus win if they receive many piñatas at once. This way, they can win a jackpot worth 1000 times their total bet.\n\n        \n            ",

With cluster-based winning combinations, lots of reel action, and high-quality graphics, it should be a great choice for many players. Once again, Betsoft proves in this game to be able to design a visually stunning slot game in a cinematic style, and it is noticeable as soon as it loads.\nThe base game area has 5x3 reels and will form winning combinations through clusters rather than regular lines or ways to win. On these reels, there will still be Wild combinations, as well as stacked multipliers, and free spins that have even larger game areas to explore (8x8 reels). It's the kind of game to pay out often, not necessarily a lot in a single round.\nBetSoft has been producing top-notch online casino games since 1999. Over the years, the British slot developer has built a reputation for slick 3D graphics and incredible gameplay.\nNaturally, you don't get fantastic bonus features and stunning animations without a little volatility along the way. The new video slot ChilliPop actually retains some animation. There are no expensive intro sequences and animations win on the reels. Instead, we get only an authentic Mexican style background and some fun chili characters in the reel positions.\nA wholly Mexican graphic\nThe free ChilliPop slot machine is played on a set of 3x5 reels. Coins can be adjusted from 0.01 to 1.00. There is a set bet of 50 coins per spin.\nThere are no classic paylines in ChilliPop. Instead, our ChilliPop slot review has shown that the game pays in 'Cluster Wins'. All you have to do is match at least three identical symbols vertically or horizontally on the reels. All clusters will explode, allowing the symbols above to fall into their place. If you love volatility and excitement, this is probably the online slot for you.\nIt's a Mexican cuisine-inspired theme, providing various fresh ingredients on the reels as symbols. They include tomatoes, garlic, peppers of various colors, and onions, and together they are used to create the perfect salsa. Even these are all transformed into wacky characters, so there's plenty to do in the game while playing.\nYour bets in this game are designed to cover all possible combinations that can be formed, and to do so you will be required to have 50 coins in use. The part that depends on you is the value of the coin, which starts from a minimum of €0.01 and only goes up from there. The minimum amount allowed for a bet is €0.50 per spin, but you can also spend a lot more if you can afford it.\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nAs for the winning combinations, the rewards will come in exchange for your groups of symbols, and of course, they will be higher if there are more symbols of the right kind. You get help with this from the interesting Wild symbol, along with stacked multipliers, so rewards can quickly add up. However, don't expect a big reward to come your way. The slot considers a mega win when it returns 60 times the stake, after all.\nAs for RTP, I would expect the game to be in the right region, around 95% or 96%, like many other Betsoft games.\nBefore a basic game spin, you will have the chance to buy 10 free spins. The price is listed in the Buy feature box. This means you don't have to activate the bonus game in the usual way.\nIf you want to have the chance to activate the bonus in a more conventional way, you will need to find the mule scatters. Three or more mules will activate the free spins. The more scatters hit in a cluster, the more spins you earn. Three scatters give you five free spins, while four scatters give you six free spins. If you cover all 15 reel positions in the scatters, you win 26 free spins.\nDuring the free spins game, every additional mule you manage to land will be added to the 'Mule Trail'. As you collect more mules, your game area will expand. So, the more mules you collect, the more money you can win.\nThe piñata is the wild symbol in this slot. It will substitute for all regular symbols except scattered ones. If a Wild piñata forms one of your clusters, it will multiply your win by the number of Wild piñatas +1. You will also earn a special bonus win if you get many piñata all at once. This way, you can win a jackpot worth 1000 times your total bet.\nOther similar slot machines\nAs we go to Mexico in our ChilliPop online slot review, we take a trip to the City of the Dead in Thunderkick's fantastic game Esqueleto Explosivo. Based on the Mexican Day of the Dead festival, Esqueleto Explosivo uses a funky cascading reel feature.\nThe symbols are all colored skulls that fall from the screen during a rotation. Winning combinations explode and are replaced by symbols sitting on top. Each consecutive winning spin earns a multiplier that increases from 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, and 32x.\n            ",

With cluster-based winning combinations, lots of reel action, and high-quality graphics, it should be a great choice for many players. Once again, Betsoft proves in this game to be able to design a visually stunning slot game in a cinematic style, and it is noticeable as soon as it loads.\nThe base game area has 5x3 reels and will form winning combinations through clusters rather than regular lines or ways to win. On these reels, there will still be Wild combinations, as well as stacked multipliers, and free spins that have even larger game areas to explore (8x8 reels). It's the kind of game to pay out often, not necessarily a lot in a single round.\nBetSoft has been producing top-notch online casino games since 1999. Over the years, the British slot developer has built a reputation for slick 3D graphics and incredible gameplay.\nNaturally, you don't get fantastic bonus features and stunning animations without a little volatility along the way. The new video slot ChilliPop actually retains some animation. There are no expensive intro sequences and animations win on the reels. Instead, we get only an authentic Mexican style background and some fun chili characters in the reel positions.\nA wholly Mexican graphic\nThe free ChilliPop slot machine is played on a set of 3x5 reels. Coins can be adjusted from 0.01 to 1.00. There is a set bet of 50 coins per spin.\nThere are no classic paylines in ChilliPop. Instead, our ChilliPop slot review has shown that the game pays in 'Cluster Wins'. All you have to do is match at least three identical symbols vertically or horizontally on the reels. All clusters will explode, allowing the symbols above to fall into their place. If you love volatility and excitement, this is probably the online slot for you.\nIt's a Mexican cuisine-inspired theme, providing various fresh ingredients on the reels as symbols. They include tomatoes, garlic, peppers of various colors, and onions, and together they are used to create the perfect salsa. Even these are all transformed into wacky characters, so there's plenty to do in the game while playing.\nYour bets in this game are designed to cover all possible combinations that can be formed, and to do so you will be required to have 50 coins in use. The part that depends on you is the value of the coin, which starts from a minimum of €0.01 and only goes up from there. The minimum amount allowed for a bet is €0.50 per spin, but you can also spend a lot more if you can afford it.\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nAs for the winning combinations, the rewards will come in exchange for your groups of symbols, and of course, they will be higher if there are more symbols of the right kind. You get help with this from the interesting Wild symbol, along with stacked multipliers, so rewards can quickly add up. However, don't expect a big reward to come your way. The slot considers a mega win when it returns 60 times the stake, after all.\nAs for RTP, I would expect the game to be in the right region, around 95% or 96%, like many other Betsoft games.\nBefore a basic game spin, you will have the chance to buy 10 free spins. The price is listed in the Buy feature box. This means you don't have to activate the bonus game in the usual way.\nIf you want to have the chance to activate the bonus in a more conventional way, you will need to find the mule scatters. Three or more mules will activate the free spins. The more scatters hit in a cluster, the more spins you earn. Three scatters give you five free spins, while four scatters give you six free spins. If you cover all 15 reel positions in the scatters, you win 26 free spins.\nDuring the free spins game, every additional mule you manage to land will be added to the 'Mule Trail'. As you collect more mules, your game area will expand. So, the more mules you collect, the more money you can win.\nThe piñata is the wild symbol in this slot. It will substitute for all regular symbols except scattered ones. If a Wild piñata forms one of your clusters, it will multiply your win by the number of Wild piñatas +1. You will also earn a special bonus win if you get many piñata all at once. This way, you can win a jackpot worth 1000 times your total bet.\nOther similar slot machines\nAs we go to Mexico in our ChilliPop online slot review, we take a trip to the City of the Dead in Thunderkick's fantastic game Esqueleto Explosivo. Based on the Mexican Day of the Dead festival, Esqueleto Explosivo uses a funky cascading reel feature.\nThe symbols are all colored skulls that fall from the screen during a rotation. Winning combinations explode and are replaced by symbols sitting on top. Each consecutive winning spin earns a multiplier that increases from 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, and 32x.\n            ",
