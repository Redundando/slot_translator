The minimum bet is 15 tokens, and each of them has a value chosen by the player, ranging from €0.01 to €0.50. Players can activate Autoplay, with a number of Spins ranging from 10 to 500, and if desired, they can decide to activate the Fast Spin, so that the fall of symbols is accelerated. The volatility is low, which means that small amounts are won but very frequently. The RTP value is high and is set at 96.79%. A part of the bet goes towards the Jackpot of €2,500 that is displayed on a sign at the top of the screen.\n\nSymbol design and animations\n\nThe Calaveras Explosivas slot game has skulls as its main theme, with each skull being given a unique stylized and colourful design while their eyes move. The golden skull is the Wild symbol, and the white skull with roses in place of the eyes is the Scatter and is the symbol that is worth the most, paying up to 1,000 tokens with the minimum bet. The symbols fall from above, and in the case of winning combinations, explode and are replaced by others. The multiplier increases by x1 with each replacement and can reach a maximum of x128x after the eighth consecutive cascade.\n\nVisuals and audio\n\nHabanero did an excellent job on the graphics of Calaveras Explosivas, using bright colours for each skull, and the game's background is a typical street in a Mexican village, captured at night, with flags running from one balcony to another, and a cat watching the game from a high ledge. The music is a typical melody from Mexican culture, with the sound of maracas and acoustic guitars in the foreground.\n\nWinning combinations and multipliers\n\nTo win in Calaveras Explosivas, players need to get at least three same symbols that touch each other. The maximum number of symbols that can form a winning combination is twenty. Winning symbols are replaced by others, and with each replacement, the multiplier increases by x1 and can reach a maximum of x128x after the eighth consecutive cascade. The golden skull is the Wild symbol, which replaces all symbols except for the special ones. The white skull with roses in place of the eyes is the Scatter and is the symbol that is worth the most, paying up to 1,000 tokens with the minimum bet.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nCalaveras Explosivas has a low volatility, which means that small amounts are won but very frequently. The RTP value is high and is set at 96.79%. A part of the bet goes towards the Jackpot of €2,500 that is displayed on a sign at the top of the screen.\n\n        \n            ",
