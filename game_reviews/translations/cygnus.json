Developed by ELK Studios, this slot game boasts 6 reels and up to a whopping 262,144 ways to win. Starting at a minimum bet of €0.10, players can go all the way up to €100 for a chance to win the maximum jackpot of €500,000.\n\nAt first glance, Cygnus may seem like just another Egyptian-themed game, but it's so much more than that. Its name refers to the star in the Cygnus constellation, which is said to have a cosmic connection to the pyramids of Giza. According to legend, aliens from the Cygnus constellation may have even played a part in building these wonders of the world.\n\nAs for the game itself, players will be impressed by the classic Egyptian design, complete with a majestic pyramid and a starry night sky. The six reels are positioned between two pillars, with the right-hand pillar displaying some interesting multipliers.\n\nThe gameplay is not linear, but works on an \"Avalanche\" system that increases the number of rows of symbols on each reel, ultimately leading to an incredible 262,144 ways to win. The highest-value symbol is the 7, which pays out 30 times the bet when it appears on all six reels.\n\nThe range of bets in Cygnus starts at just 10 cents and can go up to €100, with the option to use the Autoplay function for up to 100 automatic spins. The game's high volatility means that wins may not come as often, but when they do, they can be quite substantial. \n\nWith an RTP of 96.1% and a success rate of 23%, Cygnus is a game that can reward the daring ones with decent and consistent payouts. So, if you're ready to take on the mysteries of the stars and the secrets of the pyramids, give Cygnus a try.",

However, despite the theme’s reference to Ancient Egypt, Cygnus is different from most of the slots we've tried up to this point: the game's title refers to the star of the Swan, part of the Northern Cross constellation, which appears to be aligned precisely with the pyramids of Giza. According to the game sheet, this alignment creates a sort of cosmic connection between the sky and the earth, fueling legends that aliens from the Northern Cross were the ones who built the pyramids of Giza.\nGalaxies and Ancient Egypt, therefore, come together in a game that has many truly interesting surprises in store.\nThe game has the classic look of Egyptian-themed slots, with the game grid placed in front of the entrance of a majestic pyramid, framed by palm trees and a constellation that glitters in the night sky.

The game uses the 'Avalanche' system to increase the number of rows on each reel, thereby increasing the ways to win up to 262,144. There are various symbols, including four types of gems (with low values), an ibis, a camel, and a cat, which have high payouts. The gameplay's highest value symbol is the number 7, which pays out 30 times the bet when it appears on all six reels.\n\nTheme\n\nDespite the game's Ancient Egypt reference, Cygnus is unique in that it combines the galaxies with Ancient Egypt. The game's title refers to the star of the Swan, part of the Northern Cross constellation, which appears to align precisely with the pyramids of Giza. According to the game archive, this alignment creates a cosmic connection between the sky and the earth, fostering legends that aliens from the Northern Cross built the pyramids of Giza. The game's grid is placed in front of a majestic pyramid, framed by palm trees and a constellation that glitters in the night sky.\n\nPayouts\n\nCygnus features a 96.1% RTP associated with a 23% success rate. The maximum win per spin is 5,000 times the bet, and the game's maximum jackpot is €500,000. The game features four types of gems with low payouts, an ibis, a camel, and a cat with high values. The number 7 symbol has the highest value and pays out 30 times the bet when it appears on all six reels.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nCygnus has a high volatility rating of 8/10, meaning wins are infrequent but significant amounts of money can be won. The RTP (return to player) is 96.1%, making the game fairly profitable despite the high volatility. The game's betting range starts at just 10 cents and goes up to a maximum of €100 per spin. The Autoplay feature is also available, allowing players to set up to 100 automatic spins.\n\nOverall experience\n\nCygnus is an exciting and unique game that manages to combine galaxies and Ancient Egypt. The game's Egyptian-themed look and feel, coupled with the novelty of the Northern Cross constellation, make for an interesting gaming experience. The game's use of the 'Avalanche' system to increase the number of rows and ways to win is unique and adds to the overall appeal of the game. While the game has high volatility, the possibility of winning substantial amounts of money combined with a fairly high RTP make Cygnus a game worth playing for experienced players.\n\n        \n            ",

Here's a review of the slot game \"Cygnus\" that you won't want to miss!\n\nCygnus\nGeneral Information\nSoftware: ELK Studios\nReels: 6 x 4 rows\nPaylines: up to 262,144 ways to win\nMinimum bet amount: €0.10\nMaximum bet amount: €100\nMaximum payout: 5,000 times the bet\nReturn to Player (RTP): 96.1%\nMaximum jackpot: €500,000\nVolatility: High\nKey Features\nAt first glance, Cygnus, one of the latest offerings from provider ELK Studios, may seem like just another slot machine to add to the already extensive list of Egyptian-themed games. However, despite the theme’s reference to Ancient Egypt, Cygnus is different from most of the slots we've tried up to this point: the game's title refers to the star of the Swan, part of the Northern Cross constellation, which appears to be aligned precisely with the pyramids of Giza. According to the game sheet, this alignment creates a sort of cosmic connection between the sky and the earth, fueling legends that aliens from the Northern Cross were the ones who built the pyramids of Giza.\nGalaxies and Ancient Egypt, therefore, come together in a game that has many truly interesting surprises in store.\nThe game has the classic look of Egyptian-themed slots, with the game grid placed in front of the entrance of a majestic pyramid, framed by palm trees and a constellation that glitters in the night sky. What's striking are the six reels positioned between two pillars, which grow taller with four rows of symbols. Even before the reels start spinning, the right pillar displays some very interesting multipliers.\nGameplay\nInitially, the game features 4,096 ways to win, and to get winning combinations, you must align at least three identical symbols on adjacent reels starting from the first reel on the left, and then progress rightward.\nThe gameplay is not linear, but it works with a system called \"Avalanche\" that increases the number of rows with symbols on each reel, bringing them up to 8 and increasing the ways to win up to an incredible 262,144!\nThe symbol with the absolute highest value is the number 7, which pays out 30 times the bet when it appears on all six reels. Other Cygnus symbols include four types of gems (with low values), an ibis, a camel, and a cat, which instead have fairly high payouts.\nCygnus: RTP, Volatility, and Betting Range\nAmong the details of this unique slot, we have a betting range that starts at just 10 cents and goes up to a maximum of €100 per spin. The Autoplay feature is also available, allowing you to set up to 100 automatic spins.\nAccording to ELK itself, Cygnus has a volatility rating of 8/10, which is very high, meaning that wins are infrequent but the possibility of bringing home significant amounts of money is there.\nThe RTP (return to player) is 96.1%, associated with a 23% success rate: this means that despite the high volatility, Cygnus is a game where you win fairly regularly and the amounts are generally quite substantial.\n            ",

Here's a review of the slot game \"Cygnus\" that you won't want to miss!\n\nCygnus\nGeneral Information\nSoftware: ELK Studios\nReels: 6 x 4 rows\nPaylines: up to 262,144 ways to win\nMinimum bet amount: €0.10\nMaximum bet amount: €100\nMaximum payout: 5,000 times the bet\nReturn to Player (RTP): 96.1%\nMaximum jackpot: €500,000\nVolatility: High\nKey Features\nAt first glance, Cygnus, one of the latest offerings from provider ELK Studios, may seem like just another slot machine to add to the already extensive list of Egyptian-themed games. However, despite the theme’s reference to Ancient Egypt, Cygnus is different from most of the slots we've tried up to this point: the game's title refers to the star of the Swan, part of the Northern Cross constellation, which appears to be aligned precisely with the pyramids of Giza. According to the game sheet, this alignment creates a sort of cosmic connection between the sky and the earth, fueling legends that aliens from the Northern Cross were the ones who built the pyramids of Giza.\nGalaxies and Ancient Egypt, therefore, come together in a game that has many truly interesting surprises in store.\nThe game has the classic look of Egyptian-themed slots, with the game grid placed in front of the entrance of a majestic pyramid, framed by palm trees and a constellation that glitters in the night sky. What's striking are the six reels positioned between two pillars, which grow taller with four rows of symbols. Even before the reels start spinning, the right pillar displays some very interesting multipliers.\nGameplay\nInitially, the game features 4,096 ways to win, and to get winning combinations, you must align at least three identical symbols on adjacent reels starting from the first reel on the left, and then progress rightward.\nThe gameplay is not linear, but it works with a system called \"Avalanche\" that increases the number of rows with symbols on each reel, bringing them up to 8 and increasing the ways to win up to an incredible 262,144!\nThe symbol with the absolute highest value is the number 7, which pays out 30 times the bet when it appears on all six reels. Other Cygnus symbols include four types of gems (with low values), an ibis, a camel, and a cat, which instead have fairly high payouts.\nCygnus: RTP, Volatility, and Betting Range\nAmong the details of this unique slot, we have a betting range that starts at just 10 cents and goes up to a maximum of €100 per spin. The Autoplay feature is also available, allowing you to set up to 100 automatic spins.\nAccording to ELK itself, Cygnus has a volatility rating of 8/10, which is very high, meaning that wins are infrequent but the possibility of bringing home significant amounts of money is there.\nThe RTP (return to player) is 96.1%, associated with a 23% success rate: this means that despite the high volatility, Cygnus is a game where you win fairly regularly and the amounts are generally quite substantial.\n            ",
