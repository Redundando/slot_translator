The game is set underwater with some beautiful sea creatures as symbols. They are designed with a lush color scheme that will surely dazzle you. Overall, it is a pretty nice game that draws you in as soon as it loads.\nUnderwater slot games are always popular, both for players and developers. Ancient cities and mythology are also popular, so when the two things are combined, with the mystery of the lost city of Atlantis evoking thoughts of priceless treasures, it's no wonder that Atlantis appears once again on the reels of a slot game, this time from ReelPlay.\nAs expected, a watery palette of blues has been used with great effect by the game designers.

The row of four reels at the top shows the symbols that can also lock into the win result.\nGenerally, megaways slots do not offer extremely lucrative symbols, due to the feature of consecutive wins, so there may be more than one win resulting from a single spin.\nThe Atlantis Megaways slot has a wild and a scatter. The latter is part of a respin game that we will describe shortly. As for the most profitable symbol, it is that of Poseidon, a pair of shiny eyes and everything else, which pays 100x for six of the same.\nAll other image symbols pay between 1.2 and 5 on the winning bet for the optimal result of six matches.\nThe main bonus feature is the Jackpot Respins, which is triggered when six or more scatters fall on the reels. Each scatter symbol carries a prize relative to the triggering bet.\nWhen this happens, the scatters stay in place while the remaining positions go for three respins. Each time another treasure chest is added to the reels, the respins reset to three.\nIn this game, you can win one of the four jackpot prizes: 10x, 50x, 250x, and 2000x multiplied by the winning bet.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAt first, however, the game seems to offer a series of promising twists and turns.

The game features a respin bonus feature, scatters that bring cash prizes, and a wild symbol. As usual, the megaways bring cascading wins on 117,649 ways to win.\nAtlantis Megaways is an online slot developed by ReelPlay. The features include cascading reels and medium volatility, along with a respin bonus that offers up to four jackpot prizes. There are up to 117,649 ways to win, and a top value of 2000x your bet. The RTP of this medium volatility slot is 96.10%.\nA mysterious and adventurous graphics\nAtlantis Megaways is a ReelPlay online slot that has a lively look. The game is set underwater with some beautiful sea creatures as symbols. They are designed with a lush color scheme that will surely dazzle you. Overall, it is a pretty nice game that draws you in as soon as it loads.\nUnderwater slot games are always popular, both for players and developers. Ancient cities and mythology are also popular, so when the two things are combined, with the mystery of the lost city of Atlantis evoking thoughts of priceless treasures, it's no wonder that Atlantis appears once again on the reels of a slot game, this time from ReelPlay.\nAs expected, a watery palette of blues has been used with great effect by the game designers. The background of the reels ranges from the lightest blue to the deepest midnight color, allowing the decorative elements of the playing card icons to really stand out. They are intertwined with strands of seaweed, helping to reinforce the game's aquatic theme.\nDesign-wise, we have a splendid display of the underwater world, courtesy of the Reel Play studios. The background offers a glimpse into the pillaged world of the lost civilization, completely adorned with imposing structures and statues.\nOn the reel-set are the sea creatures, high cards, and royals, and the symbols of Poseidon, the wild and the scatter, which are represented by an ancient temple and a chest full of glowing loot.\nThe Atlantis Megaways slot offers dynamic reel action that is not lagging behind any of the best slots of the same style out there. Players will discover the magnificent cascading win mechanism every time a win occurs.\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nYour adventure can begin with the push of the spin button, which can be seen on the right side of the reel-set. Below the spin button is the autoplay mode button, which allows you to set up the game for a hands-free adventure on the reels.\nBut before you do all this, it would be smart to find out the total bet per spin that has been set as default by the casino where you are playing Atlantis Megaways slot. The bet amount is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen and you can change the bet by selecting the stack of coins in the lower right corner.\nBets range from €0.20 to €100.00 per spin, offering a nice range of choices. Regardless of the amount you select, the game will always play with the potential to reach the maximum number of megaways, which is 117,649.\nTo view game information related to Atlantis Megaways, select the menu symbol with three dashes in the lower left corner. Here you can check payouts, game rules, and information on bonus features.\nThe results of megaways slot wins must start from the leftmost reel and extend to the right.\nHere we need three or more matching symbols to fall on consecutive reels. The row of four reels at the top shows the symbols that can also lock into the win result.\nGenerally, megaways slots do not offer extremely lucrative symbols, due to the feature of consecutive wins, so there may be more than one win resulting from a single spin.\nThe Atlantis Megaways slot has a wild and a scatter. The latter is part of a respin game that we will describe shortly. As for the most profitable symbol, it is that of Poseidon, a pair of shiny eyes and everything else, which pays 100x for six of the same.\nAll other image symbols pay between 1.2 and 5 on the winning bet for the optimal result of six matches.\nThe main bonus feature is the Jackpot Respins, which is triggered when six or more scatters fall on the reels. Each scatter symbol carries a prize relative to the triggering bet.\nWhen this happens, the scatters stay in place while the remaining positions go for three respins. Each time another treasure chest is added to the reels, the respins reset to three.\nIn this game, you can win one of the four jackpot prizes: 10x, 50x, 250x, and 2000x multiplied by the winning bet.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAt first, however, the game seems to offer a series of promising twists and turns. Some lucky players can win the ultimate prize of 5000 times the winning bet and this is likely to occur with the help of multipliers, and in this regard, we have 50x for the highest possible value.\n            ",

As usual, the megaways bring cascading wins on 117,649 ways to win.\nAtlantis Megaways is an online slot developed by ReelPlay. The features include cascading reels and medium volatility, along with a respin bonus that offers up to four jackpot prizes. There are up to 117,649 ways to win, and a top value of 2000x your bet. The RTP of this medium volatility slot is 96.10%.\nA mysterious and adventurous graphics\nAtlantis Megaways is a ReelPlay online slot that has a lively look. The game is set underwater with some beautiful sea creatures as symbols. They are designed with a lush color scheme that will surely dazzle you. Overall, it is a pretty nice game that draws you in as soon as it loads.\nUnderwater slot games are always popular, both for players and developers. Ancient cities and mythology are also popular, so when the two things are combined, with the mystery of the lost city of Atlantis evoking thoughts of priceless treasures, it's no wonder that Atlantis appears once again on the reels of a slot game, this time from ReelPlay.\nAs expected, a watery palette of blues has been used with great effect by the game designers. The background of the reels ranges from the lightest blue to the deepest midnight color, allowing the decorative elements of the playing card icons to really stand out. They are intertwined with strands of seaweed, helping to reinforce the game's aquatic theme.\nDesign-wise, we have a splendid display of the underwater world, courtesy of the Reel Play studios. The background offers a glimpse into the pillaged world of the lost civilization, completely adorned with imposing structures and statues.\nOn the reel-set are the sea creatures, high cards, and royals, and the symbols of Poseidon, the wild and the scatter, which are represented by an ancient temple and a chest full of glowing loot.\nThe Atlantis Megaways slot offers dynamic reel action that is not lagging behind any of the best slots of the same style out there. Players will discover the magnificent cascading win mechanism every time a win occurs.\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nYour adventure can begin with the push of the spin button, which can be seen on the right side of the reel-set. Below the spin button is the autoplay mode button, which allows you to set up the game for a hands-free adventure on the reels.\nBut before you do all this, it would be smart to find out the total bet per spin that has been set as default by the casino where you are playing Atlantis Megaways slot. The bet amount is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen and you can change the bet by selecting the stack of coins in the lower right corner.\nBets range from €0.20 to €100.00 per spin, offering a nice range of choices. Regardless of the amount you select, the game will always play with the potential to reach the maximum number of megaways, which is 117,649.\nTo view game information related to Atlantis Megaways, select the menu symbol with three dashes in the lower left corner. Here you can check payouts, game rules, and information on bonus features.\nThe results of megaways slot wins must start from the leftmost reel and extend to the right.\nHere we need three or more matching symbols to fall on consecutive reels. The row of four reels at the top shows the symbols that can also lock into the win result.\nGenerally, megaways slots do not offer extremely lucrative symbols, due to the feature of consecutive wins, so there may be more than one win resulting from a single spin.\nThe Atlantis Megaways slot has a wild and a scatter. The latter is part of a respin game that we will describe shortly. As for the most profitable symbol, it is that of Poseidon, a pair of shiny eyes and everything else, which pays 100x for six of the same.\nAll other image symbols pay between 1.2 and 5 on the winning bet for the optimal result of six matches.\nThe main bonus feature is the Jackpot Respins, which is triggered when six or more scatters fall on the reels. Each scatter symbol carries a prize relative to the triggering bet.\nWhen this happens, the scatters stay in place while the remaining positions go for three respins. Each time another treasure chest is added to the reels, the respins reset to three.\nIn this game, you can win one of the four jackpot prizes: 10x, 50x, 250x, and 2000x multiplied by the winning bet.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAt first, however, the game seems to offer a series of promising twists and turns. Some lucky players can win the ultimate prize of 5000 times the winning bet and this is likely to occur with the help of multipliers, and in this regard, we have 50x for the highest possible value.\n            ",

The game features a respin bonus feature, scatters that bring cash prizes, and a wild symbol. As usual, the megaways bring cascading wins on 117,649 ways to win.\nAtlantis Megaways is an online slot developed by ReelPlay. The features include cascading reels and medium volatility, along with a respin bonus that offers up to four jackpot prizes. There are up to 117,649 ways to win, and a top value of 2000x your bet. The RTP of this medium volatility slot is 96.10%.\nA mysterious and adventurous graphics\nAtlantis Megaways is a ReelPlay online slot that has a lively look. The game is set underwater with some beautiful sea creatures as symbols. They are designed with a lush color scheme that will surely dazzle you. Overall, it is a pretty nice game that draws you in as soon as it loads.\nUnderwater slot games are always popular, both for players and developers. Ancient cities and mythology are also popular, so when the two things are combined, with the mystery of the lost city of Atlantis evoking thoughts of priceless treasures, it's no wonder that Atlantis appears once again on the reels of a slot game, this time from ReelPlay.\nAs expected, a watery palette of blues has been used with great effect by the game designers. The background of the reels ranges from the lightest blue to the deepest midnight color, allowing the decorative elements of the playing card icons to really stand out. They are intertwined with strands of seaweed, helping to reinforce the game's aquatic theme.\nDesign-wise, we have a splendid display of the underwater world, courtesy of the Reel Play studios. The background offers a glimpse into the pillaged world of the lost civilization, completely adorned with imposing structures and statues.\nOn the reel-set are the sea creatures, high cards, and royals, and the symbols of Poseidon, the wild and the scatter, which are represented by an ancient temple and a chest full of glowing loot.\nThe Atlantis Megaways slot offers dynamic reel action that is not lagging behind any of the best slots of the same style out there. Players will discover the magnificent cascading win mechanism every time a win occurs.\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nYour adventure can begin with the push of the spin button, which can be seen on the right side of the reel-set. Below the spin button is the autoplay mode button, which allows you to set up the game for a hands-free adventure on the reels.\nBut before you do all this, it would be smart to find out the total bet per spin that has been set as default by the casino where you are playing Atlantis Megaways slot. The bet amount is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen and you can change the bet by selecting the stack of coins in the lower right corner.\nBets range from €0.20 to €100.00 per spin, offering a nice range of choices. Regardless of the amount you select, the game will always play with the potential to reach the maximum number of megaways, which is 117,649.\nTo view game information related to Atlantis Megaways, select the menu symbol with three dashes in the lower left corner. Here you can check payouts, game rules, and information on bonus features.\nThe results of megaways slot wins must start from the leftmost reel and extend to the right.\nHere we need three or more matching symbols to fall on consecutive reels. The row of four reels at the top shows the symbols that can also lock into the win result.\nGenerally, megaways slots do not offer extremely lucrative symbols, due to the feature of consecutive wins, so there may be more than one win resulting from a single spin.\nThe Atlantis Megaways slot has a wild and a scatter. The latter is part of a respin game that we will describe shortly. As for the most profitable symbol, it is that of Poseidon, a pair of shiny eyes and everything else, which pays 100x for six of the same.\nAll other image symbols pay between 1.2 and 5 on the winning bet for the optimal result of six matches.\nThe main bonus feature is the Jackpot Respins, which is triggered when six or more scatters fall on the reels. Each scatter symbol carries a prize relative to the triggering bet.\nWhen this happens, the scatters stay in place while the remaining positions go for three respins. Each time another treasure chest is added to the reels, the respins reset to three.\nIn this game, you can win one of the four jackpot prizes: 10x, 50x, 250x, and 2000x multiplied by the winning bet.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAt first, however, the game seems to offer a series of promising twists and turns. Some lucky players can win the ultimate prize of 5000 times the winning bet and this is likely to occur with the help of multipliers, and in this regard, we have 50x for the highest possible value.\n            ",
