This slot game brings to life the story of a mega robot that fights against evil, offering players a chance to win big while immersing themselves in a nostalgic atmosphere.\n\nThe superhero-themed graphics of Daltanious are simply fantastic. Its unique cartoonish design is typical of the era, while the various symbols, including robots battling with laser beams and missiles, cyborgs, and aliens, are all iconic elements from the anime series.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, this slot machine boasts numerous bonus features, with some symbols serving as wilds or triggering free spins. It is quite straightforward, enabling a player to win by lining up at least three identical symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost column, to get cash prizes, which can go up to 2,000 coins. The slot's symbols include letters and numbers and various characters and elements from the anime, with the former associated with more frequent but lower prizes, while the latter offer higher rewards.\n\nDaltanious features three diverse symbols that activate different bonus functions, all of which guarantee significant benefits to the player. For instance, the Wild Symbol, acting as a joker, helps create winning combinations resulting in prizes of up to 2,000 coins.

The alien in purple also offers a payout of 250x the bet for a combination of five. Kento Tate, the protagonist and the pilot of the Antares robot, is valued at 750x the bet for a combination of five. The supreme Kloppen symbol also pays the same amount.\n\nThe lion robot, Beralios, serves as the Wild, and the mega robot Daltanious is the Scatter.\n\nFor fans of superheroes, the internet offers plenty of other slot machines featuring their favorite characters, from Superman to Batman and Wonder Woman. You can also find slots based on popular movies and franchises that have made these characters household names.\n            ",
