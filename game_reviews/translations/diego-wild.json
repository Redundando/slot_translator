Among the various functions, there is Autoplay, which allows us to set a predetermined number of automatic spins. However, before doing so, it is necessary to choose the win or loss limits beyond which the game will stop, in our opinion an excellent feature that allows us to play without worries.\nThe volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player is 96.29%.\nA super bonus game\nIn Diego Wild, we find different symbols, some of low value, others much more rewarding. The classic playing card symbols all have the same value and pay less than all the others. Going up we find the bracelet, the vase, the statue, and the chest. Diego is our Wild symbol and replaces all the other icons, except for the Scatter, which is represented by the map. With three of these symbols, we get 5 Free games, with 4 symbols the free spins will be 10, while 5 Scatters will give us 20 Free Games.\nThe bonus game is linked to the free spins, and the setting will move inside the temple, where we will be in front of a 3×5 grid with two additional blocked rows. Whenever the medallion symbol lands on the reels, it will move to the free position of the corresponding reel, unlocking a symbol. In addition, an additional Free Spin will be added.\n \nFrequently Asked Questions\n        ",
