Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Structure\n\nBlack Hole has a unique gameplay structure with six fluorescent capsules on the right-hand side of the screen. The game grid features five reels and three rows with an array of traditional fruit machine symbols such as various fruits, stars, bells, and number sevens. The maximum bet is ten coins, and the automatic mode is available. Theoretical return to player for this game is between 95.25% to 96.55%, which is satisfying and in line with most slot games.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics in Black Hole are impeccable, and the contrast between the old-style fruit machine symbols and the hyper-technological space-themed background is well-executed. The galactic explosions in space give players a feel of modernity, while the fruit symbols recall a classic arcade game feel. The slot game's left-hand side features the game grid, and the bottom features the setting buttons.\n\nSymbols & Betting\n\nBlack Hole uses fruit machine symbols such as various fruits, stars, bells, and number sevens. The least profitable icons include watermelons and cherries, which award a prize equal to fifty times the bet, while the ones that pay the most are represented by the red number seven and strawberries, earning players 1,000 times their betting value for a combination of five. The maximum bet is ten coins, and the automatic mode is available.\n\nBlack Hole Feature\n\nThe black hole feature is the most distinctive feature of Black Hole. When the black hole icon appears, it 'swallows' all the other symbols on the reels, resetting the game. This feature is unique and sets Black Hole apart from other slot games.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nIf you like the space theme of Black Hole, there are several similar slot games that you can explore. For example, The Space Slot Adventure by Rabcat, Interstellar by Bede Gaming, and Space Wars, which features alien beasts among the protagonists. These games offer a fantastic space adventure, much like Black Hole.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Structure\n\nBlack Hole has a traditional structure with five reels and three rows, on which various fruits, stars, bells, and number sevens alternate. The symbols that pay the most are the red number 7 and strawberries. You can bet up to 10 coins and set the game to automatic mode. The theoretical return to player of Black Hole varies from 95.25% to 96.55%.\n\nBlack Hole Icon Feature\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Black Hole is the Black Hole icon. When it appears, it 'swallows' all the other symbols on the reels, resetting the game.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics of Black Hole are a contrast between space with its black holes (hence the title of the game) and classic colorful fruits and flaming number sevens. The game screen structure is peculiar with the reel grid and setting buttons on the left and six counters on the right side of the screen represented as if they were fluorescent space capsules.\n\nBet Limits and Autoplay\n\nYou can bet up to 10 coins and set Black Hole to automatic mode. The game has a theoretical return to player that varies from 95.25% to 96.55%.\n\nSpace Theme Options\n\nIf you enjoyed Black Hole's space theme, there are other similar slot machines with a space theme available at online casinos. For example, The Space Slot Adventure by Rabcat and Interstellar by Bede Gaming offer a fantastic space adventure. Space Wars by NetEnt enriches the theme by inserting alien beasts among the protagonists.\n\n        \n            ",

            "prompt": "\n        Below is a review of the game \"Black Hole\".\n\n        Please provide a detailed prompt for DALLE to create a feature image fitting the game\n        \n        - The image should be in cartoon style\n        - The should feature a happy Maya warrior with glasses\n\n        Review: Black Hole\n\nTheme and Graphics\nBlack Hole is a slot machine produced by the German software house Merkur Gaming that promises originality in both the graphics and gameplay structure.\nThe inspiration for this slot machine is actually a double inspiration: the background is represented by space with its black holes (hence the title of the game), while the symbols that alternate on the reels are clearly a tribute to the tradition of Fruit Machines, consisting of classic colorful fruits and flaming number 7s.\nThe contrast is well executed: while the background recalls hyper-technological games with images of galactic explosions in space, the fruits take us back to an old arcade, sitting in front of an earthly machine.\nEven the structure of the game screen is very peculiar: on the left, we find the reel grid at the top and the setting buttons at the bottom, while on the right side of the screen there are six counters, represented as if they were fluorescent space capsules.\nAt first glance, this might seem a bit confusing, so it's beneficial to try the game in Play for Fun mode, available at most online casinos, to become familiar with the gameplay and practice before betting real money!\n\nMain Features of the Slot\nThe most distinctive feature of Black Hole is without a doubt the counter system on the left of the screen. As for the game grid, it shows a fairly traditional structure, with five reels and three rows, on which various fruits, stars, bells, and number sevens alternate. You can check the payment table beforehand to know the value of the symbols. The symbols that pay the most are represented by the red number 7 and strawberries: a combination of five will earn you 1,000 times the value of your bet! On the other hand, the least profitable icons are watermelons and cherries, which award a prize equal to 50 times the bet.\nYou can bet up to 10 coins and set the game to automatic mode, so you can sit comfortably while the reels spin on their own!\nThe theoretical return to player of Black Hole varies from 95.25% to 96.55%, which is quite satisfying and in line with most slot machine games.\nAn interesting mechanism of this slot machine is represented by the Black Hole icon, which, when it appears, \"swallows\" all the other symbols on the reels, resetting the game.\n\nSimilar Slots to Black Hole\nIf you liked the space theme of Black Hole, you won't have a hard time finding similar slot machines at online casinos!\nFor example, The Space Slot Adventure is a slot machine produced by Rabcat that with simple but interesting gameplay takes you on a tour around the galaxies; Interstellar by Bede Gaming is a very popular game in Italy, which offers a fantastic space adventure, just like Space Wars, which enriches the theme by inserting alien beasts among the protagonists!\n        ",
