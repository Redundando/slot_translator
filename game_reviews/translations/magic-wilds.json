This five-reel slot has 32 paylines in the base game and 100 paylines during the Free Spins feature, where a mysterious magician is the main character. The Magician will transform into a Wild every time he appears on the reels and, if stacked, will replicate onto random reels, thanks to the Astral Projection feature. Follow his spells carefully and win the prizes up for grabs! \n\nMagical Symbols and Features\nWatch as the great Magician transforms your spins into big wins almost every time he appears on the reels:\n\n- The Magician lands in stacks, can cover the entire reel and transforms into the Wild symbol every time he appears, substituting all regular symbols.\n- The haunted wizard palace is the Scatter symbol that triggers the Free Spins feature.\n- The dragon medallion and the book of spells are the main sources of magic for our mysterious wizard. To perform his tricks, he needs to use emerald, ruby, and diamond crystals, as well as various types of runes.\n\nWith the Free Spins feature, the magic reels can reach up to 8 cells, while the Hocus Pocus Scatters give you extra bonuses. \n\nAvailable Bets and Payouts\nYou can start with an initial bet of €0.10 and go up to €50 per spin. Remember that if you get five wilds on a payline, you win 15 times your bet. All three gargoyles pay the same with five times the bet for the maximum combination. Activate the Free Spins feature and unlock all 100 paylines. The Astral Projection feature will also help you win big, together with an RTP of 95.3%. \n\nWhat's my Final Verdict?\nRed Rake Gaming has done a really good job with Magic Wilds, which is available in demo and paid versions at our online casinos. The Magician that becomes wild every time he appears on the reels and the Astral Projection feature that transforms the reels into wild reels add important winning potential. Furthermore, the Free Spins expansion can go up to 8 cells high, which is an additional advantage. As an experienced gambler, I highly recommend trying this slot game out!\n            ",
