Con Flamin’ 7s la società PariPlay ha voluto proprio presentare un tema classico per questo gioco. Il giocatore si trova di fronte a 3 rulli ricchi di simboli e bonus gratificanti. Tra quest’ultimi abbiamo i Wild impilati, i respin e fino a quattro mini giochi tutti da provare per aumentare le vincite. E non dimentichiamo poi i Jolly appiccicosi, che si fissano nelle caselle e possono anche portare con loro dei moltiplicatori. Va precisato che siamo davanti a un titolo che ha media volatilità e un RTP che sta un po’ “stretto”, visto che è stato fissato al 94,02%.\nGrafica della slot\nA livello estetico questa slot si presenta con una cornice decorativa e rulli dorati, proposti con grafica nitida e funzionale. Sembra di ammirare un quadro! Al suo interno abbiamo i simboli più semplici e amati, la Frutta, le Campane, i fortunati numeri 7 e le icone BAR doppie e triple. Molto bella anche l’animazione proposta per le fiamme, pronte a infiammare anche la sua esperienza di gioco a bordo di questa slot.\nCaratteristiche di gioco e funzionalità speciali\nPer vincere in questa slot è bene fare affidamento al valore di ogni combinazioni che si forma: per esempio il Doppio BAR offre 10x la tua puntata, mentre il triplo BAR arriva a 15x. Si sale poi con le Ciliegie che ripagano fino a 20x, la Campana d’oro a 30x e il fortunato numero 7 che ti assegna 50 volte la scommessa originale. Attenzione al moltiplicatore Wild però, perché è il solo a poterti far sognare in grande, visto che ripaga fino a 800x.\nOltre al valore delle icone però non abbiamo altre funzionalità aggiuntive. Il gioco è quindi molto basico, semplice… proprio come le slot terrestri che molti scommettitori hanno avuto modo di provare nelle sale gioco. Ci sono però dei mini game e i respin che ti possono aiutare a sfruttare i tuoi giri vincenti a dovere.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Flamin’ 7s\nSe la semplicità è sempre stata il tuo forte e non ami le nuove slot moderne con tante funzionalità extra e troppi fronzoli sei nel posto giusto! Grazie a Flamin’ 7s si torna davvero a contatto con l’essenza delle slot, quelle formate da 3 rulli, quelle essenziali e capaci di ripagare in denaro e meno in effetto grafico. Tra le slot “vecchio stile” è una delle migliori che abbiamo avuto modo di provare, e sicuramente potrebbe attirare maggiormente i giocatori esperti. Il suo RTP è un po’ limitato, va riconosciuto, poiché è appena sotto la media del settore gambling online. Ma non dimenticare che se hai fortuna puoi vincere oltre 1.400 volte la tua puntata totale con questo titolo!\n",

With Flamin’ 7s, PariPlay presents a classic theme for this game. The player is faced with 3 reels full of symbols and rewarding bonuses. Among these, there are stacked Wilds, respins and up to four mini games to try to increase winnings. Let's not forget about the sticky Jokers, which stick to the boxes and can also bring multipliers with them. It should be noted that this is a title with medium volatility and an RTP that is a bit “tight”, as it has been set at 94.02%.\n\nSlot graphics\nOn an aesthetic level, this slot features a decorative frame and golden reels, with sharp and functional graphics. It's like admiring a painting! Inside, we have the simplest and most beloved symbols, Fruit, Bells, lucky number 7s and double and triple BAR icons. The animation proposed for the flames is also very beautiful, ready to set your gaming experience on fire aboard this slot.\n\nGame features and special functionalities\nTo win in this slot, rely on the value of each combination that forms: for example, the Double BAR offers 10x your bet, while the triple BAR goes up to 15x. Then we have the Cherries, which pay up to 20x, the Golden Bell at 30x and the lucky number 7 that assigns you 50 times the original bet. Pay attention to the Wild multiplier though, as it's the only one that can make you dream big, paying up to 800x.\n\nIn addition to the value of the icons, however, there are no other additional functionalities. The game is therefore very basic, simple... just like the land-based slots that many gamblers have had the chance to try out in gaming halls. However, there are mini games and respins that can help you make the most of your winning spins.\n\nFinal considerations on Flamin’ 7s slot\nIf simplicity has always been your strength and you don't like new modern slots with many extra features and too many frills, you're in the right place! Thanks to Flamin’ 7s, you get in touch with the essence of slots, the ones formed by 3 reels, the essential and capable of paying out in cash and less in graphic effect. Among the \"old-school\" slots, it's one of the best we've had a chance to try, and it could certainly attract more experienced players. Its RTP is a bit limited, it must be recognized, as it's just below the average of the online gambling sector.

With Flamin’ 7s, PariPlay presents a classic theme for this game. The player is faced with 3 reels full of symbols and rewarding bonuses. Among these, there are stacked Wilds, respins and up to four mini games to try to increase winnings. Let's not forget about the sticky Jokers, which stick to the boxes and can also bring multipliers with them. It should be noted that this is a title with medium volatility and an RTP that is a bit “tight”, as it has been set at 94.02%.\n\nSlot graphics\nOn an aesthetic level, this slot features a decorative frame and golden reels, with sharp and functional graphics. It's like admiring a painting! Inside, we have the simplest and most beloved symbols, Fruit, Bells, lucky number 7s and double and triple BAR icons. The animation proposed for the flames is also very beautiful, ready to set your gaming experience on fire aboard this slot.\n\nGame features and special functionalities\nTo win in this slot, rely on the value of each combination that forms: for example, the Double BAR offers 10x your bet, while the triple BAR goes up to 15x. Then we have the Cherries, which pay up to 20x, the Golden Bell at 30x and the lucky number 7 that assigns you 50 times the original bet. Pay attention to the Wild multiplier though, as it's the only one that can make you dream big, paying up to 800x.\n\nIn addition to the value of the icons, however, there are no other additional functionalities. The game is therefore very basic, simple... just like the land-based slots that many gamblers have had the chance to try out in gaming halls. However, there are mini games and respins that can help you make the most of your winning spins.\n\nFinal considerations on Flamin’ 7s slot\nIf simplicity has always been your strength and you don't like new modern slots with many extra features and too many frills, you're in the right place! Thanks to Flamin’ 7s, you get in touch with the essence of slots, the ones formed by 3 reels, the essential and capable of paying out in cash and less in graphic effect. Among the \"old-school\" slots, it's one of the best we've had a chance to try, and it could certainly attract more experienced players. Its RTP is a bit limited, it must be recognized, as it's just below the average of the online gambling sector. But don't forget that if you're lucky, you can win over 1,400 times your total bet with this title!\n            ",

It should be noted that this is a title with medium volatility and an RTP that is a bit “tight”, as it has been set at 94.02%.\n\nSlot graphics\nOn an aesthetic level, this slot features a decorative frame and golden reels, with sharp and functional graphics. It's like admiring a painting! Inside, we have the simplest and most beloved symbols, Fruit, Bells, lucky number 7s and double and triple BAR icons. The animation proposed for the flames is also very beautiful, ready to set your gaming experience on fire aboard this slot.\n\nGame features and special functionalities\nTo win in this slot, rely on the value of each combination that forms: for example, the Double BAR offers 10x your bet, while the triple BAR goes up to 15x. Then we have the Cherries, which pay up to 20x, the Golden Bell at 30x and the lucky number 7 that assigns you 50 times the original bet. Pay attention to the Wild multiplier though, as it's the only one that can make you dream big, paying up to 800x.\n\nIn addition to the value of the icons, however, there are no other additional functionalities. The game is therefore very basic, simple... just like the land-based slots that many gamblers have had the chance to try out in gaming halls. However, there are mini games and respins that can help you make the most of your winning spins.\n\nFinal considerations on Flamin’ 7s slot\nIf simplicity has always been your strength and you don't like new modern slots with many extra features and too many frills, you're in the right place! Thanks to Flamin’ 7s, you get in touch with the essence of slots, the ones formed by 3 reels, the essential and capable of paying out in cash and less in graphic effect.

With Flamin’ 7s, PariPlay presents a classic theme for this game. The player is faced with 3 reels full of symbols and rewarding bonuses. Among these, there are stacked Wilds, respins and up to four mini games to try to increase winnings. Let's not forget about the sticky Jokers, which stick to the boxes and can also bring multipliers with them. It should be noted that this is a title with medium volatility and an RTP that is a bit “tight”, as it has been set at 94.02%.\n\nSlot graphics\nOn an aesthetic level, this slot features a decorative frame and golden reels, with sharp and functional graphics. It's like admiring a painting! Inside, we have the simplest and most beloved symbols, Fruit, Bells, lucky number 7s and double and triple BAR icons. The animation proposed for the flames is also very beautiful, ready to set your gaming experience on fire aboard this slot.\n\nGame features and special functionalities\nTo win in this slot, rely on the value of each combination that forms: for example, the Double BAR offers 10x your bet, while the triple BAR goes up to 15x. Then we have the Cherries, which pay up to 20x, the Golden Bell at 30x and the lucky number 7 that assigns you 50 times the original bet. Pay attention to the Wild multiplier though, as it's the only one that can make you dream big, paying up to 800x.\n\nIn addition to the value of the icons, however, there are no other additional functionalities. The game is therefore very basic, simple... just like the land-based slots that many gamblers have had the chance to try out in gaming halls. However, there are mini games and respins that can help you make the most of your winning spins.\n\nFinal considerations on Flamin’ 7s slot\nIf simplicity has always been your strength and you don't like new modern slots with many extra features and too many frills, you're in the right place! Thanks to Flamin’ 7s, you get in touch with the essence of slots, the ones formed by 3 reels, the essential and capable of paying out in cash and less in graphic effect. Among the \"old-school\" slots, it's one of the best we've had a chance to try, and it could certainly attract more experienced players. Its RTP is a bit limited, it must be recognized, as it's just below the average of the online gambling sector. But don't forget that if you're lucky, you can win over 1,400 times your total bet with this title!\n        ",
