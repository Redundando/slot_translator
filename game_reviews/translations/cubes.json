            "response": "Attention all experienced gamblers, allow me to present to you the slot game \"Cubes\". Have you ever attempted to solve the Rubik's Cube? For those of you who aren't familiar with it, it's an invention created by a Hungarian professor named Rubik back in 1974. The cube consists of six sides with different colors, each side divided into quadrants that can rotate thanks to an internal mechanism. To play, simply rotate the faces to mix up the quadrants and then attempt to restore the initial state - one face equals one color. \n\nThe graphics of Cubes are fairly minimalistic with a background consisting of a sea of gray cubes and the cube itself in the center. When you spin, all three-dimensional quadrants detach and rotate, ultimately landing with a different color. The game features some great animations that accompany winning combinations and big payouts. As for the music, it's a mix of electronic effects that can be turned off at any time.\n\nYou win by aligning 5 or more adjacent symbols anywhere on the grid. The base grid is 5x5, but every winning combination triggers an expansion of reels and rows. The first winning combination triggers a 7x7 grid, then a 9x9 and finally an 11x11 grid. Every expansion includes the addition of new colors that can generate new combinations. The grid returns to normal after each unsuccessful expansion and payouts are distributed after the final expansion. \n\nThe maximum prize is 3,000 times the bet, which starts at a minimum of €0.20 and a maximum of €100. You can activate automatic spins, turbo mode, access the paytable, and turn off the music in the settings. Cubes is of medium volatility, meaning the ratio between winning frequency and amount won is well-balanced. The RTP value is 96.35%.\n\nThere are five different colors, and you win with a minimum of 5 symbols, up to +25. The lower-value colors are blue, purple, and light blue, while red, yellow, and green pay the most. There are three special features:\n\n1. Central Multiplier: Each spin has a variable central multiplier of up to x22. If a cluster of the same color passes through the center, the entire payout is multiplied.\n\n2. Free Spins: To activate free spins, you need five groups of different colors on the grid. You will receive up to 10 free spins, and a random color will remain locked during the following spins. The grid size doesn't decrease in the bonus feature.\n\n3. Color Blast: If you obtain a group of 70 cubes of the same color during the Free Spins feature, you get a prize equal to 2,500 times the bet.\n\nOverall, Cubes by Hacksaw Gaming is a well-made slot game. Spins are smooth and don't cause any interruptions or glitches, even on older devices. For those who enjoy cluster games, Cubes is a great product that provides pleasant moments. The medium volatility seems like a good compromise, with decent winning frequency and potential payouts. The graphics may not be outstanding, but too many colors or animations would have been disruptive to the game's theme.\n\nFinally, for those who are wondering, Cubes is optimized for mobile devices, and there are no traditional paylines, only a cluster-win format in a 5x5 cube that can expand up to 11x11. Give Cubes 2 a try for an even more challenging experience!",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Cubes\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nCubes\n\nRaise your hand if you've ever tried to solve a Rubik's Cube at least once in your life. If you don't know what we're talking about, it's an invention that a Hungarian professor, Rubik, created in 1974. The six faces of the cube have different colors and are divided into squares that can rotate thanks to an internal mechanism. To play, you just need to turn the faces to mix up the squares and then try to restore the initial state, that is, one face = one color.\n\nCubes has a fairly minimalistic graphics, with a background made up of many cubes tending towards gray and in the center one of the faces of the cube. When you start the Spin, all the three-dimensional squares detach and rotate, landing with a different color. Some good animations follow the winning combinations and big wins. As for the musical component, the sounds are a mix of electronic effects that can be turned off at any time.\n\nSlot Features\n\nYou win by associating 5 or more adjacent symbols in any point of the grid. The basic grid is 5x5, although each win involves the expansion of reels and rows. A first winning combination determines a 7x7 grid, then 9x9 and finally 11x11. With each expansion, of course, new colors are added that can give rise to new combinations. The grid returns to normal after each non-winning addition. Wins are paid after the last expansion.\n\nThe maximum prize is 3,000 times the bet, which starts from a minimum of 0.20 € to a maximum of 100 €. From the settings, you can activate automatic spins, turbo function, open the pay table and turn off the music.\n\nCubes has a medium volatility, meaning that the ratio between win frequency and amounts won is well balanced. The RTP value is 96.35%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nWe have five different colors and win with a minimum of 5 symbols up to +25. The colors that are worth less are blue, purple, and light blue, while red, yellow, and green pay better.\n\nNow let's look at the three special functions:\n\nCentral Multiplier: Each Spin has a variable central multiplier up to a maximum of x22, which means that if a cluster of the same color passes through the center, the entire win will be multiplied.\n\nFree Spins: To get Free Spins, there must be five groups of different colors on the grid. In this case, you are rewarded with a maximum of 10 free spins and a random color is assigned that will remain locked during the following spins. In the bonus feature, the grid does not decrease in size.\n\nColor Blast: if you get a group of 70 cubes of the same color during Free Spins, then a prize equal to 2,500 times the bet is paid.\n\nOpinions on Cubes\n\nThe Hacksaw Gaming slot seemed really well done to us. The spins never caused sudden slowdowns or interruptions, despite the fairly dated pc we used. For those of us who love cluster games, Cubes can be a good product to spend enjoyable moments with. The medium volatility seems like a good compromise, you win with a good frequency and can receive significant amounts. The graphics are not excellent, but given the theme of the game, too many colors or animations would have just bothered us.\n\nFAQ\nCan I play Cubes on my mobile device?\n\nThis is exactly what the game has been optimized for! Hacksaw Gaming has created a series of slot games that are more suitable for playing on mobile devices. All you need is a stable internet connection and a compatible device.\n\nWhich features of the Cubes slot increase winnings?\n\nFocus on the Color Blast feature, which has been configured to increase your winnings and make very profitable combinations.\n\nHow many paylines are there in Cubes?\n\nThe game does not have traditional paylines; a cluster-win format has been developed in a 5x5 cube, which can increase up to 11x11. Also try Cubes 2 for even more \"brain-teasing\" matches!\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay and Features\nSpecial Features\nVolatility and RTP\nGraphics and Design\nMobile Optimization\nTarget Audience\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Cubes\n\nRaise your hand if you've ever tried to solve a Rubik's Cube at least once in your life. If you don't know what we're talking about, it's an invention that a Hungarian professor, Rubik, created in 1974. The six faces of the cube have different colors and are divided into squares that can rotate thanks to an internal mechanism. To play, you just need to turn the faces to mix up the squares and then try to restore the initial state, that is, one face = one color.\n\nCubes has a fairly minimalistic graphics, with a background made up of many cubes tending towards gray and in the center one of the faces of the cube. When you start the Spin, all the three-dimensional squares detach and rotate, landing with a different color. Some good animations follow the winning combinations and big wins. As for the musical component, the sounds are a mix of electronic effects that can be turned off at any time.\n\nSlot Features\n\nYou win by associating 5 or more adjacent symbols in any point of the grid. The basic grid is 5x5, although each win involves the expansion of reels and rows. A first winning combination determines a 7x7 grid, then 9x9 and finally 11x11. With each expansion, of course, new colors are added that can give rise to new combinations. The grid returns to normal after each non-winning addition. Wins are paid after the last expansion.\n\nThe maximum prize is 3,000 times the bet, which starts from a minimum of 0.20 € to a maximum of 100 €. From the settings, you can activate automatic spins, turbo function, open the pay table and turn off the music.\n\nCubes has a medium volatility, meaning that the ratio between win frequency and amounts won is well balanced. The RTP value is 96.35%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nWe have five different colors and win with a minimum of 5 symbols up to +25. The colors that are worth less are blue, purple, and light blue, while red, yellow, and green pay better.\n\nNow let's look at the three special functions:\n\nCentral Multiplier: Each Spin has a variable central multiplier up to a maximum of x22, which means that if a cluster of the same color passes through the center, the entire win will be multiplied.\n\nFree Spins: To get Free Spins, there must be five groups of different colors on the grid. In this case, you are rewarded with a maximum of 10 free spins and a random color is assigned that will remain locked during the following spins. In the bonus feature, the grid does not decrease in size.\n\nColor Blast: if you get a group of 70 cubes of the same color during Free Spins, then a prize equal to 2,500 times the bet is paid.\n\nOpinions on Cubes\n\nThe Hacksaw Gaming slot seemed really well done to us. The spins never caused sudden slowdowns or interruptions, despite the fairly dated pc we used. For those of us who love cluster games, Cubes can be a good product to spend enjoyable moments with. The medium volatility seems like a good compromise, you win with a good frequency and can receive significant amounts. The graphics are not excellent, but given the theme of the game, too many colors or animations would have just bothered us.\n\nFAQ\nCan I play Cubes on my mobile device?\n\nThis is exactly what the game has been optimized for! Hacksaw Gaming has created a series of slot games that are more suitable for playing on mobile devices. All you need is a stable internet connection and a compatible device.\n\nWhich features of the Cubes slot increase winnings?\n\nFocus on the Color Blast feature, which has been configured to increase your winnings and make very profitable combinations.\n\nHow many paylines are there in Cubes?\n\nThe game does not have traditional paylines; a cluster-win format has been developed in a 5x5 cube, which can increase up to 11x11. Also try Cubes 2 for even more \"brain-teasing\" matches!\n            ",

This leads to the expansion of the reels and rows up to 11x11, with each new expansion adding new colors that can result in new combinations. The game has a medium volatility, and the maximum payout is 3,000 times the bet, with a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum bet of €100. The game also features an auto-spin, turbo function, paytable, and sound control.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nCubes has three special features. The Central Multiplier feature provides a variable central multiplier up to a maximum of x22. If a cluster of the same color passes through the center, the entire win will be multiplied. The Free Spins feature is activated when there are five groups of different colors on the grid, and it awards a maximum of 10 free spins. A random color is assigned and remains locked during the next spins in this bonus feature, and the grid does not decrease in size. Lastly, the Color Blast feature pays a prize equal to 2,500 times the bet when players get a group of 70 cubes of the same color during Free Spins.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nCubes has a medium volatility, meaning that the balance between win frequency and amounts won is well-balanced. The RTP value is 96.35%, which is within the average range of online slot games.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nCubes' graphics are minimalistic, with a background made up of cubes leaning towards gray in color, and a single face of a Rubik's Cube in the center. During spins, all the cubes detach and rotate, landing with a new color, and there are good animations when winning combinations and big wins are achieved. The overall color scheme and design are suitable for the game's theme.\n\nMobile Optimization\n\nCubes has been optimized for mobile devices, making it easily accessible for players. As long as a player has a stable internet connection and a compatible device, they can play the game seamlessly.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nCubes is a game suited for players who enjoy cluster games and don't mind a medium volatility. The intriguing Rubik's Cube-inspired theme may attract those who appreciate minimalistic graphics, and the game may also appeal to players who play online slots on their mobile devices.\n\n        \n            ",

If you don't know what we're talking about, it's an invention that a Hungarian professor, Rubik, created in 1974. The six faces of the cube have different colors and are divided into squares that can rotate thanks to an internal mechanism. To play, you just need to turn the faces to mix up the squares and then try to restore the initial state, that is, one face = one color.\n\nCubes has a fairly minimalistic graphics, with a background made up of many cubes tending towards gray and in the center one of the faces of the cube. When you start the Spin, all the three-dimensional squares detach and rotate, landing with a different color. Some good animations follow the winning combinations and big wins. As for the musical component, the sounds are a mix of electronic effects that can be turned off at any time.\n\nSlot Features\n\nYou win by associating 5 or more adjacent symbols in any point of the grid. The basic grid is 5x5, although each win involves the expansion of reels and rows. A first winning combination determines a 7x7 grid, then 9x9 and finally 11x11. With each expansion, of course, new colors are added that can give rise to new combinations. The grid returns to normal after each non-winning addition. Wins are paid after the last expansion.\n\nThe maximum prize is 3,000 times the bet, which starts from a minimum of 0.20 € to a maximum of 100 €. From the settings, you can activate automatic spins, turbo function, open the pay table and turn off the music.\n\nCubes has a medium volatility, meaning that the ratio between win frequency and amounts won is well balanced. The RTP value is 96.35%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nWe have five different colors and win with a minimum of 5 symbols up to +25. The colors that are worth less are blue, purple, and light blue, while red, yellow, and green pay better.\n\nNow let's look at the three special functions:\n\nCentral Multiplier: Each Spin has a variable central multiplier up to a maximum of x22, which means that if a cluster of the same color passes through the center, the entire win will be multiplied.\n\nFree Spins: To get Free Spins, there must be five groups of different colors on the grid. In this case, you are rewarded with a maximum of 10 free spins and a random color is assigned that will remain locked during the following spins. In the bonus feature, the grid does not decrease in size.\n\nColor Blast: if you get a group of 70 cubes of the same color during Free Spins, then a prize equal to 2,500 times the bet is paid.\n\nOpinions on Cubes\n\nThe Hacksaw Gaming slot seemed really well done to us. The spins never caused sudden slowdowns or interruptions, despite the fairly dated pc we used. For those of us who love cluster games, Cubes can be a good product to spend enjoyable moments with. The medium volatility seems like a good compromise, you win with a good frequency and can receive significant amounts. The graphics are not excellent, but given the theme of the game, too many colors or animations would have just bothered us.\n\nFAQ\nCan I play Cubes on my mobile device?\n\nThis is exactly what the game has been optimized for! Hacksaw Gaming has created a series of slot games that are more suitable for playing on mobile devices. All you need is a stable internet connection and a compatible device.\n\nWhich features of the Cubes slot increase winnings?\n\nFocus on the Color Blast feature, which has been configured to increase your winnings and make very profitable combinations.\n\nHow many paylines are there in Cubes?\n\nThe game does not have traditional paylines; a cluster-win format has been developed in a 5x5 cube, which can increase up to 11x11. Also try Cubes 2 for even more \"brain-teasing\" matches!\n            ",

The basic grid is 5x5, although each win involves the expansion of reels and rows. A first winning combination determines a 7x7 grid, then 9x9 and finally 11x11. With each expansion, of course, new colors are added that can give rise to new combinations. The grid returns to normal after each non-winning addition. Wins are paid after the last expansion.\n\nThe maximum prize is 3,000 times the bet, which starts from a minimum of 0.20 € to a maximum of 100 €. From the settings, you can activate automatic spins, turbo function, open the pay table and turn off the music.\n\nCubes has a medium volatility, meaning that the ratio between win frequency and amounts won is well balanced. The RTP value is 96.35%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nWe have five different colors and win with a minimum of 5 symbols up to +25. The colors that are worth less are blue, purple, and light blue, while red, yellow, and green pay better.\n\nNow let's look at the three special functions:\n\nCentral Multiplier: Each Spin has a variable central multiplier up to a maximum of x22, which means that if a cluster of the same color passes through the center, the entire win will be multiplied.\n\nFree Spins: To get Free Spins, there must be five groups of different colors on the grid. In this case, you are rewarded with a maximum of 10 free spins and a random color is assigned that will remain locked during the following spins. In the bonus feature, the grid does not decrease in size.\n\nColor Blast: if you get a group of 70 cubes of the same color during Free Spins, then a prize equal to 2,500 times the bet is paid.\n\nOpinions on Cubes\n\nThe Hacksaw Gaming slot seemed really well done to us. The spins never caused sudden slowdowns or interruptions, despite the fairly dated pc we used. For those of us who love cluster games, Cubes can be a good product to spend enjoyable moments with. The medium volatility seems like a good compromise, you win with a good frequency and can receive significant amounts. The graphics are not excellent, but given the theme of the game, too many colors or animations would have just bothered us.\n\nFAQ\nCan I play Cubes on my mobile device?\n\nThis is exactly what the game has been optimized for! Hacksaw Gaming has created a series of slot games that are more suitable for playing on mobile devices. All you need is a stable internet connection and a compatible device.\n\nWhich features of the Cubes slot increase winnings?\n\nFocus on the Color Blast feature, which has been configured to increase your winnings and make very profitable combinations.\n\nHow many paylines are there in Cubes?\n\nThe game does not have traditional paylines; a cluster-win format has been developed in a 5x5 cube, which can increase up to 11x11. Also try Cubes 2 for even more \"brain-teasing\" matches!\n        ",
