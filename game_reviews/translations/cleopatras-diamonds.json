Cleopatra's Diamonds is an online slot game developed by Swintt that revolves around the fascinating and mysterious theme of Ancient Egypt. The lavish graphics, medium volatility and 96.01% RTP complete this little gem, which is rich in unique bonus features.\n\nGameplay Overview\nCleopatra's Diamonds is the game developed by the renowned studio Swintt. Released in October 2022, this online slot is based on a 5x3 grid with 20 paylines that intersect from left to right. The maximum win is 5000x the bet.\n\nThe minimum bet starts from 0.20 up to a maximum of 10 credits with the ability to activate the AutoPlay function up to 50 times. The win is determined when three or more matching symbols land on a payline.\n\nSymbols in Cleopatra's Diamonds Slot\nIn this sparkling no-download slot, a set of 9 symbols spin on the reels, consisting of 5 low-value icons that correspond to classic card suits + 4 high-value icons represented by jewel beetles and ships, jeweled leopards and of course the iconic Queen Cleopatra.\n\nThe key symbol of the game is the Golden Book, which functions as both Wild and Scatter. This means that it can not only replace other symbols in winning combinations, but also activate the Free Spins feature.\n\nHow to Activate Special Features\n\nFree Spins\nYou can get 10 free spins if 3 or more scatter symbols appear on the game screen. The Golden Book will appear in an expanded form and your task will be to press START and wait for the pages to start spinning to reveal the lucky expanding symbol.\n\nGamble Feature\nAfter every win, you can participate in the Gamble Feature and bet it all to try and boost your winnings.\n\nWarp Boost\nYour chances of hitting a big win will be significantly higher during this random feature. It can be activated both during base spins and free spins.\n\nBuy Feature\nCan't wait for the required number of scatters to hit during your rounds? Well, worry no more. Thanks to the Buy Feature, you can spin the reels for free whenever you want.\n\nMy Final Thoughts\nOverall, Cleopatra's Diamonds doesn't seem to stand out remarkably compared to other online slots with an Ancient Egypt theme, even though the Swintt software house demonstrates that it has what it takes to create high-quality games. The graphics and some interesting special features make the rounds fun and never banal, and the 5,000x jackpot is definitely worth the game, making it an excellent choice for players who prefer low bets.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAre there free spins in Cleopatra's Diamonds?\n\nSure thing. If you find more than 3 symbols of the Golden Book at once, you will receive a set of 10 free spins to try and hit the lucky winning combinations.\n\nAre there special gameplay features in this Ancient Egypt-themed slot game by Swintt?\n\nYes, there is the Warp Boost random mode that increases your chances of winning, and you can also take advantage of the Gamble Feature and Buy Feature Games option.\n\nCan I play Cleopatra's Diamonds for free?\n\nYes, of course! To check it out without risking anything, simply click on the free slot link and select the demo game you prefer.\n            ",
