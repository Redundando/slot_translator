The player can bet on each line a number of coins ranging from one to 10, with a value ranging from a minimum of 1 cent to a maximum of €0.50 to bet on all five lines. Its RTP of 96.5% and high volatility make it competitive in terms of winnings.\n\nWinning Symbols\n\nJoker's Jewels features gemstones on its reels, along with thematically specific icons related to the symbol of the Joker. The paytable displays the value of each symbol. The mask of the Joker pays the most with a win equal to €50 for an alignment of five symbols, while the round dark blue gem pays the lowest with a maximum of €1.\n\nBonus Features\n\nJoker's Jewels offers a bonus game triggered by the Scatter symbol, represented by a red crown with the word Bonus.

One such example is Joker Gems, which is very similar in terms of graphics and gameplay. For those looking for a more complex game but still on the same theme, Novomatic's Mega Joker is a high-adrenaline game that is perfect for the most daring players.\n\nReturn to Player Rate\n\nJoker's Jewels has an RTP of 96.5%, which means that the game returns an average of €96.5 to players for every €100 wagered. While this is not the highest RTP rate in the market, it's still a competitive rate that offers players a good chance of winning in the long run.\n\n        \n            ",

The paytable is displayed at the top of the screen and shows the value of each symbol. The game has five paylines, and players can bet on each line with one to 10 coins, with a value ranging from a minimum of 1 cent to a maximum of €0.50.\n\nBonus Features\n\nJoker's Jewels has a bonus game that is activated by the Scatter symbol, a red crown with the word Bonus. The bonus game is not very complex, but it offers multipliers that are activated on the highest win, allowing players to potentially win big. The game has no other major bonus features.\n\nSimilar Slots\n\nThe Joker is a popular theme in the world of online slots, and there are many games that incorporate this character. A similar game to Joker's Jewels is Joker Gems, which features a vintage graphics style, gemstones, and symbols related to the Joker. Another game, Mega Joker by Novomatic, is more complex but still incorporates the same theme. It offers higher adrenaline and a 'Double or Nothing' function that allows players to risk everything on each win.\n\nReturn to Player Rate\n\nJoker's Jewels has an RTP rate of 96.5%, which is competitive in terms of winning potential. The game's high volatility means that players may experience some periods of low wins, but also offers the chance for big payouts if luck is in their favor.\n\n        \n            ",

This type of slot machine, to which Joker Jewels fully belongs, does not have showiness or complexity among its strong points, but rather simplicity is the most appreciated feature.\nTherefore, linear graphics and very intuitive gameplay for a slot that, with a return to player (RTP) of 96.5% and a decidedly high volatility, is competitive in terms of winnings.\nThe player can bet on each line a number of coins ranging from one to 10, with a value ranging from a minimum of 1 cent to a maximum of €0.50, for a bet of up to €25 on all five lines.\nRegular and special symbols of Joker Jewels\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels are represented by gemstones to which thematically specific icons referring to the figure of the Joker are added.\nIn this slot machine, the numbers and letters of playing cards, which we find in practically all other games of this developer, are not present.\nAt the top of the main screen is the paytable, which can be consulted to discover the value of each symbol: the mask of the Joker is the one that pays the most, with a win equal to €50 for an alignment of five symbols, while the one with the lowest value is represented by the round dark blue gem, which pays a maximum of €1.\nBonus game\nDespite the gameplay reduced to essentials, Joker Jewels offers a bonus game, activate thanks to the Scatter, in this case a red crown with the word Bonus. \nIt is not a particularly complex bonus game, but it provides multipliers that are activated on the highest win, allowing the player to obtain even substantial winnings.\nSlots similar to Joker Jewels\nThe figure of the Joker is famous in the world of slot machines and there are several software houses that propose it in their games.\nVery similar to Joker Jewels both in terms of graphics and gameplay is Joker Gems: here too, gemstones and symbols related to the figure of the Joker alternate on the reels, in a simple and intuitive vintage game.\nIf you are looking for something more complex but still on the same theme, we suggest Mega Joker by Novomatic, a high-adrenaline game suitable for the most daring players: you can bet from a minimum of €0.20 up to a maximum of €100 per spin, for a total of 10 spins per session and it is also possible to risk everything on each win with the \"Double or Nothing\" function.\n        ",
