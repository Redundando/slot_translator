And it's precisely in this slot machine signed by Evoplay that the so-called Villains make the difference. Forgotten Fable is a fantasy-themed slot, built starting from a classic structure of 5x3 reels with 15 paylines. It's one of the online machines that boasts some of the most beautiful graphics ever seen, capable of proposing an innovative style that is definitely the strong point of this software house. There are also some new special features that we'll discover in this review, such as Magic Chests with multipliers and free spins. So let's see the features of this slot with an RTP of 96% and medium volatility.\n\nCharacteristics and graphics of the slot\n\nThe graphics are impeccable, the villains are specially created by the provider, who brings us to meet Baba Yaga, Koschei the Immortal, Vodyanoy, Leshy and Gorynych, which are the Legends ready to pay the most. They are flanked by other symbols that alternate on the reels turn after turn: we're talking about Serpents with dragon-like appearances and Royals. But what unlocks the gameplay from its base game are two special wild symbols: Skull and Sun. Both can replace any other game icon and respectively activate dark runes and flame runes. They can thus attribute free spins and allow the player to receive more and more interesting winnings. As a whole, it's possible to get a potential win of up to 1,270 times the bet when in the base game.\n\nSpecial features\n\nThe golden egg is the wild that can contribute to always create new combinations by replacing any missing piece on the game grid. However, we must remember that it has no power in front of the Skull or Sun icons. It's important to say that when a winning spin is obtained, an animation starts both for the Skull and for the Sun, leading to the appearance of a magic chest that can bring up to 5 multipliers. Their value is between 2x and 6x. Thus generated winnings can undergo an interesting boost and increase the amount received.\n\nAs for Free Spins, a feature that puts 10 in play are planned, and multipliers can rise from 4x to 12x. In the case of Flameland spins, there are no multipliers, but combinations have a higher base value.\n\nFinal considerations on Forgotten Fable slot\n\nIt's hard to find any negative notes on Forgotten Fable. The provider continues to show great care and attention in creating its slots, starting from an excellent graphics, which is accompanied by a great gameplay. Its program of extra functionalities and rewards offered to players is also noteworthy. The theme might not appeal to everyone, but it's worth trying because it's unlikely to disappoint the expectations of each player. Are you ready to venture into the world of Forgotten Fable?",

And it is precisely in this slot machine signed by Evoplay that the so-called Villains make the difference. Forgotten Fable is a fantasy-themed slot, built starting from a classic structure of 5x3 reels with 15 paylines. It is one of the online machines that boasts some of the most beautiful graphics ever seen, capable of proposing an innovative style that is certainly the strength of this software house. There are also some new special features that we will discover in this review, such as Magic Chests with multipliers and free spins. Let's see the characteristics of this slot with an RTP at 96% and medium volatility.\n\nSlot features and graphics\nThe graphics are impeccable, the villains are custom-made by the provider who introduces us to Baba Yaga, Koschei the Immortal, Vodyanoy, Leshy and Gorynych, which are the Legends ready to pay the most. They are accompanied by other symbols that alternate on the reels spin after spin: we are talking about the Serpents with the appearance of dragons and the Royals. But to unlock the gameplay from its base game, there are two special Wild symbols: the Skull and the Sun. Both can replace any other game icon and respectively activate the dark runes and the flame runes. They can thus attribute free spins and allow the player to receive increasingly interesting winnings. Overall, it is possible to obtain a potential win of up to 1,270 times the bet when in the base game.\n\nSpecial features\nThe golden egg is the Wild that can contribute to always creating new combinations by replacing any missing piece on the game grid. However, it has no power over the Skull or Sun icons. It is important to say that when a winning spin is obtained, an animation starts for both the Skull and the Sun, leading to the appearance of a magic chest that will bring up to 5 multipliers. Their value ranges between 2x and 6x. The generated winnings can thus receive an interesting boost and increase the amount received.\n\nAs for the Free Spins, a feature that offers 10 free spins is in play, and the multipliers can go from 4x to 12x. In the case of Flameland spins, on the other hand, there are no multipliers, but the combinations have a higher base value.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Forgotten Fable slot\nIt is hard to find negative notes on Forgotten Fable. The provider continues to show great care and attention in the creation of its slots, starting from excellent graphics, which are accompanied by excellent gameplay. Also noteworthy is its program of extra features and rewards offered to players. The theme may not appeal to everyone, but it is worth trying because it rarely disappoints the expectations of each individual player. As an experienced gambler, you will surely appreciate the special features included in the game and the potential winnings that they can bring.\n            ",

And it is precisely in this slot machine signed by Evoplay that the so-called Villains make the difference. Forgotten Fable is a fantasy-themed slot, built starting from a classic structure of 5x3 reels with 15 paylines. It is one of the online machines that boasts some of the most beautiful graphics ever seen, capable of proposing an innovative style that is certainly the strength of this software house. There are also some new special features that we will discover in this review, such as Magic Chests with multipliers and free spins. Let's see the characteristics of this slot with an RTP at 96% and medium volatility.\n\nSlot features and graphics\nThe graphics are impeccable, the villains are custom-made by the provider who introduces us to Baba Yaga, Koschei the Immortal, Vodyanoy, Leshy and Gorynych, which are the Legends ready to pay the most. They are accompanied by other symbols that alternate on the reels spin after spin: we are talking about the Serpents with the appearance of dragons and the Royals. But to unlock the gameplay from its base game, there are two special Wild symbols: the Skull and the Sun. Both can replace any other game icon and respectively activate the dark runes and the flame runes. They can thus attribute free spins and allow the player to receive increasingly interesting winnings. Overall, it is possible to obtain a potential win of up to 1,270 times the bet when in the base game.\n\nSpecial features\nThe golden egg is the Wild that can contribute to always creating new combinations by replacing any missing piece on the game grid. However, it has no power over the Skull or Sun icons. It is important to say that when a winning spin is obtained, an animation starts for both the Skull and the Sun, leading to the appearance of a magic chest that will bring up to 5 multipliers. Their value ranges between 2x and 6x. The generated winnings can thus receive an interesting boost and increase the amount received.\n\nAs for the Free Spins, a feature that offers 10 free spins is in play, and the multipliers can go from 4x to 12x. In the case of Flameland spins, on the other hand, there are no multipliers, but the combinations have a higher base value.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Forgotten Fable slot\nIt is hard to find negative notes on Forgotten Fable. The provider continues to show great care and attention in the creation of its slots, starting from excellent graphics, which are accompanied by excellent gameplay. Also noteworthy is its program of extra features and rewards offered to players. The theme may not appeal to everyone, but it is worth trying because it rarely disappoints the expectations of each individual player. As an experienced gambler, you will surely appreciate the special features included in the game and the potential winnings that they can bring.\n        ",
