    "original_text": "\nJellyfish Flow\nJellyfish Flow sembra essere un progetto speciale per Habanero, come una slot machine dove entrambi stanno provando alcune nuove meccaniche divertenti, e un nuovo tipo di opzione di volatilità, che gli permette di pagare grandi vincite. È anche un gioco carino, con i suoi simboli di meduse che galleggiano in giro, e con il fondo dell’oceano come sfondo.\nSi inizia con bobine 3×3 e 27 modi per vincere, ma man mano che l’area di gioco si espande fino a 7×7 bobine, si potrebbe finire con un impressionante 823.543 modi. Il potenziale del gioco è quello di pagare molto, fino a 32.416x la posta in gioco, ma questa è solo l’opzione base. Accendi l’impostazione Ultra, e la volatilità diventa molto alta, mentre le ricompense ottengono un enorme aumento, fino a 168.004x la puntata. Sicuramente non è un gioco per tutti, ma i veterani probabilmente lo apprezzeranno. Come caratteristiche, si basa su espansioni wilds e reel, quindi la lista non è molto lunga.\nUna grafica da fondali marini\nÈ una bellissimo slot a tema oceanico e meduse, che ci porta il solito design di alta gamma di Habanero. Lo sviluppatore è noto per l’eccellente grafica dei suoi giochi, e altri dello stesso si possono trovare qui. Jellyfish Flow offre inizialmente 3 piccole bobine, che vengono coperte da alcuni tipi diversi di simboli. Oltre alle meduse selvatiche multicolori, le altre includono una medusa blu, verde, rossa e gialla.\nIl design del gioco è superbo per una slot di livello medio come questa. Non siamo riusciti a trovare nessun difetto serio, quindi per le nostre aspettative il gioco soddisfa le condizioni per un’esperienza di gioco.\nIl tema è l’oceano, cioè il fondo dell’oceano, dove un certo numero di sirene si muovono tra cavallucci marini, granchi, tartarughe, polpi e così via. C’è un allegro tema musicale con il gameplay che afferma che gli sviluppatori hanno fatto un serio tentativo di fornire una slot divertente.\nJellyfish Flow è un gioco impressionante per diversi motivi, ma prima di tutto è il potenziale di payout e l’enorme volatilità della modalità Ultra che attirerà la vostra attenzione. Non consiglierei a nessuno di giocare regolarmente in modalità Ultra, dato che la versione regolare del gioco è già abbastanza volatile, e i payout sono superiori alla media anche lì. Vale la pena di controllare però, e io per primo l’ho trovata un’interessante aggiunta alla categoria dell’alta volatilità.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nUtilizzerai 15 monete, e inizierai le tue scommesse da un minimo di 0,15 euro a giro. Il limite superiore tende ad essere abbastanza alto nelle slot Habanero, anche se non mi aspetterei lo stesso qui, dato che questo ha una volatilità così alta e rendimenti enormi.\nIl potenziale del gioco varia a seconda che si giochi in modalità regolare o Ultra. La versione regolare di Jellyfish Flow è già considerata un’opzione ad altissima volatilità, ed è in grado di pagare eccellenti ricompense fino a 32.416x la puntata. Il suo RTP è probabilmente al 96,69%, ma come gioco con le gamme RTP, i casinò online di Habanero possono andare più in basso o più in alto.\nE poi, c’è la modalità Ultra. In questa versione della slot machine, si può essere pagati fino a 168.004x la puntata, una delle più grandi vincite che saranno mai disponibili in un gioco regolare. La volatilità ottiene un forte aumento, fino a raggiungere l’Ultra High. Apparentemente, la volatilità è 9 volte superiore a quella della versione regolare (che è molto alta), ma se le vincite arrivano a vostro favore, ci sono maggiori possibilità che cambino vita. RTP dovrebbe essere del 96,70%, ma ancora una volta, le versioni inferiori o superiori sono possibili nei casinò, dipende tutto da loro.\nIl modo in cui il gioco vi darà combinazioni vincenti, è attraverso simboli corrispondenti che appaiono su rulli consecutivi. Per ottenere una vincita sono necessarie tre icone corrispondenti su altrettante bobine. Si inizia con 27 modi per vincere, in un’area di gioco con 3×3 rulli.\nLa grande caratteristica di questo gioco si basa sull’espansione delle bobine. Per fare questo, avrete bisogno dell’atterraggio di Jellyfish Wild sui rulli. Ognuno di questi simboli espande l’area di gioco, ma diventa anche appiccicoso e continua a muoversi verso l’alto di una posizione, per ogni round. Alla fine, è possibile raggiungere un’area di gioco di bobine fino a 7×7, ma non è certo una cosa facile da fare.\nI Jellyfish Wilds possono essere usati come sostituti, quindi vi aiuteranno anche a formare combinazioni più vincenti mentre sono in giro.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nScoprite quali premi possono essere nascosti sul fondo del mare quando giocate alla slot Maidens of the Sea di Endemol. Questa slot a 40 linee di pagamento ha quattro file e cinque rulli che possono offrire una vincita massima di 200.000x. Il gioco ha anche due modificatori di bobine che possono sostituire i simboli e creare dei wilds sulle bobine, così come un bonus di giri gratis. Il RTP teorico è del 96,30%.\nLe sirene sono reali ed esistono nel loro queendom subacqueo nella slot Maidens of the Sea. Il gioco è dotato di tre caratteristiche che possono aumentare le potenziali vincite o fornire un bonus di giri gratis. Gli esperti di slot della società Endemol che sono dietro questo gioco, hanno realizzato un reel-set di cinque rulli e quattro file che girano su 40 linee di pagamento sempre attive.\n",

It's also a cute game, with its jellyfish symbols floating around, and the ocean floor as the background.\n\nYou start with 3x3 reels and 27 ways to win, but as the playing area expands up to 7x7 reels, you could end up with an impressive 823,543 ways to win. The game's potential is to pay out a lot, up to 32,416x the bet, but that's only the base option. Turn on the Ultra setting, and volatility becomes very high, while rewards get a huge boost, up to 168,004x the bet. It's definitely not a game for everyone, but veterans will probably appreciate it. As for features, it's based on wild expansion and reel expansion, so the list is not very long.\n\nIt's a beautiful ocean and jellyfish-themed slot, with Habanero's usual high-end design. The developer is known for its excellent graphics in its games, and others can be found here. Jellyfish Flow initially offers 3 small reels, which are covered with several different types of symbols. In addition to the multicolored wild jellyfish, the others include a blue, green, red, and yellow jellyfish.\n\nThe game design is superb for a mid-level slot like this. We couldn't find any serious flaws, so for our expectations, the game meets the conditions for a gaming experience.\n\nThe theme is the ocean, i.e., the ocean floor, where a number of mermaids move among seahorses, crabs, turtles, octopuses, and so on. There's a cheerful musical theme with gameplay that claims the developers have made a serious attempt to provide a fun slot.\n\nJellyfish Flow is an impressive game for several reasons, but first and foremost is the potential payout and huge volatility of the Ultra mode that will catch your attention. I wouldn't recommend anyone play regularly in Ultra mode, since the regular version of the game is already volatile enough, and payouts are above average even there. It's worth checking out, though, and I found it to be an interesting addition to the high volatility category.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nYou'll use 15 coins and start your bets from a minimum of 0.15 euros per spin. The upper limit tends to be quite high in Habanero slots, although I wouldn't expect the same here, given its high volatility and enormous returns.\n\nThe game's potential varies depending on whether you play in regular or Ultra mode. The regular version of Jellyfish Flow is already considered a very high volatility option and can pay out excellent rewards up to 32,416x the bet. Its RTP is probably around 96.69%, but as an RTP-range game, Habanero online casinos can go lower or higher.\n\nAnd then, there's the Ultra mode. In this version of the slot machine, you can be paid up to 168,004x your bet, one of the biggest wins that will ever be available in a regular game. Volatility gets a strong boost, reaching Ultra High. Apparently, volatility is 9 times higher than the regular version (which is already very high), but if wins come in your favor, there's a greater chance they'll change your life. RTP should be 96.70%, but again, lower or higher versions are possible in casinos, it all depends on them.\n\nThe way the game will give you winning combinations is through matching symbols that appear on consecutive reels. To get a win, you need three matching icons on as many reels. You start with 27 ways to win in a playing area with 3x3 reels.\n\nThe great feature of this game is based on reel expansion. To do this, you'll need to land Jellyfish Wilds on the reels. Each of these symbols expands the playing area, but also becomes sticky and continues to move up one position, for each round. Eventually, you can reach a playing area of reels up to 7x7, but it's certainly not an easy thing to do.\n\nJellyfish Wilds can be used as replacements, so they'll also help you form more winning combinations while they're around.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nDiscover what prizes may be hidden on the sea floor when you play the slot Maidens of the Sea by Endemol. This 40-payline slot has four rows and five reels that can offer a maximum win of 200,000x. The game also has two reel modifiers that can replace symbols and create wilds on the reels, as well as a free spins bonus. The theoretical RTP is 96.30%.\n\nThe mermaids are real and exist in their underwater queendom in the slot Maidens of the Sea. The game features three features that can increase potential wins or provide a free spins bonus.

La volatilità ottiene un forte aumento, fino a raggiungere l’Ultra High. Apparentemente, la volatilità è 9 volte superiore a quella della versione regolare (che è molto alta), ma se le vincite arrivano a vostro favore, ci sono maggiori possibilità che cambino vita. RTP dovrebbe essere del 96,70%, ma ancora una volta, le versioni inferiori o superiori sono possibili nei casinò, dipende tutto da loro.\nIl modo in cui il gioco vi darà combinazioni vincenti, è attraverso simboli corrispondenti che appaiono su rulli consecutivi. Per ottenere una vincita sono necessarie tre icone corrispondenti su altrettante bobine. Si inizia con 27 modi per vincere, in un’area di gioco con 3×3 rulli.\nLa grande caratteristica di questo gioco si basa sull’espansione delle bobine. Per fare questo, avrete bisogno dell’atterraggio di Jellyfish Wild sui rulli. Ognuno di questi simboli espande l’area di gioco, ma diventa anche appiccicoso e continua a muoversi verso l’alto di una posizione, per ogni round. Alla fine, è possibile raggiungere un’area di gioco di bobine fino a 7×7, ma non è certo una cosa facile da fare.\nI Jellyfish Wilds possono essere usati come sostituti, quindi vi aiuteranno anche a formare combinazioni più vincenti mentre sono in giro.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nScoprite quali premi possono essere nascosti sul fondo del mare quando giocate alla slot Maidens of the Sea di Endemol. Questa slot a 40 linee di pagamento ha quattro file e cinque rulli che possono offrire una vincita massima di 200.000x. Il gioco ha anche due modificatori di bobine che possono sostituire i simboli e creare dei wilds sulle bobine, così come un bonus di giri gratis. Il RTP teorico è del 96,30%.\nLe sirene sono reali ed esistono nel loro queendom subacqueo nella slot Maidens of the Sea. Il gioco è dotato di tre caratteristiche che possono aumentare le potenziali vincite o fornire un bonus di giri gratis. Gli esperti di slot della società Endemol che sono dietro questo gioco, hanno realizzato un reel-set di cinque rulli e quattro file che girano su 40 linee di pagamento sempre attive.\n\n        ",

It's also a cute game, with its floating jellyfish symbols and the ocean floor as its background. \n\nStarting with 3x3 reels and 27 ways to win, the game expands up to 7x7 reels, potentially reaching an impressive 823,543 ways to win. The game's potential is to pay a lot, up to 32,416x the stake, but that's just the base option. Turn on the Ultra setting, and the volatility becomes very high, while the rewards get an enormous increase, up to 168,004x the bet. Definitely not a game for everyone, but veterans are likely to appreciate it. As for features, it's based on wild and reel expansions, so the list isn't very long.\n\nThe graphics of Jellyfish Flow are beautiful, featuring an oceanic and jellyfish theme that showcases Habanero's high-end design. The developer is known for its excellent graphics in its games, which can also be found here. Jellyfish Flow initially offers 3 small reels, which are covered by various types of symbols. Alongside the multicolored wild jellyfish, there are also blue, green, red, and yellow jellyfish symbols.\n\nThe game's design is superb for a mid-level slot like this. We couldn't find any serious flaws, so for our expectations, the game satisfies the conditions for a gaming experience. The theme is the ocean, aka the ocean floor, where a number of mermaids move among seahorses, crabs, turtles, octopuses, and so on. There is a cheerful musical theme with gameplay that states the developers have made a serious attempt to provide a fun slot experience.\n\nJellyfish Flow is an impressive game for several reasons, but first and foremost is the potential payout and the enormous volatility of the Ultra mode that will draw your attention. I wouldn't recommend playing regularly in Ultra mode, as the regular version of the game is already quite volatile, and the payouts are above average there too. It's worth checking out, though, and I found it to be an interesting addition to the high-volatility category.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nYou will use 15 coins and start your bets from a minimum of 0.15 euros per spin. The upper limit tends to be quite high in Habanero slots, although I wouldn't expect the same here, as the game has such high volatility and enormous returns.\n\nThe game's potential varies depending on whether you play in regular or Ultra mode. The regular version of Jellyfish Flow is already considered an option with very high volatility and is capable of paying up to 32,416x the stake. Its RTP is probably around 96.69%, but as with RTP range games, online casinos can go lower or higher.\n\nAnd then, there is the Ultra mode. In this version of the slot machine, you can be paid up to 168,004x the stake, one of the biggest payouts that will ever be available in a regular game. Volatility gets a strong increase, up to Ultra High. Apparently, the volatility is 9 times higher than that of the regular version (which is already very high), but if the wins come in your favor, there are greater chances of changing your life. The RTP is supposed to be 96.70%, but again, lower or higher versions are possible in casinos, it all depends on them.\n\nThe way the game will give you winning combinations is through matching symbols that appear on consecutive reels. To get a win, three matching icons are required on as many reels. You start with 27 ways to win in a game area with 3x3 reels.\n\nThe great feature of this game is based on reel expansions. To do this, you'll need the Jellyfish Wild to land on the reels. Each of these symbols expands the game area but also becomes sticky and moves up one position for each round. Eventually, you can reach a game area of reels up to 7x7, but it's not an easy thing to do.\n\nJellyfish Wilds can be used as substitutes, so they will also help you form more winning combinations while they're around.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nDiscover what prizes may be hidden on the ocean floor when you play Endemol's Maidens of the Sea slot machine. This 40-payline slot has four rows and five reels that can offer a maximum win of 200,000x. The game also has two reel modifiers that can replace symbols and create wilds on reels, as well as a free spins bonus. The theoretical RTP is 96.30%.\n\nMermaids are real and exist in their underwater queendom in the Maidens of the Sea slot. The game features three features that can increase potential payouts or provide a free spins bonus. The slot experts of the company Endemol who are behind this game have created a reel-set of five reels and four rows that spin on 40 always active paylines."

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame mechanics and features\nVolatility option\nGraphics and theme\nPotential payout\nReel expansions and wilds\nTarget audience\nSimilar slot games\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Jellyfish Flow appears to be a special project for Habanero, like a slot machine where they are both trying out some new fun mechanics and a new type of volatility option that allows for big payouts. It's also a cute game, with its floating jellyfish symbols and the ocean floor as its background. \n\nStarting with 3x3 reels and 27 ways to win, the game expands up to 7x7 reels, potentially reaching an impressive 823,543 ways to win. The game's potential is to pay a lot, up to 32,416x the stake, but that's just the base option. Turn on the Ultra setting, and the volatility becomes very high, while the rewards get an enormous increase, up to 168,004x the bet. Definitely not a game for everyone, but veterans are likely to appreciate it. As for features, it's based on wild and reel expansions, so the list isn't very long.\n\nThe graphics of Jellyfish Flow are beautiful, featuring an oceanic and jellyfish theme that showcases Habanero's high-end design. The developer is known for its excellent graphics in its games, which can also be found here. Jellyfish Flow initially offers 3 small reels, which are covered by various types of symbols. Alongside the multicolored wild jellyfish, there are also blue, green, red, and yellow jellyfish symbols.\n\nThe game's design is superb for a mid-level slot like this. We couldn't find any serious flaws, so for our expectations, the game satisfies the conditions for a gaming experience. The theme is the ocean, aka the ocean floor, where a number of mermaids move among seahorses, crabs, turtles, octopuses, and so on. There is a cheerful musical theme with gameplay that states the developers have made a serious attempt to provide a fun slot experience.\n\nJellyfish Flow is an impressive game for several reasons, but first and foremost is the potential payout and the enormous volatility of the Ultra mode that will draw your attention. I wouldn't recommend playing regularly in Ultra mode, as the regular version of the game is already quite volatile, and the payouts are above average there too. It's worth checking out, though, and I found it to be an interesting addition to the high-volatility category.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nYou will use 15 coins and start your bets from a minimum of 0.15 euros per spin. The upper limit tends to be quite high in Habanero slots, although I wouldn't expect the same here, as the game has such high volatility and enormous returns.\n\nThe game's potential varies depending on whether you play in regular or Ultra mode. The regular version of Jellyfish Flow is already considered an option with very high volatility and is capable of paying up to 32,416x the stake. Its RTP is probably around 96.69%, but as with RTP range games, online casinos can go lower or higher.\n\nAnd then, there is the Ultra mode. In this version of the slot machine, you can be paid up to 168,004x the stake, one of the biggest payouts that will ever be available in a regular game. Volatility gets a strong increase, up to Ultra High. Apparently, the volatility is 9 times higher than that of the regular version (which is already very high), but if the wins come in your favor, there are greater chances of changing your life. The RTP is supposed to be 96.70%, but again, lower or higher versions are possible in casinos, it all depends on them.\n\nThe way the game will give you winning combinations is through matching symbols that appear on consecutive reels. To get a win, three matching icons are required on as many reels. You start with 27 ways to win in a game area with 3x3 reels.\n\nThe great feature of this game is based on reel expansions. To do this, you'll need the Jellyfish Wild to land on the reels. Each of these symbols expands the game area but also becomes sticky and moves up one position for each round. Eventually, you can reach a game area of reels up to 7x7, but it's not an easy thing to do.\n\nJellyfish Wilds can be used as substitutes, so they will also help you form more winning combinations while they're around.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nDiscover what prizes may be hidden on the ocean floor when you play Endemol's Maidens of the Sea slot machine. This 40-payline slot has four rows and five reels that can offer a maximum win of 200,000x. The game also has two reel modifiers that can replace symbols and create wilds on reels, as well as a free spins bonus. The theoretical RTP is 96.30%.\n\nMermaids are real and exist in their underwater queendom in the Maidens of the Sea slot. The game features three features that can increase potential payouts or provide a free spins bonus. The slot experts of the company Endemol who are behind this game have created a reel-set of five reels and four rows that spin on 40 always active paylines.\n            ",

(4 bullet points)\n- Bullet lists briefly covering the topic \"What we don't like\". (2 bullet pints)\n- SEO optimized meta title with a maximum length of 45 characters. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a length of 15 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame mechanics and features\n\nJellyfish Flow starts with 3x3 reels and 27 ways to win, but it can expand up to 7x7 reels, potentially reaching up to 823,543 ways to win. It's based on wild and reel expansions, so the list of features isn't very long. To get a win, three matching icons are required on as many reels. Jellyfish Wilds can be used as substitutes, make more winning combinations while they're around, and also expand the game area.\n\nVolatility option\n\nThe game has two different volatility modes. The regular version of Jellyfish Flow is already an option with very high volatility and can pay up to 32,416x the stake. The RTP in that case is approximately 96.69%, subject to variation depending on the online casino. The Ultra mode provides an enormous increase in rewards, with the potential of paying up to 168,004x the bet. Volatility is also much higher and about 9 times greater than in the regular version. The RTP in this mode is supposed to be 96.70%.\n\nGraphics and theme\n\nJellyfish Flow's graphics are beautiful, featuring an oceanic and jellyfish theme by Habanero's high-end design. Initially, the game offers 3 small reels, which are covered by various types of symbols. Alongside the multicolored wild jellyfish, there are also blue, green, red, and yellow jellyfish symbols. The mermaids move among seahorses, crabs, turtles, octopuses, and other creatures of the sea. The game's design is admirable.\n\nPotential payout\n\nJellyfish Flow has an enormous potential payout of up to 32,416x or 168,004x the bet, depending on the volatility option. But the game's actual RTP is subject to variation, with the floating average of around 96.69% or 96.70%. You need to match three icons to get a payout on consecutive reels. The top prize is only available in Ultra mode, but this is excellent news for high rollers who want to take the risk and win big.\n\nReel expansions and wilds\n\nThe great feature of Jellyfish Flow is the reel expansion based on Jellyfish Wilds that will land on the reels. Each of these symbols expands the game area, becomes sticky, and moves up one position for each round. Eventually, you can reach a game area of reels up to 7x7, but it's not an easy thing to do. The jellyfish wilds also serve as substitutes and help you form more winning combinations while they are around.\n\nTarget audience\n\nJellyfish Flow is a game for high-risk, high-reward players, especially veterans or those who play frequently. The game's colossal possible payouts and high volatility make it an unsuitable option for casual players or beginners who prefer to play with minimum bets and low risks. The cheerful musical theme and graphics of an oceanic theme should attract anyone who enjoys playing visually stunning games.\n\nSimilar slot games\n\nIf you enjoyed Jellyfish Flow, you might also want to try out Endemol's Maidens of the Sea slot. This 40-payline slot has four rows and five reels and can offer a maximum win of 200,000x. The theoretical RTP is 96.30%. It also has two reel modifiers that can replace symbols and create wilds on reels, as well as a free spins bonus. The Mermaids of the Sea slot is another game of the same provider, featuring three features that can increase potential payouts or provide a free spins bonus. The slot experts of the company have created a set of five reels and four rows that spin on 40 always active paylines.\n\n        \n            ",

It's also a cute game, with its floating jellyfish symbols and the ocean floor as its background. \n\nStarting with 3x3 reels and 27 ways to win, the game expands up to 7x7 reels, potentially reaching an impressive 823,543 ways to win. The game's potential is to pay a lot, up to 32,416x the stake, but that's just the base option. Turn on the Ultra setting, and the volatility becomes very high, while the rewards get an enormous increase, up to 168,004x the bet. Definitely not a game for everyone, but veterans are likely to appreciate it. As for features, it's based on wild and reel expansions, so the list isn't very long.\n\nThe graphics of Jellyfish Flow are beautiful, featuring an oceanic and jellyfish theme that showcases Habanero's high-end design. The developer is known for its excellent graphics in its games, which can also be found here. Jellyfish Flow initially offers 3 small reels, which are covered by various types of symbols. Alongside the multicolored wild jellyfish, there are also blue, green, red, and yellow jellyfish symbols.\n\nThe game's design is superb for a mid-level slot like this. We couldn't find any serious flaws, so for our expectations, the game satisfies the conditions for a gaming experience. The theme is the ocean, aka the ocean floor, where a number of mermaids move among seahorses, crabs, turtles, octopuses, and so on. There is a cheerful musical theme with gameplay that states the developers have made a serious attempt to provide a fun slot experience.\n\nJellyfish Flow is an impressive game for several reasons, but first and foremost is the potential payout and the enormous volatility of the Ultra mode that will draw your attention. I wouldn't recommend playing regularly in Ultra mode, as the regular version of the game is already quite volatile, and the payouts are above average there too. It's worth checking out, though, and I found it to be an interesting addition to the high-volatility category.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nYou will use 15 coins and start your bets from a minimum of 0.15 euros per spin. The upper limit tends to be quite high in Habanero slots, although I wouldn't expect the same here, as the game has such high volatility and enormous returns.\n\nThe game's potential varies depending on whether you play in regular or Ultra mode. The regular version of Jellyfish Flow is already considered an option with very high volatility and is capable of paying up to 32,416x the stake. Its RTP is probably around 96.69%, but as with RTP range games, online casinos can go lower or higher.\n\nAnd then, there is the Ultra mode. In this version of the slot machine, you can be paid up to 168,004x the stake, one of the biggest payouts that will ever be available in a regular game. Volatility gets a strong increase, up to Ultra High. Apparently, the volatility is 9 times higher than that of the regular version (which is already very high), but if the wins come in your favor, there are greater chances of changing your life. The RTP is supposed to be 96.70%, but again, lower or higher versions are possible in casinos, it all depends on them.\n\nThe way the game will give you winning combinations is through matching symbols that appear on consecutive reels. To get a win, three matching icons are required on as many reels. You start with 27 ways to win in a game area with 3x3 reels.\n\nThe great feature of this game is based on reel expansions. To do this, you'll need the Jellyfish Wild to land on the reels. Each of these symbols expands the game area but also becomes sticky and moves up one position for each round. Eventually, you can reach a game area of reels up to 7x7, but it's not an easy thing to do.\n\nJellyfish Wilds can be used as substitutes, so they will also help you form more winning combinations while they're around.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nDiscover what prizes may be hidden on the ocean floor when you play Endemol's Maidens of the Sea slot machine. This 40-payline slot has four rows and five reels that can offer a maximum win of 200,000x. The game also has two reel modifiers that can replace symbols and create wilds on reels, as well as a free spins bonus. The theoretical RTP is 96.30%.\n\nMermaids are real and exist in their underwater queendom in the Maidens of the Sea slot. The game features three features that can increase potential payouts or provide a free spins bonus. The slot experts of the company Endemol who are behind this game have created a reel-set of five reels and four rows that spin on 40 always active paylines.\n            ",

The game's potential is to pay a lot, up to 32,416x the stake, but that's just the base option. Turn on the Ultra setting, and the volatility becomes very high, while the rewards get an enormous increase, up to 168,004x the bet. Definitely not a game for everyone, but veterans are likely to appreciate it. As for features, it's based on wild and reel expansions, so the list isn't very long.\n\nThe graphics of Jellyfish Flow are beautiful, featuring an oceanic and jellyfish theme that showcases Habanero's high-end design. The developer is known for its excellent graphics in its games, which can also be found here. Jellyfish Flow initially offers 3 small reels, which are covered by various types of symbols. Alongside the multicolored wild jellyfish, there are also blue, green, red, and yellow jellyfish symbols.\n\nThe game's design is superb for a mid-level slot like this. We couldn't find any serious flaws, so for our expectations, the game satisfies the conditions for a gaming experience. The theme is the ocean, aka the ocean floor, where a number of mermaids move among seahorses, crabs, turtles, octopuses, and so on. There is a cheerful musical theme with gameplay that states the developers have made a serious attempt to provide a fun slot experience.\n\nJellyfish Flow is an impressive game for several reasons, but first and foremost is the potential payout and the enormous volatility of the Ultra mode that will draw your attention. I wouldn't recommend playing regularly in Ultra mode, as the regular version of the game is already quite volatile, and the payouts are above average there too. It's worth checking out, though, and I found it to be an interesting addition to the high-volatility category.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nYou will use 15 coins and start your bets from a minimum of 0.15 euros per spin. The upper limit tends to be quite high in Habanero slots, although I wouldn't expect the same here, as the game has such high volatility and enormous returns.\n\nThe game's potential varies depending on whether you play in regular or Ultra mode. The regular version of Jellyfish Flow is already considered an option with very high volatility and is capable of paying up to 32,416x the stake. Its RTP is probably around 96.69%, but as with RTP range games, online casinos can go lower or higher.\n\nAnd then, there is the Ultra mode. In this version of the slot machine, you can be paid up to 168,004x the stake, one of the biggest payouts that will ever be available in a regular game. Volatility gets a strong increase, up to Ultra High. Apparently, the volatility is 9 times higher than that of the regular version (which is already very high), but if the wins come in your favor, there are greater chances of changing your life. The RTP is supposed to be 96.70%, but again, lower or higher versions are possible in casinos, it all depends on them.\n\nThe way the game will give you winning combinations is through matching symbols that appear on consecutive reels. To get a win, three matching icons are required on as many reels. You start with 27 ways to win in a game area with 3x3 reels.\n\nThe great feature of this game is based on reel expansions. To do this, you'll need the Jellyfish Wild to land on the reels. Each of these symbols expands the game area but also becomes sticky and moves up one position for each round. Eventually, you can reach a game area of reels up to 7x7, but it's not an easy thing to do.\n\nJellyfish Wilds can be used as substitutes, so they will also help you form more winning combinations while they're around.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nDiscover what prizes may be hidden on the ocean floor when you play Endemol's Maidens of the Sea slot machine.
