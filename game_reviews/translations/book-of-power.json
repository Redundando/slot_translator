We're talking about Book of Power, developed by the provider Relax Gaming. It features a 5x3 grid, 10 fixed paylines, and an RTP of 96.11%, a value above the industry average. But let's dive into what this online machine offers and why it could become a favorite among experienced gamblers.\n\nGraphics of Book of Power Slot\nWe find ourselves in Egypt, in the center of a columned corridor dominated by giant statues where the game's grid is positioned, ready to also host theme-related symbols. In addition to the face cards ranging from 10 to Ace, which pay up to 15 times the bet, we then move on to specific icons such as the pyramid, scarab, sarcophagus, and explorer. The latter pays up to 500 times the bet.\n\nThere are also well-designed wilds, scatters, and animations that make the gameplay enjoyable without making this slot too simple, as it clearly relies on a theme that has already been seen many times.\n\nGame features and functions\nThe Book of Power slot has various bonus features that can make gameplay even more fun. Let's take a look at its free spins, which are triggered by 3, 4, or 5 scatters in the same turn, offering 10, 15, or 20 free spins. A special symbol is chosen that expands and can fill the entire reel to form new wins.\n\nLet's not forget the Power Free Spins feature, which is activated by Super Scatters positioned on reels 2, 3, or 4, causing the reels to become entirely golden.\n\nFinally, with the Power Bet and Bonus Buy functions, it's possible to double the bet in the first case and access the Free Spins or Super Free Spins round directly in the second case.\n\nFinal thoughts\nThe Book of Power slot, despite relying on a theme that has already been seen many times before for online slots, still manages to surprise. It has good gameplay, offers a simple slot experience, and has a good RTP value. Relax Gaming has created a title that will undoubtedly be talked about!\n\nFAQ\nIs the RTP of Book of Power slot considered too low?\nNo, its RTP is in line with the industry average (at 96.11%) and does not disappoint expectations.\n\nCan I play the Book of Power slot for free?\nYes, you can do so on our portal or by choosing online casinos that offer the For Fun version of the slot.
