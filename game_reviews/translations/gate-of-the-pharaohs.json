Developed by High 5 Games, this video slot features all of the sandy goodness (and none of the sand in your shoes) that you\\'d expect from a great Egyptian themed game.</p><p>With 12 symbols in total, including a Wild and a Bonus, you\\'ll be swept up in a world of mummies, treasures, and (unfortunately) some pretty scary scarabs. But fear not, your trusty slot companion is here to guide you through the game, and with up to 3,125 paylines, your chances of winning big are (almost) as good as those of uncovering an undiscovered tomb.</p><p>But wait, there\\'s more! With the option to increase the playing grid to an impressive 10x5, you could have up to 100,000 paylines to work with. That\\'s right, you read that correctly. 100,000. If that doesn\\'t make your heart flutter like the wings of a falcon, then you might want to book an appointment with your cardiologist.</p><p>Now, we must warn you that this slot is not for the faint of heart. It is highly volatile (which, in this case, means that the chances of winning are high, but so are the risks). That said, with an RTP of 96%, it\\'s worth taking a chance on this game. So don your explorer\\'s hat, grab your whip, and get ready to spin those reels!</p>'}"
