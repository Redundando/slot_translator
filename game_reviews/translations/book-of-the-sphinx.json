It is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot machine that allows for a maximum bet of €200. The game has a simple gameplay and graphics that are well done, albeit basic. However, the slot is capable of engaging both old and new players alike.\n\nGameplay and symbols\n\nBook of the Sphinx features both regular symbols and thematic symbols. The lower value symbols include poker cards, while the higher value symbols consist of Egyptian tablets with hieroglyphics, the deity Anobi, the Ankh, the golden scarab, and the pharaoh's sarcophagus, which has the highest payout of up to 2500 times the initial bet. The true protagonist of the game is the Book of the Sphinx symbol, which serves as both wild and scatter, allowing for the completion of a winning combination and access to free spins, up to a maximum of 30. It is also the highest paying symbol, with the value of the prize amounting to a remarkable 4000 times the initial bet if it appears on all five reels.\n\nImportance of Book of the Sphinx symbol\n\nThe Book of the Sphinx symbol plays a vital role in the game. As Wild, it replaces all other symbols to complete a win, as Scatter, it allows access to free spins, and as a special symbol, it has the highest payout of up to 4000 times the initial bet if it appears on all five reels. It is a symbol that provides players with the best chance of winning big and is one that players should keep an eye out for.\n\nGamble feature\n\nBook of the Sphinx comes with a Gamble feature that is suited for players who enjoy adrenaline rushes. After a win of any amount, a face-down playing card appears on the screen, and players have to guess its color. If the guess is correct, the win will be doubled, while an incorrect guess will result in a total loss of the win.\n\nSuitability for all players\n\nBook of the Sphinx is a game that is suitable for both players who appreciate the playful aspect of slots and do not like to invest large sums and for bolder players who like to make substantial bets in an attempt to win big. The wide range of bets ensures that all players can enjoy the game, regardless of their bankroll.\n\n        \n            ",

Even Book of the Sphinx, from Spielo, set its game on the banks of the Nile, with a slot that doesn't have amazing features or a particularly complex gameplay, but that fits into the series of classic and linear slots capable of engaging both old and new players! It is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot machine that allows for a maximum bet of ten coins per spin; the value of the coins ranges from €0.01 to €1, so the maximum amount that can be bet is €200.\nThe wide range of bets makes Book of the Sphinx suitable both for those who appreciate the playful aspect of slots and do not like to invest large sums, and for bolder players who like to make substantial bets trying to break the bank.\nThe graphics chosen for this slot by Spielo (which is part of the Lottomatica group) are quite well done although very simple, with a choice of warm colors in shades of yellow and orange and sound effects consistent with the theme.\nSymbols: cards and theme-related images\nAmong the regular symbols, those that have a lower value are the ubiquitous poker cards, with a maximum win of 100 times the bet; more substantial winnings come from thematic symbols, such as:\n\nEgyptian tablets with hieroglyphics\nThe deity Anobi\nThe Ankh, or cross of life\nThe golden scarab (Book of Ra Online)\nThe pharaoh's sarcophagus, whose value can reach up to a whopping 2500 times the initial bet\n\nThe book of the Sphinx: a single symbol that represents Wild and Scatter\nThe true protagonist of this slot is the Book of the Sphinx, which has the dual function of both Wild and Scatter.\nAs Wild, it serves as a wild card and can replace all other symbols, no exceptions, allowing for the completion of a winning combination; as Scatter, it allows access to free spins, up to a maximum of 30; finally, as a special symbol, it is the highest paying symbol: if it appears on all five reels, the value of the prize will amount to a remarkable 4000 times the initial bet, reaching the highest possible win!\nThe Gamble feature\nIf you are used to experiencing real adrenaline rushes, then the Gamble feature is for you! Following a win of any amount, a face-down playing card will appear on the screen, and you have to guess its color: if the bet is correct, the win will be doubled; otherwise, it will be lost entirely!\n            ",
