Ovviamente parliamo di fiori, scelti da NetEnt per raccontare un mondo nuovo attraverso le divertenti funzioni di questa macchinetta digitale. Ovviamente non parliamo di fiorellini classici, ma di una soluzione che presenta delle piante carnivore che hanno le sembianze umane. La griglia su cui si poseranno i simboli è composta da 5 rulli e 30 linee di pagamento. E’ prevista una lunga scala di scommessa che parte da 0,30 centesimi fino a 75 monete per spin, scegliendo di giocare da dispositivi desktop, mobile e quindi tablet. Per aumentare la vivacità del gioco ci sono poi le funzioni dei giri gratuiti e la possibilità di contare su un RTP che arriva a 96,32%. Ma per scoprire tutte le curiosità e molto altro ancora ti invitiamo a continuare a leggere la nostra recensione.\nGrafica e Simboli di gioco\nFlowers viene realizzata come una slot luminosa e graficamente semplice: non a caso ci troviamo in un campo, e qui abbiamo i simboli reali di basso valore A, K, Q e J pronti ad arricchire l’esperienza di gioco oltre ai 5 fiori protagonisti, che possono apparire in veste di simboli singoli o doppi. In quest’ultimo caso potrai formare delle combinazioni vincenti chiamando in causa fino a 10 simboli. Considera sempre che ottenere 5 simboli doppi vuol dire giocare come se avessi 10 singoli. Tra tutti i fiori però è quello Rosa ad avere un valore più alto: con 10 in combinazione potrai raggiungere il un moltiplicatore da sogno per la tua vincita.\nOgni possibile vincita si ottiene da sinistra a destra e può essere favorita dal simbolo del Sole che è il nostro Wild: ha il potere di sostituire tutti i simboli di gioco. Attenzione però alla possibilità di attivare la funzione Free Spins che si realizza se ottieni 4 o più simboli Scatter: potrai ottenere da 10 a 30 spin e le vincite che ottieni potranno essere soggette a un moltiplicatore che ha valore di 3x. Durante questo bonus game il giocatore potrà ottenere anche ulteriori giri extra fino a un massimo di 60 spin (una quantità allettante!).\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot machine Flowers\nNon è un game simbolo d’innovazione questo è abbastanza chiaro, ma è uno dei titoli più conosciuti di NetEnt, tanto da spingere poi il provider a presentare anche una variante del gioco, la versione Flowers Christmas Edition. E per arrivare a proporre lo stesso gameplay ma in chiave natalizia, vuol dire che qualcosa di buono questa slot online lo ha ottenuto!\nL’ottimo impatto che siamo a riscontrare è sicuramente legato alla scelta di puntare sui suoi doppi simboli, che aiutano a vincere ovviamente il doppio rispetto alla versione singola. E’ presto detto che se riesci a posizionare sul tuo display una griglia di doppi fiori Rosa, potresti ottenere una vittoria pari a 2.000 volte la puntata effettuata.

Of course, we are talking about flowers, chosen by NetEnt to depict a new world through the entertaining functions of this digital machine.

The grid on which the symbols will land is comprised of 5 reels and 30 paylines. A long range of betting is provided, starting from €0.30 up to 75 coins per spin, and can be played on desktop, mobile and tablet devices. To increase the liveliness of the game, there are also the functions of free spins and the possibility of counting on an RTP that reaches 96.32%. However, to discover all the curiosities and much more, we invite you to continue reading our review.\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nFlowers is created as a bright and graphically simple slot machine: not by chance are we located in a field, and here we have the real low value symbols A, K, Q and J ready to enrich the gaming experience, in addition to the 5 protagonist flowers, which can appear as single or double symbols. In the latter case, you can form winning combinations by invoking up to 10 symbols. Always consider that obtaining 5 double symbols means playing as if you had 10 single ones. Among all the flowers, however, it is the Rose that has a higher value: with 10 in combination, you can reach a dream multiplier for your win.\nEvery possible win is obtained from left to right and can be favored by the symbol of the Sun, which is our Wild: it has the power to replace all game symbols. However, pay attention to the possibility of activating the Free Spins function, which is realized if you obtain 4 or more Scatter symbols: you can get from 10 to 30 spins and the winnings you obtain can be subject to a 3x multiplier. During this bonus game, the player can also obtain additional extra spins up to a maximum of 60 spins (an enticing amount!).\nFinal Considerations on The Flowers Slot Machine\nThis game is not a symbol of innovation, that's quite clear, but it is one of the most well-known titles by NetEnt, so much so that the provider was then pushed to present a variation of the game, the Flowers Christmas Edition version. And to be able to propose the same gameplay but in a Christmas key, means that this online slot machine has obtained something good!\nThe excellent impact we are noticing is certainly related to the choice of betting on its double symbols, which naturally help to win twice as much as the single version. It is easy to say that if you manage to position a grid of double Rose flowers on your display, you could obtain a victory worth 2,000 times the bet placed. And that's not a bad option if you want to try out a simple but responsive machine! Nevertheless, it will take a bit of patience to obtain such luck; but Flowers is a solution dedicated precisely to the most patient gamblers!\n            ",

While playing the game, players can find low symbols such as A, K, Q, and J, along with five protagonist flowers that could appear as single or double symbols.

The game is a good option for patient gamblers who enjoy a straightforward slot experience.\n\n        \n            ",

Of course, we are talking about flowers, chosen by NetEnt to depict a new world through the entertaining functions of this digital machine. Yet we are not referring to classic little flowers, but rather to a solution that presents carnivorous plants that resemble humans. The grid on which the symbols will land is comprised of 5 reels and 30 paylines. A long range of betting is provided, starting from €0.30 up to 75 coins per spin, and can be played on desktop, mobile and tablet devices. To increase the liveliness of the game, there are also the functions of free spins and the possibility of counting on an RTP that reaches 96.32%. However, to discover all the curiosities and much more, we invite you to continue reading our review.\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nFlowers is created as a bright and graphically simple slot machine: not by chance are we located in a field, and here we have the real low value symbols A, K, Q and J ready to enrich the gaming experience, in addition to the 5 protagonist flowers, which can appear as single or double symbols. In the latter case, you can form winning combinations by invoking up to 10 symbols. Always consider that obtaining 5 double symbols means playing as if you had 10 single ones. Among all the flowers, however, it is the Rose that has a higher value: with 10 in combination, you can reach a dream multiplier for your win.\nEvery possible win is obtained from left to right and can be favored by the symbol of the Sun, which is our Wild: it has the power to replace all game symbols. However, pay attention to the possibility of activating the Free Spins function, which is realized if you obtain 4 or more Scatter symbols: you can get from 10 to 30 spins and the winnings you obtain can be subject to a 3x multiplier. During this bonus game, the player can also obtain additional extra spins up to a maximum of 60 spins (an enticing amount!).\nFinal Considerations on The Flowers Slot Machine\nThis game is not a symbol of innovation, that's quite clear, but it is one of the most well-known titles by NetEnt, so much so that the provider was then pushed to present a variation of the game, the Flowers Christmas Edition version. And to be able to propose the same gameplay but in a Christmas key, means that this online slot machine has obtained something good!\nThe excellent impact we are noticing is certainly related to the choice of betting on its double symbols, which naturally help to win twice as much as the single version. It is easy to say that if you manage to position a grid of double Rose flowers on your display, you could obtain a victory worth 2,000 times the bet placed. And that's not a bad option if you want to try out a simple but responsive machine! Nevertheless, it will take a bit of patience to obtain such luck; but Flowers is a solution dedicated precisely to the most patient gamblers!\n            ",
