Created by ReelPlay, it's the first slot to use the innovative Infinity Reels game engine. Each successive win adds 1 extra reel to the game, as well as increasing the multiplier by 1x. Expand the reels to 15 and a bonus of 888 times your bet is up for grabs. There's also a free spins feature where each expansion can increase a multiplier up to 4x. Bets start at 20 cents and go up to a maximum of 40 euros per spin.\n\nJoin the journey through the virtual jungles of Central America in search of lost gold with the El Dorado Infinity Reels slot. Developed by ReelPlay, this is the first slot to use the new Infinity Reels feature. Rather than having a set of fixed reels, the number of reels in this slot can expand. The game is based on the legend of El Dorado (the Golden King) who covered himself in gold dust before diving into Lake Guatavita. Now your task is to find the lost city of gold and win big!\n\nExquisite and Legendary Graphics\nEl Dorado Infinity Reels has a fresh, modern, and above all, colorful look. The setting is the Central American jungle. On the reels, you'll see blocks of stone that are filled with 6 lower value gems and 4 more rewarding Aztec masks. The Aztec man with the headdress is the wild. It replaces all standard symbols. It's all very impressive, supported by an outstanding soundtrack. No complaints about the design, therefore.\n\nEl Dorado Infinity Reels has a fresh, modern, and colorful design with stunning graphics. The game is set in the Central American jungle, with a sprawling waterfall, lush vegetation, and rays of sunlight piercing through the clouds. On the reels, you'll find various interesting symbols, well-designed and supported by a rip-roaring soundtrack. Additionally, some Aztec temples will appear once the reels expand to the right. Overall, the graphic standard is high, the symbols are unique, and players will be pleased with the first impression this game gives.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThere are no active paylines in this slot. In fact, wins are awarded for a minimum of five matching symbols adjacent to each other starting from the first. Every five identical symbols count as one win and the game adds another reel, and so on. Additionally, the game has some interesting bonus features that can increase the player's winnings.\n\nEach spin starts with three reels and four rows. Each winning combination will add another reel to the right. This will continue until a new winning combination is created. If it's not created, the reels will return to three.\n\nOnce a reel has been added to the game, a multiplier is activated. It starts at 1x and increases by 1x for each subsequent reel. When the Infinity Reels feature ends, winnings are calculated by multiplying the total number of winning symbols. Just like the Infinity Reels feature, there's no limit to how high the multiplier can go.\n\nIf you land 12 reels in one spinning sequence, you'll be awarded a jackpot worth 888 times your bet. This is called the Jackpot feature. As the reels grow, you'll notice a small box in the top right corner that will tell you how many more reels you need to win the Jackpot.\n\nWhen a winning combination is made with the Gold Pyramid scatter symbol, the Free Spins feature is activated. You'll be awarded 10 free spins, and each scatter symbol during this feature will reward you with an additional four free spins.\n\nThere are also four different levels of free spins. As the levels grow, the multipliers increase by 2x, 3x, and 4x the stake, and so does the RTP.\n\nLevel 1: 95.51% RTP;\nLevel 2: 95.91% RTP;\nLevel 3: 96.16% RTP;\nLevel 4: 96.54% RTP.\n\nWe were quite taken with the El Dorado Infinity Reels slot. The new mechanic takes a bit of getting used to. Do a few spins in play mode if you can. Once you've got your eye in, there's a lot to appreciate here. The sound and visuals are top-class, and the expanding multipliers and free spins can provide some top-notch action.\n\nFrom medium to high variance, you can win up to 357.65x your bets in the base game - in the Free Spins feature, you can win 6,250x your bets from each free spin. This is a promising start for Infinity Reels slots.

Tutto sommato, lo standard grafico è elevato, i simboli sono unici e i giocatori saranno soddisfatti della prima impressione che questo gioco dà.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nNon ci sono linee di pagamento attive in questa slot. Infatti, le vincite vengono assegnate per un minimo di cinque simboli corrispondenti uno accanto all’altro a partire dal primo. Ogni cinque simboli uguali valgono come una vincita e il gioco aggiunge un’altra bobina, e così via. Inoltre, il gioco ha alcune interessanti caratteristiche bonus che possono aumentare le vincite del giocatore.\nOgni giro inizia con tre rulli e quattro file. Ogni combinazione vincente aggiungerà un’altra bobina a destra. Questo continuerà fino a quando si crea una nuova combinazione vincente. Se non si crea, i rulli torneranno a tre.\nUna volta aggiunta una bobina al gioco, si attiva un moltiplicatore. Inizia a 1x e aumenta di 1x per ogni bobina successiva. Quando la funzione Infinity Reels termina, le vincite vengono calcolate moltiplicando il numero totale dei simboli vincenti. Proprio come la funzione Infinity Reels, non c’è limite a quanto alto può andare il moltiplicatore.\n \nSe atterri 12 rulli in una sequenza di rotazione, ti verrà assegnato un jackpot del valore di 888x la tua puntata. Questa è chiamata la funzione Jackpot. Man mano che le bobine crescono, noterete una piccola scatola nell’angolo in alto a destra che vi dirà di quante altre bobine avete bisogno per vincere il Jackpot.\nQuando si effettua una combinazione vincente con il simbolo di spargimento della Piramide d’Oro, si attiva la funzione Free Spins. Ti verranno assegnati 10 giri gratuiti e ogni simbolo scatter durante questa funzione ti ricompenserà con quattro giri gratuiti aggiuntivi.\nInoltre, ci sono quattro diversi livelli di trottole gratuite. Man mano che i livelli crescono, i moltiplicatori aumentano di 2x, 3x, e 4x il palo, e così anche l’RTP.\n\nLivello 1: 95,51% RTP;\nLivello 2: 95,91% RTP;\nLivello 3: 96,16% RTP;\nLivello 4: 96,54% RTP.\n\nSiamo stati abbastanza presi dalla slot El Dorado Infinity Reels. Il nuovo meccanico ci mette un po’ ad abituarsi. Fate qualche giro in modalità play se potete. Una volta che hai messo gli occhi dentro, c’è molto da apprezzare qui. Il suono e le immagini sono di prima classe e i moltiplicatori in espansione e le rotazioni libere possono fornire un po’ di azione al top.\nDa media ad alta varianza, si possono vincere fino a 357,65x le tue puntate nel gioco di base – nella funzione Free Spins, si possono vincere 6.250x le tue puntate da ogni giro gratis. Questo è un inizio promettente per le slot Infinity Reels. Nel complesso, il gioco El Dorado Infinity Reels offre qualcosa di diverso da quello che è disponibile e può anche pagare molto bene se la vostra fortuna è in gioco.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nViaggiate indietro nel tempo per visitare l’antico impero Maya e la sua piramide più impressionante fatta d’oro.

You will be awarded 10 free spins, and each scatter symbol during this feature will reward you with four additional free spins.\n\nMoreover, there are four different levels of free spins. As the levels increase, the multipliers increase by 2x, 3x, and 4x the stake, and so does the RTP.\n\nLevel 1: 95.51% RTP;\nLevel 2: 95.91% RTP;\nLevel 3: 96.16% RTP;\nLevel 4: 96.54% RTP.\n\nWe were quite taken with the El Dorado Infinity Reels slot. The new mechanic takes some getting used to. Do a few rounds in play mode if you can. Once you've put your eyes inside, there's a lot to appreciate here.

Created by ReelPlay, it's the first slot to use the innovative Infinity Reels game engine. Each successive win adds 1 extra reel to the game, as well as increasing the multiplier by 1x. Expand the reels to 15 and a bonus of 888 times your bet is up for grabs. There's also a free spins feature where each expansion can increase a multiplier up to 4x. Bets start at 20 cents and go up to a maximum of 40 euros per spin.\n\nJoin the journey through the virtual jungles of Central America in search of lost gold with the El Dorado Infinity Reels slot. Developed by ReelPlay, this is the first slot to use the new Infinity Reels feature. Rather than having a set of fixed reels, the number of reels in this slot can expand. The game is based on the legend of El Dorado (the Golden King) who covered himself in gold dust before diving into Lake Guatavita. Now your task is to find the lost city of gold and win big!\n\nExquisite and Legendary Graphics\nEl Dorado Infinity Reels has a fresh, modern, and above all, colorful look. The setting is the Central American jungle. On the reels, you'll see blocks of stone that are filled with 6 lower value gems and 4 more rewarding Aztec masks. The Aztec man with the headdress is the wild. It replaces all standard symbols. It's all very impressive, supported by an outstanding soundtrack. No complaints about the design, therefore.\n\nEl Dorado Infinity Reels has a fresh, modern, and colorful design with stunning graphics. The game is set in the Central American jungle, with a sprawling waterfall, lush vegetation, and rays of sunlight piercing through the clouds.

Overall, the graphic standard is high, the symbols are unique, and players will be pleased with the first impression this game gives.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThere are no active paylines in this slot. In fact, wins are awarded for a minimum of five matching symbols adjacent to each other starting from the first. Every five identical symbols count as one win and the game adds another reel, and so on. Additionally, the game has some interesting bonus features that can increase the player's winnings.\n\nEach spin starts with three reels and four rows. Each winning combination will add another reel to the right. This will continue until a new winning combination is created. If it's not created, the reels will return to three.\n\nOnce a reel has been added to the game, a multiplier is activated. It starts at 1x and increases by 1x for each subsequent reel. When the Infinity Reels feature ends, winnings are calculated by multiplying the total number of winning symbols. Just like the Infinity Reels feature, there's no limit to how high the multiplier can go.\n\nIf you land 12 reels in one spinning sequence, you'll be awarded a jackpot worth 888 times your bet. This is called the Jackpot feature. As the reels grow, you'll notice a small box in the top right corner that will tell you how many more reels you need to win the Jackpot.\n\nWhen a winning combination is made with the Gold Pyramid scatter symbol, the Free Spins feature is activated. You'll be awarded 10 free spins, and each scatter symbol during this feature will reward you with an additional four free spins.\n\nThere are also four different levels of free spins. As the levels grow, the multipliers increase by 2x, 3x, and 4x the stake, and so does the RTP.\n\nLevel 1: 95.51% RTP;\nLevel 2: 95.91% RTP;\nLevel 3: 96.16% RTP;\nLevel 4: 96.54% RTP.\n\nWe were quite taken with the El Dorado Infinity Reels slot. The new mechanic takes a bit of getting used to. Do a few spins in play mode if you can. Once you've got your eye in, there's a lot to appreciate here. The sound and visuals are top-class, and the expanding multipliers and free spins can provide some top-notch action.\n\nFrom medium to high variance, you can win up to 357.65x your bets in the base game - in the Free Spins feature, you can win 6,250x your bets from each free spin. This is a promising start for Infinity Reels slots. Overall, the El Dorado Infinity Reels game offers something different from what's available and can also pay out very well if your luck is in.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nTravel back in time to visit the ancient Mayan empire and its most impressive pyramid made of gold. This is the premise of the El Dorado The City of Gold slot made by Pragmatic Play. The game offers many symbols made of gold and jungle animals to create an atmosphere that gets you in the game.\n\nIn addition to basic wins, El Dorado the City of Gold has colossal symbols, a money collection game, win multipliers, scatter symbols, and a wild. From an aesthetic point of view, it's a real Pragmatic Play game production, where the art is recognizable from afar and the gameplay dynamics involve a quality adventure.\n            ",

On the reels, you'll find various interesting symbols, well-designed and supported by a rip-roaring soundtrack. Additionally, some Aztec temples will appear once the reels expand to the right. Overall, the graphic standard is high, the symbols are unique, and players will be pleased with the first impression this game gives.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThere are no active paylines in this slot. In fact, wins are awarded for a minimum of five matching symbols adjacent to each other starting from the first. Every five identical symbols count as one win and the game adds another reel, and so on. Additionally, the game has some interesting bonus features that can increase the player's winnings.\n\nEach spin starts with three reels and four rows. Each winning combination will add another reel to the right. This will continue until a new winning combination is created. If it's not created, the reels will return to three.\n\nOnce a reel has been added to the game, a multiplier is activated. It starts at 1x and increases by 1x for each subsequent reel. When the Infinity Reels feature ends, winnings are calculated by multiplying the total number of winning symbols. Just like the Infinity Reels feature, there's no limit to how high the multiplier can go.\n\nIf you land 12 reels in one spinning sequence, you'll be awarded a jackpot worth 888 times your bet. This is called the Jackpot feature. As the reels grow, you'll notice a small box in the top right corner that will tell you how many more reels you need to win the Jackpot.\n\nWhen a winning combination is made with the Gold Pyramid scatter symbol, the Free Spins feature is activated. You'll be awarded 10 free spins, and each scatter symbol during this feature will reward you with an additional four free spins.\n\nThere are also four different levels of free spins. As the levels grow, the multipliers increase by 2x, 3x, and 4x the stake, and so does the RTP.\n\nLevel 1: 95.51% RTP;\nLevel 2: 95.91% RTP;\nLevel 3: 96.16% RTP;\nLevel 4: 96.54% RTP.\n\nWe were quite taken with the El Dorado Infinity Reels slot. The new mechanic takes a bit of getting used to. Do a few spins in play mode if you can. Once you've got your eye in, there's a lot to appreciate here. The sound and visuals are top-class, and the expanding multipliers and free spins can provide some top-notch action.\n\nFrom medium to high variance, you can win up to 357.65x your bets in the base game - in the Free Spins feature, you can win 6,250x your bets from each free spin. This is a promising start for Infinity Reels slots. Overall, the El Dorado Infinity Reels game offers something different from what's available and can also pay out very well if your luck is in.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nTravel back in time to visit the ancient Mayan empire and its most impressive pyramid made of gold. This is the premise of the El Dorado The City of Gold slot made by Pragmatic Play. The game offers many symbols made of gold and jungle animals to create an atmosphere that gets you in the game.\n\nIn addition to basic wins, El Dorado the City of Gold has colossal symbols, a money collection game, win multipliers, scatter symbols, and a wild. From an aesthetic point of view, it's a real Pragmatic Play game production, where the art is recognizable from afar and the gameplay dynamics involve a quality adventure.\n            ",
