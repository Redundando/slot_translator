It has 5 reels and 1024 paylines, and it is available for free at IGT. The screen is framed by golden columns decorated with precious hieroglyphs.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe Crown of Egypt online slot machine doesn't require any downloading, and it can be played using one to thirty coins per spin. The Auto Spin feature allows you to play up to a thousand automatic plays. The game has a 5000 coins jackpot at stake on your total bet with an RTP of 95.03%.\n\nWinning Combinations\n\nThe Crown of Egypt slot game offers players 1024 winning combinations per spin with rotation from both sides, thanks to the special MultiWay Xtra feature. This game also includes a Wild symbol that can replace any symbol to complete winning combinations and a Scatter symbol represented by a Pyramid.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe Scatter symbol in the Crown of Egypt slot is essential as it can start the Free Spins bonus. If you manage to collect enough symbols, you can check your winning combinations directly from the Paytable feature available within the site.\n\nBetting Limits\n\nAlthough the Crown of Egypt offers potential for free spins, the betting limits set by IGT are quite low. The maximum betting value is only 2.40€. Experienced gamblers may find this limiting, but less experienced players can still enjoy the game’s hidden treasures and symbols. Always try the free demo mode before committing real money.\n\n        \n            ",
