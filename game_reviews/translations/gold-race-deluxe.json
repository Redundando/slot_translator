Now let's take a closer look at Gold Race Deluxe.\n\nAs you might expect, it's a game inspired by athletics races. The graphics are well-crafted, with well-drawn symbols and a driving music that sets the pace of the game. The game board has a golden frame and a black background.\n\nUnlike other Espresso slots, the underlying console is rich in information and options rather than minimalist, as is the style of this software house.\n\nGold Race Deluxe Features\nThe game board is 6x3, with five active reels and the sixth coming into play under certain conditions that we'll see later. Bets depend on the selected step and are placed using coins worth €0.01. So at step one, the cost of each spin will cost only €0.50. At the top step, step five, the coins will be 250.\n\nThere are 1,431 ways to win. You win by lining up identical symbols on adjacent reels starting from the left and proceeding to the right. You can set automatic spins and some winning or losing limits. The RTP is very good, at 97.15%.\n\nSymbols and Features\nIn Gold Race Deluxe, there are basic symbols of two types, low and high level. The first ones are worth less and are playing cards from 10 to Ace, with the second ones increasing in value. From the lowest to the highest, we find the suitcase full of money, the gold watch and precious stones, the yacht, and finally the private plane.\n\nNow, let's move on to the bonuses, surely the gem of this slot. The Gold credit card is our Spreading Wild, which can only appear on reel 2. From here, it moves to adjacent boxes, transforming the corresponding symbols into Wilds, up to a maximum of four!\n\nThe key, on the other hand, transforms into a Wild, behaving as we have seen before and also unlocks the sixth reel, to which the 1,431 ways to win are linked. Furthermore, winning combinations can be obtained starting from the right reel to the left, as in regular play, but also from the left to the right.\n\nIf three Extra Race symbols appear, one of the three icons of the little man running will appear.

The mechanics are simple: every time we play, a portion of our bets go towards the final jackpot, which increases progressively. With each winning combination, we gain points that allow us to climb the leaderboard and ultimately, if we're in the lead, win big.\n\nAbove the game board, we can see a countdown timer before the game ends, and on a box to the right, the continuously updated leaderboard. Now let's take a closer look at Gold Race Deluxe.\n\nAs you might expect, it's a game inspired by athletics races. The graphics are well-crafted, with well-drawn symbols and a driving music that sets the pace of the game. The game board has a golden frame and a black background.\n\nUnlike other Espresso slots, the underlying console is rich in information and options rather than minimalist, as is the style of this software house.\n\nGold Race Deluxe Features\nThe game board is 6x3, with five active reels and the sixth coming into play under certain conditions that we'll see later. Bets depend on the selected step and are placed using coins worth €0.01. So at step one, the cost of each spin will cost only €0.50. At the top step, step five, the coins will be 250.\n\nThere are 1,431 ways to win. You win by lining up identical symbols on adjacent reels starting from the left and proceeding to the right. You can set automatic spins and some winning or losing limits. The RTP is very good, at 97.15%.\n\nSymbols and Features\nIn Gold Race Deluxe, there are basic symbols of two types, low and high level. The first ones are worth less and are playing cards from 10 to Ace, with the second ones increasing in value. From the lowest to the highest, we find the suitcase full of money, the gold watch and precious stones, the yacht, and finally the private plane.\n\nNow, let's move on to the bonuses, surely the gem of this slot. The Gold credit card is our Spreading Wild, which can only appear on reel 2. From here, it moves to adjacent boxes, transforming the corresponding symbols into Wilds, up to a maximum of four!\n\nThe key, on the other hand, transforms into a Wild, behaving as we have seen before and also unlocks the sixth reel, to which the 1,431 ways to win are linked. Furthermore, winning combinations can be obtained starting from the right reel to the left, as in regular play, but also from the left to the right.\n\nIf three Extra Race symbols appear, one of the three icons of the little man running will appear. Each of them is assigned a multiplier: bronze x50, silver x75, gold x100.\n            ",

The mechanics are simple: every time we play, a portion of our bets go towards the final jackpot, which increases progressively. With each winning combination, we gain points that allow us to climb the leaderboard and ultimately, if we're in the lead, win big.\n\nAbove the game board, we can see a countdown timer before the game ends, and on a box to the right, the continuously updated leaderboard. Now let's take a closer look at Gold Race Deluxe.\n\nAs you might expect, it's a game inspired by athletics races. The graphics are well-crafted, with well-drawn symbols and a driving music that sets the pace of the game. The game board has a golden frame and a black background.\n\nUnlike other Espresso slots, the underlying console is rich in information and options rather than minimalist, as is the style of this software house.\n\nGold Race Deluxe Features\nThe game board is 6x3, with five active reels and the sixth coming into play under certain conditions that we'll see later. Bets depend on the selected step and are placed using coins worth €0.01. So at step one, the cost of each spin will cost only €0.50. At the top step, step five, the coins will be 250.\n\nThere are 1,431 ways to win. You win by lining up identical symbols on adjacent reels starting from the left and proceeding to the right. You can set automatic spins and some winning or losing limits. The RTP is very good, at 97.15%.\n\nSymbols and Features\nIn Gold Race Deluxe, there are basic symbols of two types, low and high level. The first ones are worth less and are playing cards from 10 to Ace, with the second ones increasing in value. From the lowest to the highest, we find the suitcase full of money, the gold watch and precious stones, the yacht, and finally the private plane.\n\nNow, let's move on to the bonuses, surely the gem of this slot. The Gold credit card is our Spreading Wild, which can only appear on reel 2. From here, it moves to adjacent boxes, transforming the corresponding symbols into Wilds, up to a maximum of four!\n\nThe key, on the other hand, transforms into a Wild, behaving as we have seen before and also unlocks the sixth reel, to which the 1,431 ways to win are linked. Furthermore, winning combinations can be obtained starting from the right reel to the left, as in regular play, but also from the left to the right.\n\nIf three Extra Race symbols appear, one of the three icons of the little man running will appear. Each of them is assigned a multiplier: bronze x50, silver x75, gold x100.\n            ",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a review of the game \"Gold Race Deluxe\".\n\nPlease provide an FAQ:\n\n- 8 questions\n- Use simple language and provide practical takeaways.\n- Respond with a JSON!\n- Use the key \"faq\" and an array with the keys \"question\" and \"answer\". \n\nReview: Gold Race Deluxe is part of a series of slot games created by Espresso, designed to challenge players with a huge prize pool. The mechanics are simple: every time we play, a portion of our bets go towards the final jackpot, which increases progressively. With each winning combination, we gain points that allow us to climb the leaderboard and ultimately, if we're in the lead, win big.\n\nAbove the game board, we can see a countdown timer before the game ends, and on a box to the right, the continuously updated leaderboard. Now let's take a closer look at Gold Race Deluxe.\n\nAs you might expect, it's a game inspired by athletics races. The graphics are well-crafted, with well-drawn symbols and a driving music that sets the pace of the game. The game board has a golden frame and a black background.\n\nUnlike other Espresso slots, the underlying console is rich in information and options rather than minimalist, as is the style of this software house.\n\nGold Race Deluxe Features\nThe game board is 6x3, with five active reels and the sixth coming into play under certain conditions that we'll see later. Bets depend on the selected step and are placed using coins worth €0.01. So at step one, the cost of each spin will cost only €0.50. At the top step, step five, the coins will be 250.\n\nThere are 1,431 ways to win. You win by lining up identical symbols on adjacent reels starting from the left and proceeding to the right. You can set automatic spins and some winning or losing limits. The RTP is very good, at 97.15%.\n\nSymbols and Features\nIn Gold Race Deluxe, there are basic symbols of two types, low and high level. The first ones are worth less and are playing cards from 10 to Ace, with the second ones increasing in value. From the lowest to the highest, we find the suitcase full of money, the gold watch and precious stones, the yacht, and finally the private plane.\n\nNow, let's move on to the bonuses, surely the gem of this slot. The Gold credit card is our Spreading Wild, which can only appear on reel 2. From here, it moves to adjacent boxes, transforming the corresponding symbols into Wilds, up to a maximum of four!\n\nThe key, on the other hand, transforms into a Wild, behaving as we have seen before and also unlocks the sixth reel, to which the 1,431 ways to win are linked. Furthermore, winning combinations can be obtained starting from the right reel to the left, as in regular play, but also from the left to the right.\n\nIf three Extra Race symbols appear, one of the three icons of the little man running will appear. Each of them is assigned a multiplier: bronze x50, silver x75, gold x100.\n            ",
