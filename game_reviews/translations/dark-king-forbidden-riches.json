Land wildly in the Hotspot Zone and become sticky for the rest of the turn, in addition to awarding an extra free spin. Find out more about this rather haunting fantasy in our in-depth review of the Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot.\n\nThe new game from NetEnt, Dark King: Forbidden Riches, seems to stay true to its word for the most part, offering a very dark atmosphere and fantasy-inspired graphics that will involve more than a few human skulls. Where it seems to fall short is delivering those forbidden riches, as I didn't find its payouts too exciting.\n\nThe Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot is a 5×3 reels and 20 paylines slot machine, the usual setup for most games these days. It will have rewards that go up to 2,000x the bet, with an RTP of 96.06%, which I'm good with. Its features mainly focus on wilds and multipliers, along with free spins with sticky wilds.\n\nDark and ominous graphics\nThere is a rather oppressive feeling of darkness in the design of the Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot. In fact, it's really eerie. With a fantasy theme, a room in the castle of the Black King is the setting. There is a fantastic, orchestral soundtrack that plays while spinning and creates a very suggestive atmosphere. For example, it's not the Scooby Doo type of fear. It's dark, rather threatening, and it works very well.\n\nAccompanied by skulls and an armored knight, the reels are filled with medieval-style symbols from A to 10 symbols next to 5 higher-paying skeleton warriors. The faceless dark king is the most rewarding symbol. It will give you a prize of 1, 7.5, or 25 x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline. The same winnings are also offered by the blue wild globe that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\n\nThe Dark King: Forbidden Riches Mobile Slot has been fully optimized for Apple iOS and Android devices. You will find the same simple gameplay and high-class design on the mobile version. The graphics are rather dark, and we preferred to play on a larger screen. It works quite well on mobile devices, though.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe blue orbs are symbols that will serve as wild symbols in Dark King: Forbidden Riches. They appear on the reels, to form combinations with, by themselves or when they serve as substitutes. They pay very well, as much as the jackpot symbol, so it's always nice to see them make an appearance.\n\nThe Blue Orb wilds have an extra gift to offer, provided that at least two of them appear at the same time. You get a multiplier boost for all round winnings, based on the number of wilds present, and up to 5x enhancements are possible for winnings in each round in which up to 5 wilds appear.\n\nNaturally, there are also free spins present here, and they are easily triggered if you get the required scatters. 3 to 5 symbols of this type are needed, on a similar number of reels, to get from 10 to 15 free spins.\n\nThe central positions on reels 2 and 4, together with the complete 3rd reel, will be covered by a special hot zone. If the wild symbols land in those areas, they become sticky for this feature, also adding 1 extra spin to the total. The beauty here is that the up to 5x multiplier applied by wilds to all the winnings is still possible, and now the game takes into account both regular and sticky wilds.\n\nAs you place your bet, from a minimum value of just 0.20 euros, there is the possibility to go up to 400 euros per spin. This would mean line bets up to 20 euros, which should be higher if you get the biggest rewards.\n\nAs for the winnings in question, up to 2,000x the bet will be paid in a single round, which would mean up to 800,000 euros for those who can afford to use the highest bet setting.\n\nThe slot's volatility is medium to high, which isn't a great combination when paired with a maximum payout of only 2,000x. Otherwise, there are multipliers inside that can help, and the RTP is set at 96.06%, so the game seems to be in good shape on these fronts.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAnother dark-themed game is Microgaming's Immortal Romance, which is one of the most popular online slots ever. The Immortal Romance slot is from Microgaming and has 5 reels and 243 ways to win. Playable at 30p per spin on all devices, this vampire-themed game is iconic and becomes a cult favorite. It comes with a series of bonus features where you can benefit from a maximum of 5 random wild reels in the base game. The Chamber of Spins gives you access to 4 features, and you can get up to 25 free spins with all wins multiplied by 5.",

I punti salienti includono moltiplicatori selvaggi che possono aumentare le vincite fino a 5x così come una funzione Free Spins che premia 10, 12 o 15 giri gratis. Atterrate selvaggiamente nella Hotspot Zone e diventano appiccicosi per il resto del turno, oltre ad assegnare un giro gratis extra. Scoprite di più su questa fantasia piuttosto inquietante nella nostra recensione approfondita della Slot Dark King: Forbidden Riches.\nIl nuovo gioco di NetEnt, Dark King: Forbidden Riches, sembra rimanere fedele alla sua parola per la maggior parte, offrendo un’atmosfera molto dark e una grafica ispirata alla fantasia che coinvolgerà più di qualche teschio umano. Dove sembra fallire, è quando si tratta di consegnare quelle ricchezze proibite, dato che non ho trovato i suoi pagamenti così eccitanti.\nLa Slot Dark King: Forbidden Riches è una slot machine con 5×3 rulli e 20 linee di pagamento, il solito setup della maggior parte dei giochi di questi tempi. Avrà ricompense che arrivano fino a 2.000x la posta in gioco, il tutto mentre la RTP è al 96,06% con cui sono bravo. Tra le sue caratteristiche, il gioco si concentrerà soprattutto su wilds e moltiplicatori, insieme a giri gratis con wilds appiccicosi.\nUna grafica oscura e tenebrosa\nC’è una sensazione di oscurità piuttosto opprimente nel design della Slot Dark King: Forbidden Riches. In effetti è davvero inquietante. Con un tema di fantasia, una camera nel castello del Re Nero è l’ambientazione. C’è una colonna sonora fantastica, orchestrale, che volteggia via mentre si gira e che crea un’atmosfera molto suggestiva. Per farti un esempio, non è il tipo di paura alla Scooby Doo. È buio, piuttosto minaccioso e funziona molto bene.\nAffiancati da teschi e da un cavaliere in armatura, i rulli sono composti da simboli in stile medievale da A a 10 simboli accanto a 5 guerrieri scheletrici paganti più alti. Il re oscuro senza volto è il simbolo più gratificante. Ti darà un premio di 1, 7,5 o 25 x la tua puntata totale se atterri 3, 4 o 5 su una linea di pagamento. Queste stesse vincite sono offerte anche dal globo blu selvatico che sostituisce tutti i simboli, a parte la dispersione.\nLa Slot Mobile di Dark King: Forbidden Riches è stata completamente ottimizzata per dispositivi Apple iOS e Android. Troverete lo stesso semplice gameplay e lo stesso design di alta classe sulla versione mobile. La grafica è piuttosto scura e abbiamo preferito giocare su uno schermo più grande. Funziona abbastanza bene sui dispositivi portatili, però.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nLe sfere blu sono simboli che serviranno come simboli selvaggi in Dark King: Forbidden Riches. Si ottengono sui rulli, per formare combinazioni con, da soli o quando fungono da sostituti. Loro pagano molto bene, tanto quanto il simbolo del jackpot, così è sempre bello vederli fare un’apparizione.\nI Blue Orb wilds hanno un regalo in più da fare, a patto che ne compaiano almeno due allo stesso tempo. Si ottiene un aumento moltiplicatore per tutte le vittorie del round, in base al numero di wilds presenti, e sono possibili fino a 5x potenziamenti per le vittorie in ogni giro in cui compaiono fino a 5 wilds.\nNaturalmente, anche i giri liberi sono presenti qui, e si attivano facilmente se si ottengono gli scatter richiesti. Sono necessari da 3 a 5 simboli di questo tipo, su un numero simile di bobine, per ottenere da 10 a 15 giri liberi.\nLe posizioni centrali sulle bobine 2 e 4, insieme alla 3a bobina completa, saranno coperte da una speciale zona calda. Se i simboli jolly atterrano in quelle zone, diventano appiccicosi per questa caratteristica, aggiungendo anche 1 giro in più al totale. Il bello è che il moltiplicatore fino a 5x applicato da wild a tutte le vittorie è ancora possibile, e ora il gioco tiene conto sia dei wild regolari che di quelli appiccicosi.\nMentre si prende la scommessa, dal valore minimo di soli 0,20 euro, c’è la possibilità di arrivare fino a 400 euro per giro. Questo significherebbe scommesse di linea fino a 20 euro, che dovrebbero essere maggiori se si ottengono le ricompense più grandi.\nPer quanto riguarda le vincite in questione, fino a 2.000x la puntata sarà pagata in un solo giro, il che significherebbe fino a 800.000 euro per coloro che possono permettersi di utilizzare la più alta impostazione della scommessa.\nLa volatilità della slot è medio-alta, che non è una grande combinazione, quando la si accoppia con un payout massimo di soli 2.000x. Altrimenti, ci sono dei moltiplicatori all’interno che possono aiutare, e l’RTP è impostato al 96,06%, quindi su questi fronti il gioco sembra a posto.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nUn altro gioco dal tema oscuro è Immortal Romance di Microgaming che è una delle slot online più popolari di sempre. La slot Immortal Romance è della Microgaming e ha 5 rulli e 243 modi per vincere. Giocabile tutto su dispositivi da 30p un giro su tutti i dispositivi, questo gioco a tema vampiresco è iconico e diventa il preferito dai cult. Viene fornito con una serie di caratteristiche bonus in cui è possibile beneficiare di un massimo di 5 rulli selvaggi a caso nel gioco base. La Camera delle Rotazioni ti dà accesso a 4 funzio\n        ",

Land wildly in the Hotspot Zone and become sticky for the rest of the round, in addition to receiving an extra free spin. Discover more about this rather unsettling fantasy in our in-depth review of the Dark King: Forbidden Riches Slot.\n\nNetEnt's new game, Dark King: Forbidden Riches, seems to stay true to its word for the most part, offering a very dark atmosphere and fantasy-inspired graphics that will involve more than a few human skulls. Where it seems to fail is when it comes to delivering those forbidden riches, as I didn't find its payouts to be all that exciting.\n\nThe Dark King: Forbidden Riches Slot is a 5x3 reel slot machine with 20 paylines, the usual setup for most games these days. It will have rewards that go up to 2,000x the stake in play, all while the RTP is at 96.06% with which I'm good. Among its features, the game will focus mostly on wilds and multipliers, along with free spins with sticky wilds.\n\nA dark and gloomy graphics\n\nThere is a rather oppressive feeling of darkness in the design of the Dark King: Forbidden Riches Slot. In fact, it's really unsettling. With a fantasy theme, a room in the Black King's castle is the setting. There is a fantastic orchestral soundtrack that plays away as you spin the reels, creating a very suggestive atmosphere. To give you an example, it's not the Scooby Doo kind of scare. It's dark, rather menacing, and it works very well.\n\nFlanked by skulls and a knight in armor, the reels are composed of medieval-style symbols from A to 10 symbols alongside 5 higher-paying skeletal warriors. The faceless dark king is the most rewarding symbol. It will give you a prize of 1, 7.5 or 25x your total bet if you land 3, 4 or 5 on a payline. These same payouts are also offered by the blue wild globe that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\n\nThe Dark King: Forbidden Riches Mobile Slot has been fully optimized for Apple iOS and Android devices. You will find the same simple gameplay and high-class design on the mobile version. The graphics are quite dark and we preferred to play on a larger screen. It works pretty well on portable devices, though.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nThe blue orbs are symbols that will serve as wild symbols in Dark King: Forbidden Riches. You get them on the reels, to form combinations with, either on their own or when they act as substitutes. They pay very well, just like the jackpot symbol, so it's always nice to see them make an appearance.\n\nThe Blue Orb wilds have one more gift to give, provided that at least two of them appear at the same time. You get a multiplier boost for all round wins, based on the number of wilds present, and up to 5x enhancements for wins in any round they appear up to 5 wilds.\n\nOf course, free spins are also present here, and they are easy to activate if you get the required scatters. 3 to 5 symbols of this type are needed, on a similar number of reels, to get 10 to 15 free spins.\n\nThe central positions on reels 2 and 4, along with the 3rd complete reel, will be covered by a special hot zone. If wild symbols land in those zones, they become sticky for this feature, also adding 1 extra spin to the total. The beauty is that the up to 5x wild multiplier applied to all wins is still possible, and now the game takes into account both regular and sticky wilds.\n\nWhile taking the bet, from a minimum value of just €0.20, there is a chance to reach up to €400 per spin. This would mean line bets up to €20, which should be higher if you get the bigger rewards.\n\nAs for the winnings in question, up to 2,000x the bet will be paid in a single spin, which would mean up to €800,000 for those who can afford to use the highest bet setting.\n\nThe slot volatility is medium to high, which isn't a great match when paired with a maximum payout of just 2,000x. Otherwise, there are multipliers inside that can help, and the RTP is set at 96.06%, so on these fronts the game seems to be in good shape.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nAnother dark-themed game is Microgaming's Immortal Romance, which is one of the most popular online slots of all time. The Immortal Romance Slot is from Microgaming and features 5 reels and 243 ways to win. Playable on all devices from 30p a spin, this vampire-themed game is iconic and becomes a cult favorite. It comes with a range of bonus features where you can benefit from a maximum of 5 random wild reels in the base game. The Chamber of Spins gives you access to 4 functions."

Land wildly in the Hotspot Zone and become sticky for the rest of the turn, in addition to awarding an extra free spin. Find out more about this rather haunting fantasy in our in-depth review of the Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot.\n\nThe new game from NetEnt, Dark King: Forbidden Riches, seems to stay true to its word for the most part, offering a very dark atmosphere and fantasy-inspired graphics that will involve more than a few human skulls. Where it seems to fall short is delivering those forbidden riches, as I didn't find its payouts too exciting.\n\nThe Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot is a 5×3 reels and 20 paylines slot machine, the usual setup for most games these days. It will have rewards that go up to 2,000x the bet, with an RTP of 96.06%, which I'm good with. Its features mainly focus on wilds and multipliers, along with free spins with sticky wilds.\n\nDark and ominous graphics\nThere is a rather oppressive feeling of darkness in the design of the Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot. In fact, it's really eerie. With a fantasy theme, a room in the castle of the Black King is the setting. There is a fantastic, orchestral soundtrack that plays while spinning and creates a very suggestive atmosphere. For example, it's not the Scooby Doo type of fear. It's dark, rather threatening, and it works very well.\n\nAccompanied by skulls and an armored knight, the reels are filled with medieval-style symbols from A to 10 symbols next to 5 higher-paying skeleton warriors. The faceless dark king is the most rewarding symbol. It will give you a prize of 1, 7.5, or 25 x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline. The same winnings are also offered by the blue wild globe that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\n\nThe Dark King: Forbidden Riches Mobile Slot has been fully optimized for Apple iOS and Android devices. You will find the same simple gameplay and high-class design on the mobile version. The graphics are rather dark, and we preferred to play on a larger screen. It works quite well on mobile devices, though.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe blue orbs are symbols that will serve as wild symbols in Dark King: Forbidden Riches. They appear on the reels, to form combinations with, by themselves or when they serve as substitutes. They pay very well, as much as the jackpot symbol, so it's always nice to see them make an appearance.\n\nThe Blue Orb wilds have an extra gift to offer, provided that at least two of them appear at the same time. You get a multiplier boost for all round winnings, based on the number of wilds present, and up to 5x enhancements are possible for winnings in each round in which up to 5 wilds appear.\n\nNaturally, there are also free spins present here, and they are easily triggered if you get the required scatters. 3 to 5 symbols of this type are needed, on a similar number of reels, to get from 10 to 15 free spins.\n\nThe central positions on reels 2 and 4, together with the complete 3rd reel, will be covered by a special hot zone. If the wild symbols land in those areas, they become sticky for this feature, also adding 1 extra spin to the total. The beauty here is that the up to 5x multiplier applied by wilds to all the winnings is still possible, and now the game takes into account both regular and sticky wilds.\n\nAs you place your bet, from a minimum value of just 0.20 euros, there is the possibility to go up to 400 euros per spin. This would mean line bets up to 20 euros, which should be higher if you get the biggest rewards.\n\nAs for the winnings in question, up to 2,000x the bet will be paid in a single round, which would mean up to 800,000 euros for those who can afford to use the highest bet setting.\n\nThe slot's volatility is medium to high, which isn't a great combination when paired with a maximum payout of only 2,000x. Otherwise, there are multipliers inside that can help, and the RTP is set at 96.06%, so the game seems to be in good shape on these fronts.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAnother dark-themed game is Microgaming's Immortal Romance, which is one of the most popular online slots ever. The Immortal Romance slot is from Microgaming and has 5 reels and 243 ways to win. Playable at 30p per spin on all devices, this vampire-themed game is iconic and becomes a cult favorite.

The game is inspired by dark fantasy with haunting graphics and a foreboding soundtrack. It features wild multipliers, free spins with sticky wilds, and attractive payouts of up to 2,000x the bet.\n\nGraphics and Soundtrack\n\nDark King: Forbidden Riches has a gloomy and eerie atmosphere created with dark graphics and a mesmerizing orchestral soundtrack. The attention to detail in the visuals enhances the gaming experience by immersing players in the fantasy world of the dark king. The sounds are ominous and contribute to the feeling of impending danger.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nThe slot features 5 high-paying skeleton warriors and the faceless dark king symbol. Along with that, it also includes the standard A to 10 symbols. The symbols and paylines are all intricately designed to fit the fantasy theme.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nThe blue wild globes replace all symbols except the scatter and are the most rewarding symbol in the game, along with the dark king symbol. The wilds also have multipliers that can enhance winnings by up to 5x. The scatter symbol triggers the Free Spins feature and requires three to five symbols.\n\nFree Spins and Bonus Features\n\nThe Free Spins feature is triggered when three to five scatter symbols appear on the screen. The player is rewarded with 10, 12, or 15 free spins depending on the number of scatter symbols. The Hotspot Zone, which covers the central positions on reels two and four and the entire third reel, only applies to free spins. If the wild lands in this area, it becomes sticky for the rest of the turn and awards an extra free spin. The multiplier boost by wilds still applies during the free spins, and with sticky wilds, both regular and sticky wilds are taken into account, enhancing the chances to win.\n\nRTP and Maximum Payout\n\nThe game's return to player (RTP) is 96.06%, which is average for an online slot. The maximum payout is up to 2,000x the bet, which may not appeal to high rollers, but the medium to high volatility of the game ensures that players can still win often enough. The maximum bet is 400 euros per spin, and it is recommended to bet higher values for the biggest rewards.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game has a simple gameplay structure with easy-to-follow rules. The medium-to-high volatility and potential payout of up to 2,000x the bet create a balanced gaming experience. The game also has stunning graphics and a haunting soundtrack that immerses the player in the fantasy world of the dark king.\n\nMobile Compatibility\n\nThe Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot machine has been fully optimized for Apple iOS and Android devices, allowing players to play on-the-go. The mobile version of the game has the same design as the desktop version, with dark and ominous graphics that look good on a small screen.\n\n        \n            ",

Land wildly in the Hotspot Zone and become sticky for the rest of the turn, in addition to awarding an extra free spin. Find out more about this rather haunting fantasy in our in-depth review of the Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot.\n\nThe new game from NetEnt, Dark King: Forbidden Riches, seems to stay true to its word for the most part, offering a very dark atmosphere and fantasy-inspired graphics that will involve more than a few human skulls. Where it seems to fall short is delivering those forbidden riches, as I didn't find its payouts too exciting.\n\nThe Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot is a 5×3 reels and 20 paylines slot machine, the usual setup for most games these days. It will have rewards that go up to 2,000x the bet, with an RTP of 96.06%, which I'm good with. Its features mainly focus on wilds and multipliers, along with free spins with sticky wilds.\n\nDark and ominous graphics\nThere is a rather oppressive feeling of darkness in the design of the Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot. In fact, it's really eerie. With a fantasy theme, a room in the castle of the Black King is the setting. There is a fantastic, orchestral soundtrack that plays while spinning and creates a very suggestive atmosphere. For example, it's not the Scooby Doo type of fear. It's dark, rather threatening, and it works very well.\n\nAccompanied by skulls and an armored knight, the reels are filled with medieval-style symbols from A to 10 symbols next to 5 higher-paying skeleton warriors. The faceless dark king is the most rewarding symbol. It will give you a prize of 1, 7.5, or 25 x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline. The same winnings are also offered by the blue wild globe that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\n\nThe Dark King: Forbidden Riches Mobile Slot has been fully optimized for Apple iOS and Android devices. You will find the same simple gameplay and high-class design on the mobile version. The graphics are rather dark, and we preferred to play on a larger screen. It works quite well on mobile devices, though.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe blue orbs are symbols that will serve as wild symbols in Dark King: Forbidden Riches. They appear on the reels, to form combinations with, by themselves or when they serve as substitutes. They pay very well, as much as the jackpot symbol, so it's always nice to see them make an appearance.\n\nThe Blue Orb wilds have an extra gift to offer, provided that at least two of them appear at the same time. You get a multiplier boost for all round winnings, based on the number of wilds present, and up to 5x enhancements are possible for winnings in each round in which up to 5 wilds appear.\n\nNaturally, there are also free spins present here, and they are easily triggered if you get the required scatters. 3 to 5 symbols of this type are needed, on a similar number of reels, to get from 10 to 15 free spins.\n\nThe central positions on reels 2 and 4, together with the complete 3rd reel, will be covered by a special hot zone. If the wild symbols land in those areas, they become sticky for this feature, also adding 1 extra spin to the total. The beauty here is that the up to 5x multiplier applied by wilds to all the winnings is still possible, and now the game takes into account both regular and sticky wilds.\n\nAs you place your bet, from a minimum value of just 0.20 euros, there is the possibility to go up to 400 euros per spin. This would mean line bets up to 20 euros, which should be higher if you get the biggest rewards.\n\nAs for the winnings in question, up to 2,000x the bet will be paid in a single round, which would mean up to 800,000 euros for those who can afford to use the highest bet setting.\n\nThe slot's volatility is medium to high, which isn't a great combination when paired with a maximum payout of only 2,000x. Otherwise, there are multipliers inside that can help, and the RTP is set at 96.06%, so the game seems to be in good shape on these fronts.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAnother dark-themed game is Microgaming's Immortal Romance, which is one of the most popular online slots ever. The Immortal Romance slot is from Microgaming and has 5 reels and 243 ways to win. Playable at 30p per spin on all devices, this vampire-themed game is iconic and becomes a cult favorite. It comes with a series of bonus features where you can benefit from a maximum of 5 random wild reels in the base game.

Created by NetEnt, this superbly designed 5-reel, 25-payline game combines stunning visuals and sounds with fiery gameplay. The highlights include wild multipliers that can boost your winnings up to 5x, as well as a Free Spins feature that rewards 10, 12, or 15 free spins.

Land wildly in the Hotspot Zone and become sticky for the rest of the turn, in addition to awarding an extra free spin. Find out more about this rather haunting fantasy in our in-depth review of the Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot.\n\nThe new game from NetEnt, Dark King: Forbidden Riches, seems to stay true to its word for the most part, offering a very dark atmosphere and fantasy-inspired graphics that will involve more than a few human skulls. Where it seems to fall short is delivering those forbidden riches, as I didn't find its payouts too exciting.\n\nThe Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot is a 5×3 reels and 20 paylines slot machine, the usual setup for most games these days. It will have rewards that go up to 2,000x the bet, with an RTP of 96.06%, which I'm good with. Its features mainly focus on wilds and multipliers, along with free spins with sticky wilds.\n\nDark and ominous graphics\nThere is a rather oppressive feeling of darkness in the design of the Dark King: Forbidden Riches slot. In fact, it's really eerie. With a fantasy theme, a room in the castle of the Black King is the setting. There is a fantastic, orchestral soundtrack that plays while spinning and creates a very suggestive atmosphere. For example, it's not the Scooby Doo type of fear. It's dark, rather threatening, and it works very well.\n\nAccompanied by skulls and an armored knight, the reels are filled with medieval-style symbols from A to 10 symbols next to 5 higher-paying skeleton warriors. The faceless dark king is the most rewarding symbol. It will give you a prize of 1, 7.5, or 25 x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline. The same winnings are also offered by the blue wild globe that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\n\nThe Dark King: Forbidden Riches Mobile Slot has been fully optimized for Apple iOS and Android devices. You will find the same simple gameplay and high-class design on the mobile version. The graphics are rather dark, and we preferred to play on a larger screen. It works quite well on mobile devices, though.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe blue orbs are symbols that will serve as wild symbols in Dark King: Forbidden Riches. They appear on the reels, to form combinations with, by themselves or when they serve as substitutes. They pay very well, as much as the jackpot symbol, so it's always nice to see them make an appearance.\n\nThe Blue Orb wilds have an extra gift to offer, provided that at least two of them appear at the same time. You get a multiplier boost for all round winnings, based on the number of wilds present, and up to 5x enhancements are possible for winnings in each round in which up to 5 wilds appear.\n\nNaturally, there are also free spins present here, and they are easily triggered if you get the required scatters. 3 to 5 symbols of this type are needed, on a similar number of reels, to get from 10 to 15 free spins.\n\nThe central positions on reels 2 and 4, together with the complete 3rd reel, will be covered by a special hot zone. If the wild symbols land in those areas, they become sticky for this feature, also adding 1 extra spin to the total. The beauty here is that the up to 5x multiplier applied by wilds to all the winnings is still possible, and now the game takes into account both regular and sticky wilds.\n\nAs you place your bet, from a minimum value of just 0.20 euros, there is the possibility to go up to 400 euros per spin. This would mean line bets up to 20 euros, which should be higher if you get the biggest rewards.\n\nAs for the winnings in question, up to 2,000x the bet will be paid in a single round, which would mean up to 800,000 euros for those who can afford to use the highest bet setting.\n\nThe slot's volatility is medium to high, which isn't a great combination when paired with a maximum payout of only 2,000x. Otherwise, there are multipliers inside that can help, and the RTP is set at 96.06%, so the game seems to be in good shape on these fronts.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAnother dark-themed game is Microgaming's Immortal Romance, which is one of the most popular online slots ever.
