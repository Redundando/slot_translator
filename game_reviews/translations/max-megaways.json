Behind them are the enhancers that we see in detail:\n\nDouble Multiplier: a double multiplier is applied to the wins\nDuplicated Wilds: every wild that lands transforms the entire reel into wilds\n2 Additional Scatters: we receive additional free spins\nIncreased chances of winning: at least five symbols appear on the reels\nHigh-level symbols: only precious stone symbols land on the reels\n\nDuring the base game, one of the following random modifiers may appear:\n\nMaximum Megaways: all reels have 7 symbols, so we can play for the 117,649 ways to win\nVertical Wild: all symbols on a reel are transformed into Jolly\nHorizontal Wild: symbols on the horizontal reel are transformed into Jolly\nWild Bomb: a special wild explodes, destroying the symbols that are then replaced by totally new symbols.\n\nFrequently asked questions\nHow many ways to win are there in Max Megaways?\n\nIn Max Megaways, there are 117,649 ways to win.\n\nIs the theoretical return for Max Megaways good?\n\nThe RTP value is 96.37%, above the average of most slot games, very good!\n\nWhere can I play Max Megaways?\n\nIn all major legal casinos, those certified by AAMS, the only reliable ones!\n        ",

The cascading mechanism means that following a winning combo, all paying symbols are removed and replaced with brand new ones. The top horizontal reel is destined for four symbols and is the only one that can accommodate special symbols. The minimum bet is € 0.20 and like all Megaways slots, there are many ways to win, to be precise, 117,649.\n\nYou win when at least three identical symbols are associated.

As in all slots, even in Max Megaways the playing cards are the ones that are worth the least, followed by the precious stones. The Wild symbol covers the classic function of the Jolly, appears only on the horizontal reel and replaces all symbols except for the Scatters.

In the case of the bars, with three scatters, we receive ten free spins and can open two of the five doors that appear on the screen. In the case of the diamond, we can open three doors. Behind them are the enhancers that we see in detail:\n\nDouble Multiplier: a double multiplier is applied to the wins\nDuplicated Wilds: every wild that lands transforms the entire reel into wilds\n2 Additional Scatters: we receive additional free spins\nIncreased chances of winning: at least five symbols appear on the reels\nHigh-level symbols: only precious stone symbols land on the reels\n\nDuring the base game, one of the following random modifiers may appear:\n\nMaximum Megaways: all reels have 7 symbols, so we can play for the 117,649 ways to win\nVertical Wild: all symbols on a reel are transformed into Jolly\nHorizontal Wild: symbols on the horizontal reel are transformed into Jolly\nWild Bomb: a special wild explodes, destroying the symbols that are then replaced by totally new symbols.\n\nFrequently asked questions\nHow many ways to win are there in Max Megaways?\n\nIn Max Megaways, there are 117,649 ways to win.\n\nIs the theoretical return for Max Megaways good?\n\nThe RTP value is 96.37%, above the average of most slot games, very good!\n\nWhere can I play Max Megaways?\n\nIn all major legal casinos, those certified by AAMS, the only reliable ones!\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame Mechanics\n\nMax Megaways has six reels that can hold from two to seven symbols for each spin. The cascading mechanism means that following a winning combo, all paying symbols are removed and replaced with brand new ones. The top horizontal reel is destined for four symbols and is the only one that can accommodate special symbols. There are 117,649 ways to win and the volatility is high, with an RTP figure of 96.32%. Players can activate the Autoplay mode, which allows them to activate from 5 to 100 automatic spins.\n\nBonus Features\n\nMax Megaways offers many regular and special bonuses. The playing cards are the ones that are worth the least, followed by the precious stones. The Wild symbol replaces all symbols except for the Scatters and appears only on the horizontal reel. The Scatters are represented by the secret agent's suitcase containing gold bars or a diamond. Three scatters trigger ten free spins and two of the five doors that appear on the screen can be opened in the case of gold bars. In the case of diamonds, three doors can be opened. The enhancers include a double multiplier, duplicated wilds, additional scatters, increased chances of winning, and only precious stone symbols on the reels. During the base game, random modifiers such as Maximum Megaways, Vertical Wild, Horizontal Wild, and Wild Bomb can appear.\n\nSymbols\n\nMax Megaways has ten regular symbols, with playing cards worth the least, followed by precious stones. The Wild symbol replaces all symbols except for the Scatters. The Scatters are represented by the secret agent's suitcase containing gold bars or a diamond.\n\nBetting Options\n\nThe minimum bet for Max Megaways is € 0.20, and there are 117,649 ways to win with many betting options. Players can activate the Autoplay mode, allowing them to activate from 5 to 100 automatic spins.\n\nCertification and Legality\n\nMax Megaways can be played in all major legal casinos, those certified by AAMS, which are the only reliable ones.

We find ourselves in front of a mountain, which is actually not a mountain, but the secret refuge of our protagonist. In the background, we can see the calm sea and the clouds crossing a sky as blue as the one in Australia, the country of origin of Big Time Gaming, the developer of this beautiful slot.\n\nBets for every budget\nIn Max Megaways, we have a grid with six reels that can hold from two to seven symbols for each spin. The cascading mechanism means that following a winning combo, all paying symbols are removed and replaced with brand new ones. The top horizontal reel is destined for four symbols and is the only one that can accommodate special symbols. The minimum bet is € 0.20 and like all Megaways slots, there are many ways to win, to be precise, 117,649.\n\nYou win when at least three identical symbols are associated. For those who get bored of continuously clicking the Play button, we recommend activating the Autoplay mode, which allows you to activate from 5 to 100 automatic spins.\n\nThe volatility is high, and the RTP figure corresponds to 96.32%.\n\nDifferent regular and special bonuses\nLet's now take a look at the regular symbols, which are ten. As in all slots, even in Max Megaways the playing cards are the ones that are worth the least, followed by the precious stones. The Wild symbol covers the classic function of the Jolly, appears only on the horizontal reel and replaces all symbols except for the Scatters. These are represented by the secret agent's suitcase: one contains gold bars, the other a diamond. Let's see now what changes if one or the other lands. In the case of the bars, with three scatters, we receive ten free spins and can open two of the five doors that appear on the screen. In the case of the diamond, we can open three doors.

We find ourselves in front of a mountain, which is actually not a mountain, but the secret refuge of our protagonist. In the background, we can see the calm sea and the clouds crossing a sky as blue as the one in Australia, the country of origin of Big Time Gaming, the developer of this beautiful slot.\n\nBets for every budget\nIn Max Megaways, we have a grid with six reels that can hold from two to seven symbols for each spin. The cascading mechanism means that following a winning combo, all paying symbols are removed and replaced with brand new ones. The top horizontal reel is destined for four symbols and is the only one that can accommodate special symbols. The minimum bet is € 0.20 and like all Megaways slots, there are many ways to win, to be precise, 117,649.\n\nYou win when at least three identical symbols are associated. For those who get bored of continuously clicking the Play button, we recommend activating the Autoplay mode, which allows you to activate from 5 to 100 automatic spins.\n\nThe volatility is high, and the RTP figure corresponds to 96.32%.\n\nDifferent regular and special bonuses\nLet's now take a look at the regular symbols, which are ten. As in all slots, even in Max Megaways the playing cards are the ones that are worth the least, followed by the precious stones. The Wild symbol covers the classic function of the Jolly, appears only on the horizontal reel and replaces all symbols except for the Scatters. These are represented by the secret agent's suitcase: one contains gold bars, the other a diamond. Let's see now what changes if one or the other lands. In the case of the bars, with three scatters, we receive ten free spins and can open two of the five doors that appear on the screen. In the case of the diamond, we can open three doors. Behind them are the enhancers that we see in detail:\n\nDouble Multiplier: a double multiplier is applied to the wins\nDuplicated Wilds: every wild that lands transforms the entire reel into wilds\n2 Additional Scatters: we receive additional free spins\nIncreased chances of winning: at least five symbols appear on the reels\nHigh-level symbols: only precious stone symbols land on the reels\n\nDuring the base game, one of the following random modifiers may appear:\n\nMaximum Megaways: all reels have 7 symbols, so we can play for the 117,649 ways to win\nVertical Wild: all symbols on a reel are transformed into Jolly\nHorizontal Wild: symbols on the horizontal reel are transformed into Jolly\nWild Bomb: a special wild explodes, destroying the symbols that are then replaced by totally new symbols.\n\nFrequently asked questions\nHow many ways to win are there in Max Megaways?\n\nIn Max Megaways, there are 117,649 ways to win.\n\nIs the theoretical return for Max Megaways good?\n\nThe RTP value is 96.37%, above the average of most slot games, very good!\n\nWhere can I play Max Megaways?\n\nIn all major legal casinos, those certified by AAMS, the only reliable ones!\n        ",
