The game has been around for over ten years, but it still competes with modern slots, thanks to its well-crafted graphics and special effects. The game takes you on an underwater adventure, where you can encounter creatures like oysters, pearls, lobsters, seahorses, and of course, dolphins. This marine-themed slot game offers simple gameplay that can help you increase your winnings.\n\nGameplay and features\n\nDolphin’s Pearl offers a straightforward gameplay experience with exciting features. The game has five reels and nine paylines, with a maximum win that is obtained when aligning five dolphins. The Wild symbol, represented by the dolphin, can replace any other symbol to determine a winning combination. Additionally, the Scatter symbol, the oyster with the pearl inside, gives 15 free spins in which all winnings are tripled when appearing in more than three numbers. The game also features an Autoplay option that allows players to relax and enjoy the gameplay without having to spin the reels manually continuously.\n\nSymbols and graphics\n\nThe symbols in Dolphin's Pearl reflect the underwater world and include oysters, pearls, lobsters, and seahorses alongside classic playing cards from 9 to Ace. The graphics are well-crafted, and the game provides you with an immersive underwater experience that doesn't lose its charm over time. The dolphin symbol, the Wild, is the game’s protagonist and visually stunning. The oyster with the pearl, on the other hand, is the Scatter symbol, providing players with opportunities to increase their winnings.\n\nSimilar games\n\nIf you enjoy the marine theme, Dolphin’s Pearl might be the perfect slot game for you.

Another option is King of Atlantis by IGT, which combines the underwater world with Greek and Roman mythology and the story of the lost city of Atlantis, led by Poseidon himself. Lastly, for those who prefer a linear graphic and a simple interface, Big Catch from Novomatic is an excellent game that offers a colorful and fun gaming experience.\n\nRTP\n\nDolphin’s Pearl has an RTP of 94.24%, meaning that the theoretical payout percentage for this slot game overall is 94.24%.

RTP corresponds to the theoretical payout percentage, i.e., the percentage of the amount that the player has wagered and that could potentially be returned to them.\nSlots similar to Dolphin\nThe marine theme is not new in both slot machines and VLTs, and has been widely developed by various software houses.\nA very adventurous version of this theme is Sea Hunter, signed by Play’n GO, where the game moves in the depths of the abyss, dealing with terrifying killer whales and every variety of fish.\nIf, on the other hand, you want to combine the underwater world with history, IGT offers King of Atlantis, where the story of the lost city of Atlantis is enriched with the protagonists of Greek and Roman mythology, led by Poseidon himself!\nFor those who love the marine theme but are not attracted to overly flashy slots and prefer a linear graphic, we remember Big Catch, also from the German Novomatic, which offers a very colorful and fun gaming experience.\n            ",
