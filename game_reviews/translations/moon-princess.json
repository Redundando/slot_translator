Ecco, diciamo che pur non trattandosi del gioco ufficiale, la slot machine online Moon Princess è il gioco stellare che stavi cercando. Le protagoniste di questo titolo sono delle principesse in perfetto stile anime giapponese, pronte a regalare Free Spin e premi che arrivano fino a 5.000 gettoni. Per vincere di più bisognerà trovare il moltiplicatore, che arriva a offrirti fino a 20 volte la tua scommessa. Tutto ciò che devi fare è metterti comodo e lasciarti conquistare dalle magiche avventure di queste principesse, che sono Love, Star e Storm.\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nLa grafica richiama in modo incredibile i colori e l’idea di Sailor Moon: i disegni rispettano bene i classici giapponesi e sono capaci di allietare il giocatore con le animazioni di gioco. Moon Princess nasce con 5 rulli e 20 payline, sulle quali è possibile scommettere da 0.20 a 100 gettoni per giro. E’ altamente volatile e si possono ottenere importanti vittorie con 3 o più simboli in fila, sia allineati verticalmente che in orizzontale. Ogni volta che realizzi una combinazione vincente, i simboli che la formano saranno eliminati, in modo da fare spazio a nuove possibili icone vincenti. Al centro di una combinazione si presenterà poi un simbolo della Luna, che è il Wild della slot e permette di sostituire ogni icona, oltre a trasformare anche la tua scommessa fino a 50 volte con moltiplicatore 5x.\nIl bonus game Girl Power si potrà attivare in modo del tutto casuale su uno spin che non è vincente. In base alla principessa che apparirà sono previse diverse funzioni che favoriscono l’unione di simboli vincenti. Nel caso della Love Princess puoi scegliere 1 set di simboli che si trasformano. Con la Star Princess avrai invece 1 o 2 Wild in aggiunta sulla tua griglia di gioco. E infine con la Storm Princess potrai contare su 2 set di simboli rimossi dalla griglia. Ma non dimentichiamo il ruolo di Trinity, principessa che arriva quando si ottengono vittorie solo con le principesse: il suo scopo è di attribuire un X numero di giri gratis. Qualora il giocatore riesca a eliminare tutti i simboli, si attiva poi la funzione Spin gratuiti, che variano in base alla principessa. Inoltre, liberando il tabellone di gioco è possibile ricevere una vittoria fino a 100 volte la scommessa eseguita.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Moon Princess\nVale davvero la pena provare questa affascinante slot machine che è stata realizzata dalla software house Play N Go. Il suo successo le ha permesso di essere resa disponibile su qualsiasi dispositivo mobile o su desktop. Non perde nulla a livello di gamplay e di grafica anche su schermi di dimensioni più piccole. Il gioco prevede massima volatilità (10/10) e ha un RTP predefinito che arriva a quota 96,50%. Riesce a differenziarsi tra i tanti titoli presenti nel settore del gambling online grazie alle sue nuove funzionalità sorprendenti.

The protagonists of this title are princesses in the perfect Japanese anime style, ready to give away free spins and prizes of up to 5,000 coins. To win more, you'll need to find the multiplier, which can offer up to 20 times your bet. All you have to do is get comfortable and let yourself be enchanted by the magical adventures of these princesses, who are Love, Star, and Storm.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe graphics incredibly evoke the colors and idea of Sailor Moon: the drawings do well to respect the classic Japanese style and delight the player with game animations. Moon Princess has 5 reels and 20 paylines, on which you can bet from 0.20 to 100 coins per spin. It is highly volatile and important wins can be obtained with 3 or more symbols in a row, both vertically and horizontally aligned. Whenever you achieve a winning combination, the symbols that form it will be eliminated, making room for new possible winning icons. In the center of a combination, a symbol of the Moon will then appear, which is the slot's Wild and allows us to replace any icon, as well as transform your bet up to 50 times with a 5x multiplier.\n\nThe Girl Power bonus game can be activated at random on a spin that is not winning. Depending on the princess that appears, there are different functions that favor the union of winning symbols. In the case of the Love Princess, you can choose 1 set of symbols that are transformed. With the Star Princess, you will have 1 or 2 Wilds added to your game board. And finally, with the Storm Princess, you can rely on 2 sets of symbols removed from the grid. But let's not forget the role of Trinity, the princess that arrives when wins are achieved only with the princesses: her purpose is to award a number of free spins. If the player manages to eliminate all the symbols, then the Free Spin function is activated, which varies depending on the princess.

It is highly volatile with a default RTP of 96.50%. The game allows you to bet from 0.20 to 100 coins per spin and offers the chance to win up to 5,000 coins.\n\nGameplay features and how to win\n\nMoon Princess offers gameplay features such as symbols being eliminated when a winning combination is achieved, creating room for new symbols. The center symbol is the Wild which allows you to replace any icon, as well as transform your bet up to 50 times with a 5x multiplier. To win, you need to get 3 or more symbols in a row, both vertically and horizontally aligned. To win more, you need to find the multiplier, which can offer up to 20 times your bet.\n\nGirl Power bonus game and Free Spin function\n\nThe Girl Power bonus game can be activated at random on a spin that is not winning. Depending on the princess that appears, there are different functions that favor the union of winning symbols. If you achieve a winning combination only with the princess symbols, Trinity princess will appear and award a number of free spins. Additionally, by clearing the game board, you can receive a prize of up to 100 times the bet made.\n\nAnime theme and characters\n\nMoon Princess is an anime-themed slot game that features princesses in the perfect Japanese anime style. The graphics incredibly evoke the colors and idea of Sailor Moon: the drawings do well to respect the classic Japanese style and delight the player with game animations. The protagonists of this game are Love, Star, and Storm.\n\nAvailability on desktop and mobile devices\n\nMoon Princess is available on both desktop and mobile devices. The game does not lose anything in terms of gameplay and graphics even on smaller screens. It has amazing new features that differentiate it from many titles present in the online gambling sector and was created by the software house Play N Go.\n\n        \n            ",

Well, even though it's not the official game, the online slot machine Moon Princess is the stellar game you've been looking for. The protagonists of this title are princesses in the perfect Japanese anime style, ready to give away free spins and prizes of up to 5,000 coins. To win more, you'll need to find the multiplier, which can offer up to 20 times your bet. All you have to do is get comfortable and let yourself be enchanted by the magical adventures of these princesses, who are Love, Star, and Storm.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe graphics incredibly evoke the colors and idea of Sailor Moon: the drawings do well to respect the classic Japanese style and delight the player with game animations. Moon Princess has 5 reels and 20 paylines, on which you can bet from 0.20 to 100 coins per spin. It is highly volatile and important wins can be obtained with 3 or more symbols in a row, both vertically and horizontally aligned. Whenever you achieve a winning combination, the symbols that form it will be eliminated, making room for new possible winning icons. In the center of a combination, a symbol of the Moon will then appear, which is the slot's Wild and allows us to replace any icon, as well as transform your bet up to 50 times with a 5x multiplier.\n\nThe Girl Power bonus game can be activated at random on a spin that is not winning. Depending on the princess that appears, there are different functions that favor the union of winning symbols. In the case of the Love Princess, you can choose 1 set of symbols that are transformed. With the Star Princess, you will have 1 or 2 Wilds added to your game board. And finally, with the Storm Princess, you can rely on 2 sets of symbols removed from the grid. But let's not forget the role of Trinity, the princess that arrives when wins are achieved only with the princesses: her purpose is to award a number of free spins. If the player manages to eliminate all the symbols, then the Free Spin function is activated, which varies depending on the princess. Also, by clearing the game board, you can receive a prize of up to 100 times the bet made.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Moon Princess slot\nIt is really worth trying out this fascinating slot machine that has been created by the software house Play N Go. Its success has allowed it to be made available on any mobile device or desktop. It does not lose anything in terms of gameplay and graphics even on smaller screens. The game is highly volatile (10/10) and has a default RTP of 96.50%. It manages to differentiate itself from the many titles present in the online gambling sector thanks to its amazing new features. These three princesses of great beauty and radiant smiles are ready to challenge you!\n            ",

Well, even though it's not the official game, the online slot machine Moon Princess is the stellar game you've been looking for. The protagonists of this title are princesses in the perfect Japanese anime style, ready to give away free spins and prizes of up to 5,000 coins. To win more, you'll need to find the multiplier, which can offer up to 20 times your bet. All you have to do is get comfortable and let yourself be enchanted by the magical adventures of these princesses, who are Love, Star, and Storm.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe graphics incredibly evoke the colors and idea of Sailor Moon: the drawings do well to respect the classic Japanese style and delight the player with game animations. Moon Princess has 5 reels and 20 paylines, on which you can bet from 0.20 to 100 coins per spin. It is highly volatile and important wins can be obtained with 3 or more symbols in a row, both vertically and horizontally aligned. Whenever you achieve a winning combination, the symbols that form it will be eliminated, making room for new possible winning icons. In the center of a combination, a symbol of the Moon will then appear, which is the slot's Wild and allows us to replace any icon, as well as transform your bet up to 50 times with a 5x multiplier.\n\nThe Girl Power bonus game can be activated at random on a spin that is not winning. Depending on the princess that appears, there are different functions that favor the union of winning symbols. In the case of the Love Princess, you can choose 1 set of symbols that are transformed. With the Star Princess, you will have 1 or 2 Wilds added to your game board. And finally, with the Storm Princess, you can rely on 2 sets of symbols removed from the grid. But let's not forget the role of Trinity, the princess that arrives when wins are achieved only with the princesses: her purpose is to award a number of free spins. If the player manages to eliminate all the symbols, then the Free Spin function is activated, which varies depending on the princess. Also, by clearing the game board, you can receive a prize of up to 100 times the bet made.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Moon Princess slot\nIt is really worth trying out this fascinating slot machine that has been created by the software house Play N Go. Its success has allowed it to be made available on any mobile device or desktop. It does not lose anything in terms of gameplay and graphics even on smaller screens. The game is highly volatile (10/10) and has a default RTP of 96.50%. It manages to differentiate itself from the many titles present in the online gambling sector thanks to its amazing new features. These three princesses of great beauty and radiant smiles are ready to challenge you!\n        ",
