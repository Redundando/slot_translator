One of their latest releases is \"Alien Planets\", a slot machine that excels in its simplicity and efficiency, leaving little room for complicated rules or hyper-technological graphics.\n\nThe theme is easily recognizable from the title itself, as it takes place on an alien planet where the cute, funny-looking Martians are the protagonists of the game.\n\nUnlike most of Tuko Productions' games, \"Alien Planets\" does not use special effects or graphics to impress players. Instead, it relies on the solid and intuitive gameplay to provide a satisfying, yet easy gaming experience.\n\nFor those who want to try the slot without any commitment, we recommend the play-for-fun version, which allows you to discover all its secrets and tricks for free while practicing before betting real money.\n\nStructure of the Slot, Betting Range and RTP\n\n\"Alien Planets\" does not have any particular feature when it comes to the structure of the slot: it has the typical five reels and only 15 pay lines, with a betting range of 15 cents to 30€ per spin. The coin’s value is between 0.01 and 2€. Its limited betting range makes it a suitable game for beginners or anyone who doesn't like to invest significant amounts of money.\n\nThe return to player (RTP) of this space-themed slot machine is more than satisfactory at 96.45%, perfectly in line with the other Tuko Productions slots.\n\nSymbols and Special Features\n\nThe gameplay of Tuko's slot games is always the same: win with alignments of identical symbols on adjacent reels, but starting from the left to the right. There is always a Wild symbol, a Scatter symbol, and often a Bonus that allows access to a mini-game.\n\n\"Alien Planets\" follows the same structure: symbols on the reels are represented by cute, funny-looking aliens and \"royals\" (playing cards from Jack to Ace). The Wild symbol is a colorful planet that has the function of a joker and can also create winning combinations on its own. The Scatter symbol is represented by multicolored crystals that give players free spins and multipliers when appearing at least three times on the reels, regardless of their position.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Alien Planets\" is a simple yet satisfying slot machine that guarantees a great gameplay experience. With its cuddly and adorable aliens, it brings a unique twist and adds fun to your online gaming sessions.\n            ",

One of their latest releases is \"Alien Planets\", a slot machine that excels in its simplicity and efficiency, leaving little room for complicated rules or hyper-technological graphics.\n\nThe theme is easily recognizable from the title itself, as it takes place on an alien planet where the cute, funny-looking Martians are the protagonists of the game.\n\nUnlike most of Tuko Productions' games, \"Alien Planets\" does not use special effects or graphics to impress players. Instead, it relies on the solid and intuitive gameplay to provide a satisfying, yet easy gaming experience.\n\nFor those who want to try the slot without any commitment, we recommend the play-for-fun version, which allows you to discover all its secrets and tricks for free while practicing before betting real money.\n\nStructure of the Slot, Betting Range and RTP\n\n\"Alien Planets\" does not have any particular feature when it comes to the structure of the slot: it has the typical five reels and only 15 pay lines, with a betting range of 15 cents to 30€ per spin. The coin’s value is between 0.01 and 2€. Its limited betting range makes it a suitable game for beginners or anyone who doesn't like to invest significant amounts of money.\n\nThe return to player (RTP) of this space-themed slot machine is more than satisfactory at 96.45%, perfectly in line with the other Tuko Productions slots.\n\nSymbols and Special Features\n\nThe gameplay of Tuko's slot games is always the same: win with alignments of identical symbols on adjacent reels, but starting from the left to the right. There is always a Wild symbol, a Scatter symbol, and often a Bonus that allows access to a mini-game.\n\n\"Alien Planets\" follows the same structure: symbols on the reels are represented by cute, funny-looking aliens and \"royals\" (playing cards from Jack to Ace). The Wild symbol is a colorful planet that has the function of a joker and can also create winning combinations on its own. The Scatter symbol is represented by multicolored crystals that give players free spins and multipliers when appearing at least three times on the reels, regardless of their position.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Alien Planets\" is a simple yet satisfying slot machine that guarantees a great gameplay experience. With its cuddly and adorable aliens, it brings a unique twist and adds fun to your online gaming sessions.\n        ",
