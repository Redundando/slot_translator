Nevertheless, it is well-maintained, making it ideal for those experienced gamers looking to focus purely on the game without distractions from flashy imagery. \n\nMain features of the slot\n\nGolden Knight is a slot game with a traditional game grid structure consisting of five reels, four rows, and 40 pay lines. Players win by obtaining combinations of identical symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the left to the right. The range of betting options offered by Golden Knight is one of its most interesting features. Although the minimum bet is a mere 1 cent per line, totaling to 40 cents, the maximum bet goes up to a breathtaking 800€, perfect for gamers looking to get their heart pumping with thrilling high-stakes bets.\n\nUnfortunately, the downside to this slot game is its return to player rate (RTP), which stands at a meager 95%, below average and quite low for a game where you can invest up to 800€.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Golden Knight\n\nThe symbols on the reels of Golden Knight include both thematic and non-themed symbols, with the thematic ones having the highest value, as is customary in slot games. The lower-paying symbols are represented by the numbers and letters corresponding to playing cards, ranging from 9 to Ace. To obtain higher winnings, players need to hope that the princess, horse, and fire-breathing dragon appear on the reels. \n\nThere is a Wild symbol identified simply by the corresponding label, which serves as a wild card and helps complete winning combinations to obtain a payout.

The story takes place during the Middle Ages, and the characters are those of classical medieval iconography, including a fearless knight, a beautiful princess waiting to be rescued, an array of shiny swords, a fire-breathing dragon, and, of course, horses.\n\nThe initial screen portrays a handsome knight (resembling more of a prince charming from Cinderella) brandishing a sword, while the game grid is placed in a rural landscape, with castles in the horizon and the reels placed simply within a golden grid. \n\nThe graphical aspect of Golden Knight is nothing spectacular, lacking three-dimensional animations and special effects. Nevertheless, it is well-maintained, making it ideal for those experienced gamers looking to focus purely on the game without distractions from flashy imagery. \n\nMain features of the slot\n\nGolden Knight is a slot game with a traditional game grid structure consisting of five reels, four rows, and 40 pay lines. Players win by obtaining combinations of identical symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the left to the right. The range of betting options offered by Golden Knight is one of its most interesting features. Although the minimum bet is a mere 1 cent per line, totaling to 40 cents, the maximum bet goes up to a breathtaking 800€, perfect for gamers looking to get their heart pumping with thrilling high-stakes bets.\n\nUnfortunately, the downside to this slot game is its return to player rate (RTP), which stands at a meager 95%, below average and quite low for a game where you can invest up to 800€.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Golden Knight\n\nThe symbols on the reels of Golden Knight include both thematic and non-themed symbols, with the thematic ones having the highest value, as is customary in slot games. The lower-paying symbols are represented by the numbers and letters corresponding to playing cards, ranging from 9 to Ace. To obtain higher winnings, players need to hope that the princess, horse, and fire-breathing dragon appear on the reels. \n\nThere is a Wild symbol identified simply by the corresponding label, which serves as a wild card and helps complete winning combinations to obtain a payout. Additionally, there is a Scatter symbol represented by the label 'Free Games,' which unlocks the Free Spins function when it appears on the three central reels. Players begin with 7 free spins and can reactivate them up to a maximum of 98. Finally, there is the special Scatter Bucks feature, which can be activated by playing on all 40 pay lines in conjunction with the 40 pay lines of the free spins. \n\nAll in all, Golden Knight is a medieval-themed slot game that could be exciting for experienced gamblers, with its ability to allow high-stakes betting and its potentially thrilling features.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics and structure\n\nGolden Knight features a traditional five-reel, four-row game grid structure with 40 pay lines. Players have to aim for combinations of identical symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the left to the right, to win. The game mechanics are easy to understand, making it accessible for beginners, but advanced players may find it too simple.\n\nBetting options and accessibility\n\nThe range of betting options in Golden Knight is its most intriguing feature ranging from a minimum of €0.40 cents (1 cent per line) to a maximum of €800. The game is accessible to all kinds of players — beginners as well as seasoned gamers can enjoy the game, due to the blend of low and high-stake betting options.\n\nSpecial features and bonus rounds\n\nGolden Knight comes with exciting and potentially rewarding special features. The game features a wild symbol (labelled simply as “wild”) that helps complete winning combinations for a payout. The scatter symbol is represented by the label 'Free Games,' which activates the Free Spins feature when it appears on three central reels. Players begin the bonus round with seven free spins, which can be reactivated to get up to 98 free spins. There is also a special Scatter Bucks feature that is activated by playing on all 40 pay lines and the 40 pay lines of the free spins.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nGolden Knight's graphics are well-maintained and adequately depict the medieval theme through classical medieval iconography of knights, princesses, swords, dragons, and horses. However, the graphics lack three-dimensional animations and special effects, making the game unappealing to gamers looking for a visually stunning experience.\n\nReturn to Player percentage (RTP)\n\nGolden Knight has a meager return to player rate (RTP) of 95%, which is below average, making the game less favorable for players. The chances of obtaining a payout for the amount of betting options it presents are quite low, and high-stake players are likely to be put off by the low RTP.\n\n        \n            ",

The objective is to obtain combinations of the same symbols from left to right across adjacent reels. The graphics and animations are simple and straightforward, with a medieval theme and a golden grid background.\n\nBetting options and accessibility\n\nPlayers can bet a minimum of 1 cent per line, for a total of 40 cents per spin. The maximum bet is 800€, making it a high-stakes option for those looking for a thrilling experience. Unfortunately, the return to player rate is 95%, which is below average, and may not be attractive to many players.\n\nFree Spins function and Scatter Bucks feature\n\nPlayers can unlock 7 free spins by finding the 'Free Games' Scatter symbol on the three middle reels. Players can reactivate free spins up to a maximum of 98. Additionally, the game includes a Scatter Bucks feature, which can be activated by playing on all 40 pay lines in conjunction with the free spins feature.\n\nGraphics and visual effects\n\nGolden Knight has a medieval theme with a golden grid background and includes classical medieval icons such as knights, princesses, horses, swords, and dragons. Although there may be a lack of visual effects and three-dimensional animations, the graphics are well-maintained and suitable for players who want to stay focused on the game without being overwhelmed by flashy imagery.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP) percentage\n\nUnfortunately, the RTP percentage in Golden Knight is only 95%, which is below average, and may not be attractive to many players. This low percentage is surprising given the up to 800€ maximum bet allowed in the game.\n\n        \n            ",

The story takes place during the Middle Ages, and the characters are those of classical medieval iconography, including a fearless knight, a beautiful princess waiting to be rescued, an array of shiny swords, a fire-breathing dragon, and, of course, horses.\n\nThe initial screen portrays a handsome knight (resembling more of a prince charming from Cinderella) brandishing a sword, while the game grid is placed in a rural landscape, with castles in the horizon and the reels placed simply within a golden grid. \n\nThe graphical aspect of Golden Knight is nothing spectacular, lacking three-dimensional animations and special effects. Nevertheless, it is well-maintained, making it ideal for those experienced gamers looking to focus purely on the game without distractions from flashy imagery. \n\nMain features of the slot\n\nGolden Knight is a slot game with a traditional game grid structure consisting of five reels, four rows, and 40 pay lines. Players win by obtaining combinations of identical symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the left to the right. The range of betting options offered by Golden Knight is one of its most interesting features. Although the minimum bet is a mere 1 cent per line, totaling to 40 cents, the maximum bet goes up to a breathtaking 800€, perfect for gamers looking to get their heart pumping with thrilling high-stakes bets.\n\nUnfortunately, the downside to this slot game is its return to player rate (RTP), which stands at a meager 95%, below average and quite low for a game where you can invest up to 800€.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Golden Knight\n\nThe symbols on the reels of Golden Knight include both thematic and non-themed symbols, with the thematic ones having the highest value, as is customary in slot games. The lower-paying symbols are represented by the numbers and letters corresponding to playing cards, ranging from 9 to Ace. To obtain higher winnings, players need to hope that the princess, horse, and fire-breathing dragon appear on the reels. \n\nThere is a Wild symbol identified simply by the corresponding label, which serves as a wild card and helps complete winning combinations to obtain a payout. Additionally, there is a Scatter symbol represented by the label 'Free Games,' which unlocks the Free Spins function when it appears on the three central reels. Players begin with 7 free spins and can reactivate them up to a maximum of 98. Finally, there is the special Scatter Bucks feature, which can be activated by playing on all 40 pay lines in conjunction with the 40 pay lines of the free spins. \n\nAll in all, Golden Knight is a medieval-themed slot game that could be exciting for experienced gamblers, with its ability to allow high-stakes betting and its potentially thrilling features.\n            ",

The story takes place during the Middle Ages, and the characters are those of classical medieval iconography, including a fearless knight, a beautiful princess waiting to be rescued, an array of shiny swords, a fire-breathing dragon, and, of course, horses.\n\nThe initial screen portrays a handsome knight (resembling more of a prince charming from Cinderella) brandishing a sword, while the game grid is placed in a rural landscape, with castles in the horizon and the reels placed simply within a golden grid. \n\nThe graphical aspect of Golden Knight is nothing spectacular, lacking three-dimensional animations and special effects. Nevertheless, it is well-maintained, making it ideal for those experienced gamers looking to focus purely on the game without distractions from flashy imagery. \n\nMain features of the slot\n\nGolden Knight is a slot game with a traditional game grid structure consisting of five reels, four rows, and 40 pay lines. Players win by obtaining combinations of identical symbols on adjacent reels, starting from the left to the right. The range of betting options offered by Golden Knight is one of its most interesting features. Although the minimum bet is a mere 1 cent per line, totaling to 40 cents, the maximum bet goes up to a breathtaking 800€, perfect for gamers looking to get their heart pumping with thrilling high-stakes bets.\n\nUnfortunately, the downside to this slot game is its return to player rate (RTP), which stands at a meager 95%, below average and quite low for a game where you can invest up to 800€.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Golden Knight\n\nThe symbols on the reels of Golden Knight include both thematic and non-themed symbols, with the thematic ones having the highest value, as is customary in slot games. The lower-paying symbols are represented by the numbers and letters corresponding to playing cards, ranging from 9 to Ace. To obtain higher winnings, players need to hope that the princess, horse, and fire-breathing dragon appear on the reels. \n\nThere is a Wild symbol identified simply by the corresponding label, which serves as a wild card and helps complete winning combinations to obtain a payout. Additionally, there is a Scatter symbol represented by the label 'Free Games,' which unlocks the Free Spins function when it appears on the three central reels. Players begin with 7 free spins and can reactivate them up to a maximum of 98. Finally, there is the special Scatter Bucks feature, which can be activated by playing on all 40 pay lines in conjunction with the 40 pay lines of the free spins. \n\nAll in all, Golden Knight is a medieval-themed slot game that could be exciting for experienced gamblers, with its ability to allow high-stakes betting and its potentially thrilling features.\n        ",
