Il layout non è standard, presenta una griglia cinque per quattro, il che significa che 20 simboli appaiono sui rulli durante un giro.\nCi sono 40 linee di pagamento, ma non è necessario attivarle tutte, in quanto avete la possibilità di abbassare il numero di linee di pagamento attive e giocare con meno, ma tenete a mente che in questo caso, una combinazione vincente non sarà innescata se più simboli uguali appaiono su una linea di pagamento che è stata disattivata.\n\n        ",

Each Pot of Gold on the screen will reveal an extra cash reward, with an added multiplier for an extra-large prize.\n\nThe game's logo is a Scatter, which can trigger cash wins regardless of alignment. Additionally, two or more logos will start the Luck or the Irish bonus re-spin. The Scatters will remain in place as the reels spin once again, for free. With three or more Scatters, the Legendary Songs function begins. You'll receive up to 15 Free Spins with extra Wilds. The Leprechaun symbols trigger two extra free games each at the end of your turn.\n\nEven the standard card symbols used in Leprechaun Legends (from 9 to Ace) have received a beautiful Gaelic touch, and even if they are not the symbols that pay the most, they will help you along the way. Winning combinations will pay up to €2.50 (based on a minimum bet of €0.50). The highest paying symbols are the members of the Irish band, each with their own instrument; a drum, a violin, an accordion, and a guitar.

Genesis takes you to the land of the little people in Ireland where 50 paylines await to reward you. The famous Ceilidh dance is in full swing and the violin, accordion, and drum will all reward you. The clovers are wild as always!\n\nWe all need a little luck when it comes to playing free slots, and with the luck of the Irish on your side in Leprechaun Legends, there could be a pot of gold waiting for you at the end of the rainbow! Set in the idyllic landscape of Ireland The Genesis game is available on desktop, mobile, and tablet, and provides bonuses that will make you dance an Irish jig. All 50 paylines are fixed, but you can customize your bet from € 0.01 per line to € 10.00, creating minimum bets of € 0.50 and maximum bets of € 500.00.\n\nFor Irish theme lovers\n\nLeprechaun Legends is based on stunning graphics to attract players into its universe, and we must say that the result is really quite impressive. The reels are entirely transparent, with symbols that seem to float in the air, which in turn allows players to admire the entire scenario that extends in the background: a clearing in the forest, illuminated by some sunbeams that penetrate through the foliage.\n\nAdd some funny sound effects and a background music in levare, inspired by Irish folk, and you'll have a memorable slot game universe. Now that the scene is set, let's take a look at the gameplay itself.\n\nExperience a new world in the clearing of an Irish forest struck by parsimonious sunbeams and wandering mist. The slot symbols float above the scene, making your view of sparkling clover, glowing letters and singing fairies impeccable. The stunning graphics are set to magical sound effects that add to the fun Irish-inspired background music. Immerse yourself in a universe you won't want to leave!\n\nIf you're looking to win big, there are some symbols you'll love. There are four different fairies, each playing a different instrument, that will trigger big wins. The clover is a wild symbol, which means it can replace any symbol.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of slot machines\n\nLeprechaun Legends includes a wide range of bonus features that can exponentially increase your chances of hitting the jackpot.\n\nThe Four-Leaf Clover is a wild card in the game, able to replace any of the symbols listed above. A welcome help when you are missing only one icon to form the combination you were aiming for.\n\nA Rainbow icon on Reel 1, accompanied by one or more Pot of Gold on Reels 2 to 5, activates the Pot of Gold Bonus round. Each Pot of Gold on the screen will reveal an extra cash reward, with an added multiplier for an extra-large prize.\n\nThe game's logo is a Scatter, which can trigger cash wins regardless of alignment. Additionally, two or more logos will start the Luck or the Irish bonus re-spin. The Scatters will remain in place as the reels spin once again, for free. With three or more Scatters, the Legendary Songs function begins. You'll receive up to 15 Free Spins with extra Wilds. The Leprechaun symbols trigger two extra free games each at the end of your turn.\n\nEven the standard card symbols used in Leprechaun Legends (from 9 to Ace) have received a beautiful Gaelic touch, and even if they are not the symbols that pay the most, they will help you along the way. Winning combinations will pay up to €2.50 (based on a minimum bet of €0.50). The highest paying symbols are the members of the Irish band, each with their own instrument; a drum, a violin, an accordion, and a guitar. Their soft tones can be heard in the background of this game, adding to the Irish folklore-inspired theme.\n\nIf the fairies appear on your reels, they'll bring some luck with them as they all offer the same payouts, €0.20, €1.50, and €5.00 for 3, 4, or 5 of them, respectively (based on the minimum bet of €0.50). To help create winning combinations, the lucky golden four-leaf clover (decorated with gems) is your wild icon, which replaces all other symbols, except for the scatter.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nLuck O The Irish is a mobile-friendly online slot, developed using HTML5 technology, which means it can be played on almost any smartphone or tablet. The layout is not standard, featuring a five by four grid, which means 20 symbols appear on the reels during a spin. There are 40 paylines, but it is not necessary to activate them all, as you have the option to lower the number of active paylines and play with fewer, but keep in mind that in this case, a winning combination will not be triggered if more identical symbols appear on a payline that has been deactivated.\n            ",

The game is set in the picturesque Irish countryside and features a range of symbols that include playing cards, fairies, pots of gold, and four band members playing their respective instruments. The game is packed with exciting bonus features, including wilds, scatters, the Pot of Gold Bonus round, and free spins.\n\nBet range and paylines\n\nLeprechaun Legends offers fixed 50 paylines, but players can customize their bets by adjusting the bet level and coin value. The bet level ranges from €0.01 to €10, while the coin value ranges from €0.01 to €0.20. This allows for minimum bets of €0.50 and maximum bets of €500.\n\nGraphics and sound\n\nLeprechaun Legends features stunning graphics and an immersive soundtrack that transports players to the heart of the Irish countryside.

Landing a wild symbol on the reels increases the chances of getting a winning combination.\n\nPot of Gold Bonus round\n\nLanding a rainbow symbol on reel 1 and one or more pot of gold symbols on reels 2-5 triggers the Pot of Gold Bonus round.

Players can win up to 5000 times their initial bet during the Pot of Gold Bonus round.\n\nFree spins with extra wilds\n\nLeprechaun Legends offers free spins with extra wilds when three or more scatter symbols, represented by the game's logo, appear on the reels. Players can receive up to 15 free spins with extra wilds during this round. The Leprechaun symbol triggers two extra free games each time it appears on the reels.

Genesis takes you to the land of the little people in Ireland where 50 paylines await to reward you. The famous Ceilidh dance is in full swing and the violin, accordion, and drum will all reward you. The clovers are wild as always!\n\nWe all need a little luck when it comes to playing free slots, and with the luck of the Irish on your side in Leprechaun Legends, there could be a pot of gold waiting for you at the end of the rainbow! Set in the idyllic landscape of Ireland The Genesis game is available on desktop, mobile, and tablet, and provides bonuses that will make you dance an Irish jig. All 50 paylines are fixed, but you can customize your bet from € 0.01 per line to € 10.00, creating minimum bets of € 0.50 and maximum bets of € 500.00.\n\nFor Irish theme lovers\n\nLeprechaun Legends is based on stunning graphics to attract players into its universe, and we must say that the result is really quite impressive. The reels are entirely transparent, with symbols that seem to float in the air, which in turn allows players to admire the entire scenario that extends in the background: a clearing in the forest, illuminated by some sunbeams that penetrate through the foliage.\n\nAdd some funny sound effects and a background music in levare, inspired by Irish folk, and you'll have a memorable slot game universe. Now that the scene is set, let's take a look at the gameplay itself.\n\nExperience a new world in the clearing of an Irish forest struck by parsimonious sunbeams and wandering mist. The slot symbols float above the scene, making your view of sparkling clover, glowing letters and singing fairies impeccable. The stunning graphics are set to magical sound effects that add to the fun Irish-inspired background music. Immerse yourself in a universe you won't want to leave!\n\nIf you're looking to win big, there are some symbols you'll love. There are four different fairies, each playing a different instrument, that will trigger big wins. The clover is a wild symbol, which means it can replace any symbol.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of slot machines\n\nLeprechaun Legends includes a wide range of bonus features that can exponentially increase your chances of hitting the jackpot.\n\nThe Four-Leaf Clover is a wild card in the game, able to replace any of the symbols listed above. A welcome help when you are missing only one icon to form the combination you were aiming for.\n\nA Rainbow icon on Reel 1, accompanied by one or more Pot of Gold on Reels 2 to 5, activates the Pot of Gold Bonus round. Each Pot of Gold on the screen will reveal an extra cash reward, with an added multiplier for an extra-large prize.\n\nThe game's logo is a Scatter, which can trigger cash wins regardless of alignment. Additionally, two or more logos will start the Luck or the Irish bonus re-spin. The Scatters will remain in place as the reels spin once again, for free. With three or more Scatters, the Legendary Songs function begins. You'll receive up to 15 Free Spins with extra Wilds. The Leprechaun symbols trigger two extra free games each at the end of your turn.\n\nEven the standard card symbols used in Leprechaun Legends (from 9 to Ace) have received a beautiful Gaelic touch, and even if they are not the symbols that pay the most, they will help you along the way. Winning combinations will pay up to €2.50 (based on a minimum bet of €0.50). The highest paying symbols are the members of the Irish band, each with their own instrument; a drum, a violin, an accordion, and a guitar. Their soft tones can be heard in the background of this game, adding to the Irish folklore-inspired theme.\n\nIf the fairies appear on your reels, they'll bring some luck with them as they all offer the same payouts, €0.20, €1.50, and €5.00 for 3, 4, or 5 of them, respectively (based on the minimum bet of €0.50). To help create winning combinations, the lucky golden four-leaf clover (decorated with gems) is your wild icon, which replaces all other symbols, except for the scatter.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nLuck O The Irish is a mobile-friendly online slot, developed using HTML5 technology, which means it can be played on almost any smartphone or tablet. The layout is not standard, featuring a five by four grid, which means 20 symbols appear on the reels during a spin. There are 40 paylines, but it is not necessary to activate them all, as you have the option to lower the number of active paylines and play with fewer, but keep in mind that in this case, a winning combination will not be triggered if more identical symbols appear on a payline that has been deactivated.\n            ",

The clover is a wild symbol, which means it can replace any symbol.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of slot machines\n\nLeprechaun Legends includes a wide range of bonus features that can exponentially increase your chances of hitting the jackpot.\n\nThe Four-Leaf Clover is a wild card in the game, able to replace any of the symbols listed above. A welcome help when you are missing only one icon to form the combination you were aiming for.\n\nA Rainbow icon on Reel 1, accompanied by one or more Pot of Gold on Reels 2 to 5, activates the Pot of Gold Bonus round. Each Pot of Gold on the screen will reveal an extra cash reward, with an added multiplier for an extra-large prize.\n\nThe game's logo is a Scatter, which can trigger cash wins regardless of alignment. Additionally, two or more logos will start the Luck or the Irish bonus re-spin. The Scatters will remain in place as the reels spin once again, for free. With three or more Scatters, the Legendary Songs function begins. You'll receive up to 15 Free Spins with extra Wilds. The Leprechaun symbols trigger two extra free games each at the end of your turn.\n\nEven the standard card symbols used in Leprechaun Legends (from 9 to Ace) have received a beautiful Gaelic touch, and even if they are not the symbols that pay the most, they will help you along the way. Winning combinations will pay up to €2.50 (based on a minimum bet of €0.50). The highest paying symbols are the members of the Irish band, each with their own instrument; a drum, a violin, an accordion, and a guitar. Their soft tones can be heard in the background of this game, adding to the Irish folklore-inspired theme.\n\nIf the fairies appear on your reels, they'll bring some luck with them as they all offer the same payouts, €0.20, €1.50, and €5.00 for 3, 4, or 5 of them, respectively (based on the minimum bet of €0.50). To help create winning combinations, the lucky golden four-leaf clover (decorated with gems) is your wild icon, which replaces all other symbols, except for the scatter.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nLuck O The Irish is a mobile-friendly online slot, developed using HTML5 technology, which means it can be played on almost any smartphone or tablet. The layout is not standard, featuring a five by four grid, which means 20 symbols appear on the reels during a spin. There are 40 paylines, but it is not necessary to activate them all, as you have the option to lower the number of active paylines and play with fewer, but keep in mind that in this case, a winning combination will not be triggered if more identical symbols appear on a payline that has been deactivated.\n        ",
