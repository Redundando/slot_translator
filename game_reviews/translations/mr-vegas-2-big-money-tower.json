Don't be swayed by the \"2\" in the title; this isn't a sequel but a revamp of a slot that was first released in 2012. The upgrades are evident, especially in the graphics department. As soon as the game begins, players are presented with a massive colonnade that could double as the entrance to a grand casino. In the center is the reel, with Mr. Vegas flanked by two attractive ladies. The symbols are meticulously crafted, with animations that give the game a dynamic feel. The jazz soundtrack, played with real instruments, adds to the ambience and gets players in the gambling mood.\n\nFeatures of Mr. Vegas 2: Big Money Tower\n\nThe game grid is sizable, with 5 reels and 4 rows, and 60 paylines that can't be adjusted.

If players land five of these simultaneously, they pay out the same amount as Mr. Vegas. Landing 3 Scatters triggers the Pick Bonus round, where players are taken to a screen displaying three cards. Players must choose a card to win a variable number of free spins and a special Wild: stacked, expanding, or random. Additionally, a random mystery symbol will appear stacked on the reels.\n\nThe Pick Bonus function can be triggered by clicking the shopping cart button. Landing three Big Money Tower symbols activates another special feature - players are transported to a screen displaying bronze, silver, and gold ladders with various prizes on each step. Players must aim to hit the center of the screen with a coin to try and win the prizes indicated.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the maximum payout on Mr. Vegas 2: Big Money Tower?\n\nPlayers can win a maximum payout of 2,601x the bet in this slot.\n\nDoes Mr. Vegas 2: Big Money Tower work on all devices?\n\nYes, Mr. Vegas 2: Big Money Tower works on desktop PCs, tablets, and smartphones with any operating system (iOS, Android, etc.).\n\nWhere can I play Mr. Vegas 2: Big Money Tower?\n\nThis slot is available at all licensed AAMS online casinos.\n            ",

Don't be swayed by the \"2\" in the title; this isn't a sequel but a revamp of a slot that was first released in 2012. The upgrades are evident, especially in the graphics department. As soon as the game begins, players are presented with a massive colonnade that could double as the entrance to a grand casino. In the center is the reel, with Mr. Vegas flanked by two attractive ladies. The symbols are meticulously crafted, with animations that give the game a dynamic feel. The jazz soundtrack, played with real instruments, adds to the ambience and gets players in the gambling mood.\n\nFeatures of Mr. Vegas 2: Big Money Tower\n\nThe game grid is sizable, with 5 reels and 4 rows, and 60 paylines that can't be adjusted. The maximum payout is 2,601x the bet, with a minimum bet of 0.30 €. To win, players need to match 3-5 identical symbols on consecutive reels, beginning from the leftmost reel.\n\nAutoplay allows players to set a maximum of one hundred automatic spins, while Turbo speeds up the spin duration. Mr. Vegas 2: Big Money Tower is a high-volatility slot game, with an RTP of 96%.\n\nHow to Win\n\nThere are ten basic symbols that players can use to form winning combinations in addition to three special symbols. Heart, spade, and ace symbols are low-value, while the number 7, dice, chips, and diamonds pay out more. The payouts increase significantly when players land on the two ladies, though the highest-paying symbol is Mr. Vegas.\n\nThe roulette is the Wild and substitutes for all symbols except the special symbols. If players land five of these simultaneously, they pay out the same amount as Mr. Vegas. Landing 3 Scatters triggers the Pick Bonus round, where players are taken to a screen displaying three cards. Players must choose a card to win a variable number of free spins and a special Wild: stacked, expanding, or random. Additionally, a random mystery symbol will appear stacked on the reels.\n\nThe Pick Bonus function can be triggered by clicking the shopping cart button. Landing three Big Money Tower symbols activates another special feature - players are transported to a screen displaying bronze, silver, and gold ladders with various prizes on each step. Players must aim to hit the center of the screen with a coin to try and win the prizes indicated.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the maximum payout on Mr. Vegas 2: Big Money Tower?\n\nPlayers can win a maximum payout of 2,601x the bet in this slot.\n\nDoes Mr. Vegas 2: Big Money Tower work on all devices?\n\nYes, Mr. Vegas 2: Big Money Tower works on desktop PCs, tablets, and smartphones with any operating system (iOS, Android, etc.).\n\nWhere can I play Mr. Vegas 2: Big Money Tower?\n\nThis slot is available at all licensed AAMS online casinos.\n            ",
