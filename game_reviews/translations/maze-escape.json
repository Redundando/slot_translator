To activate them, open the Athena or Minotaur blocks.\n\nWhen the Guidance of Athena feature is randomly activated, between 1 and 4 Path symbols are added to empty positions on the grid, increasing your chances of creating a new winning combination.\n\nWhen the Minotaur is unlocked, the Minotaur Wild feature is activated. The Minotaur fills the entire reel, turning it into a wild in the process. This stacked symbol also comes with an attached multiplier that can be anything up to 7x. Like other unblocked symbols, it moves one reel to the left with each Avalanche during the round.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to land more than one Minotaur, the Wild symbol, in the same winning combination, multiplier values are combined to give an even bigger win boost.\n\nLand 3 Bonus symbols in the same spin and you can expect 10 free spins in the Labyrinth Free Spins feature. Here, the Shifting Maze Avalanche is triggered after every winning free spin, not just on those that include the highlighted symbol position.\n\nBlocker symbols can appear on reels 3 to 6 during free spins. When these are unlocked, they can add another 1, 2, or 3 free spins to your total or they can award a boost of 1x, 2x, or 3x to the multiplier.\n\nFantasma Games has taken elements of the classic Megaways format and shaken them up to create something fresh and innovative.\n\nThe gameplay here is certainly unusual and we really recommend taking a demo spin if you have the opportunity, until you get used to the changing reels, blocks, and avalanches."

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame features (cascading reels, expanding wilds, special symbols)\nRTP and maximum prize\nGameplay (reels shifting, Shifting Maze Avalanche feature)\nLabyrinth Free Spins feature\nGraphics and sound\nInnovative take on Megaways format\nGreek mythology theme\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Maze Escape Megaways is an online slot developed by Fantasma. Features include cascading reels, expanding wilds, and free spins. This high-volatility slot has an RTP of 96.15% and a maximum prize of 25,000x.\n\nPlayers familiar with ancient Greece-themed slots will find an unusual gameplay in Maze Escape Megaways. Created by Fantasma Games, it is a 6-reel Megaways game where all reels move one step to the left when you activate the Shifting Maze Avalanche feature. Unlock special symbols to bring in more extras, including stacked wilds that come with random multipliers up to 7x attached. Activate the Labyrinth Free Spins feature and you'll play free spins with Shifting Maze Avalanches that trigger after every winning spin. Here, you could also get additional multipliers. Find out more in our in-depth review of Maze Escape Megaways.\n\nWith a powerful graphic like Zeus\n\nIn this online slot, the theme is based on Greek mythology - and Fantasma has really done its research to ensure the gameplay stays true to the legend of the Minotaur. It is based on the story of Daedalus, who designed a labyrinth to trap the Minotaur, but was also imprisoned in the maze.\n\nSymbols include Daedalus and his son Icarus, with the Minotaur playing a major role in the bonus features. Overall, it's a fantastic looking online slot and Fantasma has done an excellent job in creating a game inspired by mythology.\n\nThere is a sense of quality in the sound and images of the Maze Escape Megaways slot, which looks like the best animated film you've ever seen. With a theme dedicated to Ancient Greece, you'll see marble ruins in the background. In fact, it is set in a labyrinth which is a confusing structure whose function was to contain the monstrous Minotaur.\n\nThe cartoon-style images are bright, colorful, and well done. So is the overwhelming orchestral score, which has become fundamental for slots with this theme. It's catchy enough and certainly adds to the atmosphere. No complaints about the design of Maze Escape Megaways.\n\nThe reels consist of lower value Greek letter symbols, as well as laurel wreaths, helmets, coins, and axes, and a trio of higher-paying character symbols. The bearded Greek god tops the payouts, awarding 3x your total stake if you get 6 in combination.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nIn the central position on the leftmost reel, you'll see that one position is highlighted. If the symbol that appears in this position is part of a winning combination, it becomes the Path symbol and the Shifting Maze Avalanche feature is activated.\n\nAll Blocker and Minotaur symbols are locked, corresponding Path symbols are moved to the central position on their reel, and remaining symbols are removed. All reels then move one position to the left. Symbols on reel 1 fall off the screen and new symbols and blockers appear on reel 6.\n\nWith each shift, 2 random blockers are removed. A new win calculation is then made. If a new winner is formed, the process is repeated. This continues until there is an avalanche without a new winning combination on display. You can also activate a couple of modifiers during this feature. To activate them, open the Athena or Minotaur blocks.\n\nWhen the Guidance of Athena feature is randomly activated, between 1 and 4 Path symbols are added to empty positions on the grid, increasing your chances of creating a new winning combination.\n\nWhen the Minotaur is unlocked, the Minotaur Wild feature is activated. The Minotaur fills the entire reel, turning it into a wild in the process. This stacked symbol also comes with an attached multiplier that can be anything up to 7x. Like other unblocked symbols, it moves one reel to the left with each Avalanche during the round.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to land more than one Minotaur, the Wild symbol, in the same winning combination, multiplier values are combined to give an even bigger win boost.\n\nLand 3 Bonus symbols in the same spin and you can expect 10 free spins in the Labyrinth Free Spins feature. Here, the Shifting Maze Avalanche is triggered after every winning free spin, not just on those that include the highlighted symbol position.\n\nBlocker symbols can appear on reels 3 to 6 during free spins. When these are unlocked, they can add another 1, 2, or 3 free spins to your total or they can award a boost of 1x, 2x, or 3x to the multiplier.\n\nFantasma Games has taken elements of the classic Megaways format and shaken them up to create something fresh and innovative.\n\nThe gameplay here is certainly unusual and we really recommend taking a demo spin if you have the opportunity, until you get used to the changing reels, blocks, and avalanches.\n            ",

Features include cascading reels, expanding wilds, and free spins. This high-volatility slot has an RTP of 96.15% and a maximum prize of 25,000x.\n\nPlayers familiar with ancient Greece-themed slots will find an unusual gameplay in Maze Escape Megaways. Created by Fantasma Games, it is a 6-reel Megaways game where all reels move one step to the left when you activate the Shifting Maze Avalanche feature. Unlock special symbols to bring in more extras, including stacked wilds that come with random multipliers up to 7x attached. Activate the Labyrinth Free Spins feature and you'll play free spins with Shifting Maze Avalanches that trigger after every winning spin. Here, you could also get additional multipliers. Find out more in our in-depth review of Maze Escape Megaways.\n\nWith a powerful graphic like Zeus\n\nIn this online slot, the theme is based on Greek mythology - and Fantasma has really done its research to ensure the gameplay stays true to the legend of the Minotaur. It is based on the story of Daedalus, who designed a labyrinth to trap the Minotaur, but was also imprisoned in the maze.\n\nSymbols include Daedalus and his son Icarus, with the Minotaur playing a major role in the bonus features. Overall, it's a fantastic looking online slot and Fantasma has done an excellent job in creating a game inspired by mythology.\n\nThere is a sense of quality in the sound and images of the Maze Escape Megaways slot, which looks like the best animated film you've ever seen. With a theme dedicated to Ancient Greece, you'll see marble ruins in the background. In fact, it is set in a labyrinth which is a confusing structure whose function was to contain the monstrous Minotaur.\n\nThe cartoon-style images are bright, colorful, and well done. So is the overwhelming orchestral score, which has become fundamental for slots with this theme. It's catchy enough and certainly adds to the atmosphere. No complaints about the design of Maze Escape Megaways.\n\nThe reels consist of lower value Greek letter symbols, as well as laurel wreaths, helmets, coins, and axes, and a trio of higher-paying character symbols. The bearded Greek god tops the payouts, awarding 3x your total stake if you get 6 in combination.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nIn the central position on the leftmost reel, you'll see that one position is highlighted. If the symbol that appears in this position is part of a winning combination, it becomes the Path symbol and the Shifting Maze Avalanche feature is activated.\n\nAll Blocker and Minotaur symbols are locked, corresponding Path symbols are moved to the central position on their reel, and remaining symbols are removed. All reels then move one position to the left. Symbols on reel 1 fall off the screen and new symbols and blockers appear on reel 6.\n\nWith each shift, 2 random blockers are removed. A new win calculation is then made. If a new winner is formed, the process is repeated. This continues until there is an avalanche without a new winning combination on display. You can also activate a couple of modifiers during this feature. To activate them, open the Athena or Minotaur blocks.\n\nWhen the Guidance of Athena feature is randomly activated, between 1 and 4 Path symbols are added to empty positions on the grid, increasing your chances of creating a new winning combination.\n\nWhen the Minotaur is unlocked, the Minotaur Wild feature is activated. The Minotaur fills the entire reel, turning it into a wild in the process. This stacked symbol also comes with an attached multiplier that can be anything up to 7x. Like other unblocked symbols, it moves one reel to the left with each Avalanche during the round.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to land more than one Minotaur, the Wild symbol, in the same winning combination, multiplier values are combined to give an even bigger win boost.\n\nLand 3 Bonus symbols in the same spin and you can expect 10 free spins in the Labyrinth Free Spins feature. Here, the Shifting Maze Avalanche is triggered after every winning free spin, not just on those that include the highlighted symbol position.\n\nBlocker symbols can appear on reels 3 to 6 during free spins. When these are unlocked, they can add another 1, 2, or 3 free spins to your total or they can award a boost of 1x, 2x, or 3x to the multiplier.\n\nFantasma Games has taken elements of the classic Megaways format and shaken them up to create something fresh and innovative.\n\nThe gameplay here is certainly unusual and we really recommend taking a demo spin if you have the opportunity, until you get used to the changing reels, blocks, and avalanches.\n            ",

Overall, it's a fantastic looking online slot and Fantasma has done an excellent job in creating a game inspired by mythology.\n\nThere is a sense of quality in the sound and images of the Maze Escape Megaways slot, which looks like the best animated film you've ever seen. With a theme dedicated to Ancient Greece, you'll see marble ruins in the background. In fact, it is set in a labyrinth which is a confusing structure whose function was to contain the monstrous Minotaur.\n\nThe cartoon-style images are bright, colorful, and well done. So is the overwhelming orchestral score, which has become fundamental for slots with this theme. It's catchy enough and certainly adds to the atmosphere. No complaints about the design of Maze Escape Megaways.\n\nThe reels consist of lower value Greek letter symbols, as well as laurel wreaths, helmets, coins, and axes, and a trio of higher-paying character symbols. The bearded Greek god tops the payouts, awarding 3x your total stake if you get 6 in combination.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nIn the central position on the leftmost reel, you'll see that one position is highlighted. If the symbol that appears in this position is part of a winning combination, it becomes the Path symbol and the Shifting Maze Avalanche feature is activated.\n\nAll Blocker and Minotaur symbols are locked, corresponding Path symbols are moved to the central position on their reel, and remaining symbols are removed. All reels then move one position to the left. Symbols on reel 1 fall off the screen and new symbols and blockers appear on reel 6.\n\nWith each shift, 2 random blockers are removed. A new win calculation is then made. If a new winner is formed, the process is repeated. This continues until there is an avalanche without a new winning combination on display. You can also activate a couple of modifiers during this feature. To activate them, open the Athena or Minotaur blocks.\n\nWhen the Guidance of Athena feature is randomly activated, between 1 and 4 Path symbols are added to empty positions on the grid, increasing your chances of creating a new winning combination.\n\nWhen the Minotaur is unlocked, the Minotaur Wild feature is activated. The Minotaur fills the entire reel, turning it into a wild in the process. This stacked symbol also comes with an attached multiplier that can be anything up to 7x. Like other unblocked symbols, it moves one reel to the left with each Avalanche during the round.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to land more than one Minotaur, the Wild symbol, in the same winning combination, multiplier values are combined to give an even bigger win boost.\n\nLand 3 Bonus symbols in the same spin and you can expect 10 free spins in the Labyrinth Free Spins feature. Here, the Shifting Maze Avalanche is triggered after every winning free spin, not just on those that include the highlighted symbol position.\n\nBlocker symbols can appear on reels 3 to 6 during free spins. When these are unlocked, they can add another 1, 2, or 3 free spins to your total or they can award a boost of 1x, 2x, or 3x to the multiplier.\n\nFantasma Games has taken elements of the classic Megaways format and shaken them up to create something fresh and innovative.\n\nThe gameplay here is certainly unusual and we really recommend taking a demo spin if you have the opportunity, until you get used to the changing reels, blocks, and avalanches.\n            ",
