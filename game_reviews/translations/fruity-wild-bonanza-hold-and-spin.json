Keep reading this informative guide and try a spin in demo or with real money!\n\nHow to play Fruity Wild Bonanza Hold and Spin\nThis online video slot takes place on a 6x6 reel set and uses a scatter payout engine.

You can refer to the payout table to confirm all payment combinations along with their potential prizes. When you hit eight or more identical symbols simultaneously anywhere on the grid, you trigger a win.

Check out the next paragraph for more details.\n\nFruity Wild Bonanza Bonus Features\nAlthough there are many bonuses to activate in this game, most of the action takes place in the Hold & Spin mode.\n\nHold & Spin Game\n\nWhen more than 3 scatters land on the reels, this extra feature is activated. The game starts with three re-spins that reset every time a new icon is displayed. The symbols that can land in the feature include:\n\nThe prize symbols that reveal a bet multiplier.\nThe multiplier icons that multiply every active symbol except the Collector by x2, x3, x5, or x10;\nThe collector icons that add up the values ​​of all other symbols except Mini (30x), Minor (100x), and Major (500x) rewards.\n\nWhen all 36 grid positions are full, you receive the first prize of 1000 times the bet value, in addition to any other winnings. The feature ends after awarding the Grand Fruity Wild Bonanza Hold & Spin jackpot or when there are no more spins.\n\nPrizes\n\nReceive 3-6 prizes before the start of Hold & Spin. The rewards will be randomly assigned to the empty 6x6 matrix and depend on the number of scatters obtained in the base game to trigger the Fruity Wild Bonanza Hold & Spin bonus.\n\nSuper Bet (Super Stake)\n\nActivate the Super Bet to allow x2-x100 multiplier symbols to land in the base game. In addition, the feature increases your chances of activating Hold & Spin. The Super Stake doubles the bet.\n\nBuy Bonus\n\nOpen this feature and choose one of the five purchase options that cost between 100 and 250 times the bet amount. Then, you immediately enter the free Fruity Wild Bonanza Hold & Spin game mode.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow can I play Fruity Wild Bonanza Hold & Spin for free?\n\nPlaying slots for free is never a problem.
