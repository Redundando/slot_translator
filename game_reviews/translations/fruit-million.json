However, you can still access other settings by clicking on the gear button. The music is a fun tune that accompanies the spins, complemented by sound effects following winning combinations.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFruit Million's grid consists of 5 reels and 4 rows, with a stunning 100 pay lines to delve into! The game's default minimum bet is already set at €0.20 per spin but can be raised to a maximum of €15.

The color scheme of the game revolves around the luscious honey, with a yellow hue dominating the reels. The background consists of sunflowers and a jar of thick, inviting honey pouring down. On the left side of the grid lies a beehive, the little creatures' home and workplace.\n\nAs always, BGaming's game console features only a few buttons at the bottom of the grid, with options to increase the bet, Autoplay, and Start. However, you can still access other settings by clicking on the gear button. The music is a fun tune that accompanies the spins, complemented by sound effects following winning combinations.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFruit Million's grid consists of 5 reels and 4 rows, with a stunning 100 pay lines to delve into! The game's default minimum bet is already set at €0.20 per spin but can be raised to a maximum of €15. To win, you must form symbol combinations starting from the left reel and moving to the right.\n\nThe Quick Spin button speeds up the reel spins, and you can also set automatic spins. If you don't want to keep a constant watch over your game, you can set limits beyond which the Autoplay mode will stop. Fruit Million boasts an excellent RTP of 97.1%.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\n\nAs mentioned, Fruit Million merges different types of symbols. The low paying symbols consist of fruits: cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, grapes, and watermelon. The horseshoe has the same value as the watermelon, followed by the beehive with a higher value.\n\nMoving on to the special symbols, the Wild symbol in Fruit Million is the bee, acting as a substitute for all other symbols except the Scatter. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, and it has an expanding feature occupying the empty cells on the reel, increasing the chances of forming winning combinations.\n\nThere are two Scatters in the game: the first is the beehive, which is a Stacked Symbol that can expand to the right or left and remain fixed in the subsequent spins. The second Scatter is the diamond and pays regardless of pay lines.\n\nLastly, there's the Gamble feature, allowing you to increase your last win. After a winning combination, two symbols appear on the console - clicking on the dollar sign will collect the sum, while clicking on the playing cards means risking it all. A covered central card and two buttons, black and red, appear, prompting you to select one. The hope is that the card matches the color you selected. \n\nIn conclusion, Fruit Million is an engaging slot game with unique features and remarkable potential for big wins. Even experienced gamblers are bound to enjoy the game's fusion of classic fruit theme and busy bees.\n            ",

The color scheme of the game revolves around the luscious honey, with a yellow hue dominating the reels. The background consists of sunflowers and a jar of thick, inviting honey pouring down. On the left side of the grid lies a beehive, the little creatures' home and workplace.\n\nAs always, BGaming's game console features only a few buttons at the bottom of the grid, with options to increase the bet, Autoplay, and Start. However, you can still access other settings by clicking on the gear button. The music is a fun tune that accompanies the spins, complemented by sound effects following winning combinations.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFruit Million's grid consists of 5 reels and 4 rows, with a stunning 100 pay lines to delve into! The game's default minimum bet is already set at €0.20 per spin but can be raised to a maximum of €15. To win, you must form symbol combinations starting from the left reel and moving to the right.\n\nThe Quick Spin button speeds up the reel spins, and you can also set automatic spins. If you don't want to keep a constant watch over your game, you can set limits beyond which the Autoplay mode will stop. Fruit Million boasts an excellent RTP of 97.1%.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\n\nAs mentioned, Fruit Million merges different types of symbols. The low paying symbols consist of fruits: cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, grapes, and watermelon. The horseshoe has the same value as the watermelon, followed by the beehive with a higher value.\n\nMoving on to the special symbols, the Wild symbol in Fruit Million is the bee, acting as a substitute for all other symbols except the Scatter. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, and it has an expanding feature occupying the empty cells on the reel, increasing the chances of forming winning combinations.\n\nThere are two Scatters in the game: the first is the beehive, which is a Stacked Symbol that can expand to the right or left and remain fixed in the subsequent spins. The second Scatter is the diamond and pays regardless of pay lines.\n\nLastly, there's the Gamble feature, allowing you to increase your last win. After a winning combination, two symbols appear on the console - clicking on the dollar sign will collect the sum, while clicking on the playing cards means risking it all. A covered central card and two buttons, black and red, appear, prompting you to select one. The hope is that the card matches the color you selected. \n\nIn conclusion, Fruit Million is an engaging slot game with unique features and remarkable potential for big wins. Even experienced gamblers are bound to enjoy the game's fusion of classic fruit theme and busy bees.\n            ",

The color scheme of the game revolves around the luscious honey, with a yellow hue dominating the reels. The background consists of sunflowers and a jar of thick, inviting honey pouring down. On the left side of the grid lies a beehive, the little creatures' home and workplace.\n\nAs always, BGaming's game console features only a few buttons at the bottom of the grid, with options to increase the bet, Autoplay, and Start. However, you can still access other settings by clicking on the gear button. The music is a fun tune that accompanies the spins, complemented by sound effects following winning combinations.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFruit Million's grid consists of 5 reels and 4 rows, with a stunning 100 pay lines to delve into! The game's default minimum bet is already set at €0.20 per spin but can be raised to a maximum of €15. To win, you must form symbol combinations starting from the left reel and moving to the right.\n\nThe Quick Spin button speeds up the reel spins, and you can also set automatic spins. If you don't want to keep a constant watch over your game, you can set limits beyond which the Autoplay mode will stop. Fruit Million boasts an excellent RTP of 97.1%.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\n\nAs mentioned, Fruit Million merges different types of symbols. The low paying symbols consist of fruits: cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, grapes, and watermelon. The horseshoe has the same value as the watermelon, followed by the beehive with a higher value.\n\nMoving on to the special symbols, the Wild symbol in Fruit Million is the bee, acting as a substitute for all other symbols except the Scatter. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, and it has an expanding feature occupying the empty cells on the reel, increasing the chances of forming winning combinations.\n\nThere are two Scatters in the game: the first is the beehive, which is a Stacked Symbol that can expand to the right or left and remain fixed in the subsequent spins. The second Scatter is the diamond and pays regardless of pay lines.\n\nLastly, there's the Gamble feature, allowing you to increase your last win. After a winning combination, two symbols appear on the console - clicking on the dollar sign will collect the sum, while clicking on the playing cards means risking it all. A covered central card and two buttons, black and red, appear, prompting you to select one. The hope is that the card matches the color you selected. \n\nIn conclusion, Fruit Million is an engaging slot game with unique features and remarkable potential for big wins. Even experienced gamblers are bound to enjoy the game's fusion of classic fruit theme and busy bees.\n        ",
