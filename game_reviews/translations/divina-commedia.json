The game is set in Hell, where Dante enters in the first canto, and it features all of the main characters the poet meets during his journey, including Beatrice, his inspiring muse. However, Divina Commedia has a humorous twist to its storyline, with cartoonish graphics and funny animations that give the game a unique feel.\n\nReels, paylines, and betting options\n\nThe slot game comes with 5 reels and 3 rows that generate 30 fixed paylines. Players can bet from a minimum of 0.01 € per line, which results in a total bet of 0.30 € per Spin, up to a maximum of 1 € per line, which equals a total bet of 30 €. Users can also set between 5 and 50 automatic spins without limits on winnings or losses. The game has a low volatility and an RTP of 94.66%.\n\nSymbols and payouts\n\nAs expected, all symbols in Divina Commedia are related to the theme of the game. The least valuable symbols are the pitchfork and the Roman numerals representing canto VII, III, and I. The most valuable symbols are Cerberus, Lucifer, Beatrice, and Dante. The rewards range from 20 times the bet to 750. The Wild symbol is represented by a gold coin and pays out while replacing all symbols except the special ones. The Scatter symbol is Charon and offers 3 to 30 free spins, as well as a multiplier that goes up to x30. Players can also win one of the 4 jackpots available.\n\nBonus features\n\nDivina Commedia offers many bonus features that can increase the chances of winning big. The Free Spins feature is triggered by landing 3 Scatter symbols, and players can choose a heart from the 12 available ones before starting the spins. Behind them, additional free spins or multipliers hide. The Free Spins feature can also be re-triggered if additional Scatter symbols appear. The Bonus Game adds even more excitement to the game, and it is activated when players land the slot logo. In this feature, players can choose between the Jungle Bonus and the Throat Bonus, both providing different challenges. During the Jungle Bonus, players must collect coins to give Charon, while during the Throat Bonus, they need to grab candies without waking Cerberus.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nDivina Commedia is a slot game with low volatility and an RTP of 94.66%. Low volatility means that the game provides frequent small payouts, while the RTP indicates the percentage of all the wagered money that is paid back to the players over time, with the remaining percentage being the house edge.\n\n        \n            ",

In the field of literature, the work that represents us more than any other is undoubtedly The Divine Comedy by the supreme Dante. Giocaonline pays tribute to him with a fun slot set in Hell, where the first canto is set. However, it does so with a humorous twist, bringing in all the main characters the poet meets along his way, not forgetting Beatrice, his inspiring muse.\n\nThe graphics have a cartoonish style, with lots of funny animations and variations on the theme, such as Dante with sunglasses or Paolo and Francesca, the protagonists of the fifth canto, who send us a postcard from Rimini! The background behind the fiery game frame that drips lava is divided in half: on the left side is the dark forest where Dante is lost, on the right side is Hell itself. At the bottom, we can set our bet, here you will find the buttons to change the value of the bet, the one to set the maximum bet all at once, the Autoplay, and the Start button.\n\nSlot Features\nThe 5 reels and 3 rows generate 30 fixed paylines, where you can bet from a minimum of 0.01 € per line, for a total of 0.30 € per Spin, up to a maximum of 1 € with the overall bet reaching 30 €. You can set between 5 and 50 automatic spins without limits on winnings or losses. Low volatility and RTP of 94.66%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\nAs you can imagine, all symbols are theme-based. Those of lesser value are the pitchfork and the Roman numerals indicating canto VII, III and I. You level up with Cerberus, Lucifer, Beatrice, and finally Dante, with rewards ranging from 20 times the bet to 750!\n\nThe Wild symbol is the gold coin, and in addition to paying out, it replaces all symbols except the special ones. The Scatter symbol is represented by Charon and gives 3 to 30 free spins plus a multiplier that can reach x30. Before starting the Free Spins, we will be asked to select a heart from the 12 available ones, behind which additional free spins or multipliers hide.\n\nThe Free Spins also increase if additional Scatter symbols appear. An additional Bonus game is activated when we find the slot logo. In this case, we can choose between the Jungle Bonus and the Throat Bonus: in the first, we must collect coins to give to Charon, in the second, candies, being careful not to wake Cerberus. In Divina Commedia, you can also win one of the 4 jackpots available. \n\nExperience the thrill of the Divine Comedy and spin the reels to uncover the mysteries of Hell. It is time to join Dante on his journey and be rewarded generously. Are you ready to enter the inferno and emerge victorious? Play Divina Commedia now!\n            ",

In the field of literature, the work that represents us more than any other is undoubtedly The Divine Comedy by the supreme Dante. Giocaonline pays tribute to him with a fun slot set in Hell, where the first canto is set. However, it does so with a humorous twist, bringing in all the main characters the poet meets along his way, not forgetting Beatrice, his inspiring muse.\n\nThe graphics have a cartoonish style, with lots of funny animations and variations on the theme, such as Dante with sunglasses or Paolo and Francesca, the protagonists of the fifth canto, who send us a postcard from Rimini! The background behind the fiery game frame that drips lava is divided in half: on the left side is the dark forest where Dante is lost, on the right side is Hell itself. At the bottom, we can set our bet, here you will find the buttons to change the value of the bet, the one to set the maximum bet all at once, the Autoplay, and the Start button.\n\nSlot Features\nThe 5 reels and 3 rows generate 30 fixed paylines, where you can bet from a minimum of 0.01 € per line, for a total of 0.30 € per Spin, up to a maximum of 1 € with the overall bet reaching 30 €. You can set between 5 and 50 automatic spins without limits on winnings or losses. Low volatility and RTP of 94.66%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\nAs you can imagine, all symbols are theme-based. Those of lesser value are the pitchfork and the Roman numerals indicating canto VII, III and I. You level up with Cerberus, Lucifer, Beatrice, and finally Dante, with rewards ranging from 20 times the bet to 750!\n\nThe Wild symbol is the gold coin, and in addition to paying out, it replaces all symbols except the special ones. The Scatter symbol is represented by Charon and gives 3 to 30 free spins plus a multiplier that can reach x30. Before starting the Free Spins, we will be asked to select a heart from the 12 available ones, behind which additional free spins or multipliers hide.\n\nThe Free Spins also increase if additional Scatter symbols appear. An additional Bonus game is activated when we find the slot logo. In this case, we can choose between the Jungle Bonus and the Throat Bonus: in the first, we must collect coins to give to Charon, in the second, candies, being careful not to wake Cerberus. In Divina Commedia, you can also win one of the 4 jackpots available. \n\nExperience the thrill of the Divine Comedy and spin the reels to uncover the mysteries of Hell. It is time to join Dante on his journey and be rewarded generously. Are you ready to enter the inferno and emerge victorious? Play Divina Commedia now!\n            ",
