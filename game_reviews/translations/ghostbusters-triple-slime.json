Who could forget the famous line, \"Don't cross the streams\"? It's no surprise that this 80s cult classic has made its way into the world of slots. In fact, Ghostbusters Triple Slime is the slot game proposed by IGT and it's not even the first one on this theme, as IGT has also released the slot game simply called Ghostbusters.\n\nBut if it's important to know the technical aspects of a slot game, it's also important to review its aesthetic aspect, which is essential in making a slot game attractive. So, let's begin our review of Ghostbusters Triple Slime with the graphics!\n\nGhostbusters Triple Slime - The Aesthetic Aspect\n\nGhostbusters Triple Slime can be considered a tribute to the film itself. In fact, we are presented with the gaming grid, with the famous firehouse used as the Ghostbusters' headquarters in the background. The actual gaming grid is more carefully designed than the other Ghostbusters slot game, with small details like the green slime in the corners of the grid and the yellow and black striped pattern typical of the film.\n\nThe choice of symbols is particularly appropriate. We will find the four Ghostbusters on a colorful background, along with the crossed-out ghost symbol, the giant Marshmallow Man as the WILD symbol, and the film's objects: the proton pack, storage system, PKE meter, tech helmet, and even the ECTO-1 ambulance Cadillac. Meanwhile, Slimer's symbol will come to life during certain combinations. Each game is also accompanied by the Ghostbusters theme song with the famous line \"Who you gonna call?\". Although it doesn't stand out as much in terms of originality compared to the other Ghostbusters slot game, Ghostbusters Triple Slime is also aimed at fans of the film who won't be disappointed.\n\nNow let's talk about the technical features of Ghostbusters Triple Slime.\n\nGhostbusters Triple Slime - Simplicity and Originality\n\nWith its 96.08% RTP, this IGT slot game won't be long in rewarding the player with small and big prizes. We are faced with one of the winning formulas of this development company: instead of using the mechanism that has become famous thanks to online slot games, namely the five by three, the gaming grid expands towards the center of the slot and narrows towards the two extremes. As a result, the game is able to show 19 symbols per game and benefit from 720 paylines compared to the 20/30 normally found online.\n\nThe rather minimalist style of this game might require the player a bit of time to get comfortable with and understand all of its functions, so we recommend some caution in approaching this title for the first time.\n\nSlot Games Similar to Ghostbusters Triple Slime\n\nIf we look for games that reflect the canon imposed by this slot game, we don't have to go far: IGT itself offers another Ghostbusters-themed title with this specific name. In addition, Microgaming, NetEnt, and Playtech are renowned for their film-themed games, from King Kong to Jurassic Park, to satisfy all tastes and times.\n            ",

Who could forget the famous line, \"Don't cross the streams\"? It's no surprise that this 80s cult classic has made its way into the world of slots. In fact, Ghostbusters Triple Slime is the slot game proposed by IGT and it's not even the first one on this theme, as IGT has also released the slot game simply called Ghostbusters.\n\nBut if it's important to know the technical aspects of a slot game, it's also important to review its aesthetic aspect, which is essential in making a slot game attractive. So, let's begin our review of Ghostbusters Triple Slime with the graphics!\n\nGhostbusters Triple Slime - The Aesthetic Aspect\n\nGhostbusters Triple Slime can be considered a tribute to the film itself. In fact, we are presented with the gaming grid, with the famous firehouse used as the Ghostbusters' headquarters in the background. The actual gaming grid is more carefully designed than the other Ghostbusters slot game, with small details like the green slime in the corners of the grid and the yellow and black striped pattern typical of the film.\n\nThe choice of symbols is particularly appropriate. We will find the four Ghostbusters on a colorful background, along with the crossed-out ghost symbol, the giant Marshmallow Man as the WILD symbol, and the film's objects: the proton pack, storage system, PKE meter, tech helmet, and even the ECTO-1 ambulance Cadillac. Meanwhile, Slimer's symbol will come to life during certain combinations. Each game is also accompanied by the Ghostbusters theme song with the famous line \"Who you gonna call?\". Although it doesn't stand out as much in terms of originality compared to the other Ghostbusters slot game, Ghostbusters Triple Slime is also aimed at fans of the film who won't be disappointed.\n\nNow let's talk about the technical features of Ghostbusters Triple Slime.\n\nGhostbusters Triple Slime - Simplicity and Originality\n\nWith its 96.08% RTP, this IGT slot game won't be long in rewarding the player with small and big prizes. We are faced with one of the winning formulas of this development company: instead of using the mechanism that has become famous thanks to online slot games, namely the five by three, the gaming grid expands towards the center of the slot and narrows towards the two extremes. As a result, the game is able to show 19 symbols per game and benefit from 720 paylines compared to the 20/30 normally found online.\n\nThe rather minimalist style of this game might require the player a bit of time to get comfortable with and understand all of its functions, so we recommend some caution in approaching this title for the first time.\n\nSlot Games Similar to Ghostbusters Triple Slime\n\nIf we look for games that reflect the canon imposed by this slot game, we don't have to go far: IGT itself offers another Ghostbusters-themed title with this specific name. In addition, Microgaming, NetEnt, and Playtech are renowned for their film-themed games, from King Kong to Jurassic Park, to satisfy all tastes and times.\n            ",

Who could forget the famous line, \"Don't cross the streams\"? It's no surprise that this 80s cult classic has made its way into the world of slots. In fact, Ghostbusters Triple Slime is the slot game proposed by IGT and it's not even the first one on this theme, as IGT has also released the slot game simply called Ghostbusters.\n\nBut if it's important to know the technical aspects of a slot game, it's also important to review its aesthetic aspect, which is essential in making a slot game attractive. So, let's begin our review of Ghostbusters Triple Slime with the graphics!\n\nGhostbusters Triple Slime - The Aesthetic Aspect\n\nGhostbusters Triple Slime can be considered a tribute to the film itself. In fact, we are presented with the gaming grid, with the famous firehouse used as the Ghostbusters' headquarters in the background. The actual gaming grid is more carefully designed than the other Ghostbusters slot game, with small details like the green slime in the corners of the grid and the yellow and black striped pattern typical of the film.\n\nThe choice of symbols is particularly appropriate. We will find the four Ghostbusters on a colorful background, along with the crossed-out ghost symbol, the giant Marshmallow Man as the WILD symbol, and the film's objects: the proton pack, storage system, PKE meter, tech helmet, and even the ECTO-1 ambulance Cadillac. Meanwhile, Slimer's symbol will come to life during certain combinations. Each game is also accompanied by the Ghostbusters theme song with the famous line \"Who you gonna call?\". Although it doesn't stand out as much in terms of originality compared to the other Ghostbusters slot game, Ghostbusters Triple Slime is also aimed at fans of the film who won't be disappointed.\n\nNow let's talk about the technical features of Ghostbusters Triple Slime.\n\nGhostbusters Triple Slime - Simplicity and Originality\n\nWith its 96.08% RTP, this IGT slot game won't be long in rewarding the player with small and big prizes. We are faced with one of the winning formulas of this development company: instead of using the mechanism that has become famous thanks to online slot games, namely the five by three, the gaming grid expands towards the center of the slot and narrows towards the two extremes. As a result, the game is able to show 19 symbols per game and benefit from 720 paylines compared to the 20/30 normally found online.\n\nThe rather minimalist style of this game might require the player a bit of time to get comfortable with and understand all of its functions, so we recommend some caution in approaching this title for the first time.\n\nSlot Games Similar to Ghostbusters Triple Slime\n\nIf we look for games that reflect the canon imposed by this slot game, we don't have to go far: IGT itself offers another Ghostbusters-themed title with this specific name. In addition, Microgaming, NetEnt, and Playtech are renowned for their film-themed games, from King Kong to Jurassic Park, to satisfy all tastes and times.\n            ",
