After all, in many cultures this animal is associated with wealth: the dragon that guards the cave full of gold is also found in Tolkien's The Hobbit and now in Bally's Blazing X.\nIn this review, we will talk about the visual and sound aspects, as well as the gameplay mechanics of this oriental-flavored slot game.\n\nBlazing X - An Intense Soundtrack\nOne common characteristic of oriental-flavored slots is the atmosphere they create, which is meant to immerse us in the Chinese culture and surrounding countries with colors and shapes.\nBlazing X by Bally achieves this with an intense soundtrack that tends to change as we play, but still maintains the classic oriental motifs. The game grid only occupies about a third of the interface, developing into a perfect square (we will see later what this means), and on the background, we see embroidered flowers on what seems to be red velvet. Apart from the two dragons guarding the game grid, there's not much else to say, and we prefer to move on to the gameplay, which is more diverse.\n\nBlazing X - Gameplay Mechanics\nBlazing X is certainly not conditioned by market archetypes, as it identifies its own game style. The grid is a type of 5*5 (that's why it's a square), showing twenty-five symbols with each spin, ten more than the classic 5*3 grid type.\nThe RTP is 95.94%, which is average in the market, but it's the slot's operation and its special functions that make it more unique. During gameplay, we can obtain a Wild center reel, which is covered with Jolly symbols. This reel will also contain a multiplier (usually starting at 2x or 3x) and will give us 3 chances.\n\nWhat does it mean? After finding a Wild reel, we will have three spins to find another one: if we succeed in our mission, the multiplier will increase, reaching 5x, then 10x and finally 25x. The bonus feature is integrated in the same spins, and each of them has the potential to create a series of chain wins of exceptional value.\nIn addition, there's another special function, triggered by finding three dragons, which are Scatter symbols that allow us to obtain free spins with a multiplier that has unlimited possibilities.\n\nSlots Similar to Blazing X\nThe oriental theme is not uncommon in the online gaming industry, and it has been tackled in all its facets, even by Bally itself: we can find titles such as China River, Jewel of the Dragon (in case you have grown fond of this creature), or Fu Dao Le. Experienced gamblers will find Blazing X a fresh and exciting addition to their gaming portfolio, with its unique game mechanics and stunning visuals.\n            ",

The RTP is 95.94%, and the slot features a Wild center reel that is covered with Jolly symbols and contains a multiplier (starting at 2x or 3x) that gives players 3 chances. Additionally, finding three Scattered dragon symbols allows players to obtain free spins with an unlimited multiplier that can create a series of chain wins.\n\nBonus Features\n\nBlazing X features a Wild center reel with multipliers that increases up to 25x, with 3 chances to find another one. The slot also has a bonus feature triggered by finding three Scatter symbols, which award free spins with an unlimited multiplier. The bonus feature and the Wild center reel can create a series of chain wins of exceptional value.\n\nRTP\n\nBlazing X has an RTP of 95.94%, which is average in the market.\n\nSound Design\n\nBlazing X immerses players in Chinese culture with oriental motifs and an intense soundtrack that changes but maintains the classic oriental motifs. The game grid only occupies about a third of the interface, developing into a perfect square and on the background, is embroidered flowers on what seems to be red velvet.\n\nTheme\n\nBlazing X is an oriental-themed slot that features dragons as the main symbols associated with wealth in many cultures. The visual aspects are stunning, with an embroidered flower background on red velvet and two dragons guarding the game grid. It is a fresh and exciting addition to the gaming portfolio, with unique gameplay mechanics.\n\n        \n            ",

After all, in many cultures this animal is associated with wealth: the dragon that guards the cave full of gold is also found in Tolkien's The Hobbit and now in Bally's Blazing X.\nIn this review, we will talk about the visual and sound aspects, as well as the gameplay mechanics of this oriental-flavored slot game.\n\nBlazing X - An Intense Soundtrack\nOne common characteristic of oriental-flavored slots is the atmosphere they create, which is meant to immerse us in the Chinese culture and surrounding countries with colors and shapes.\nBlazing X by Bally achieves this with an intense soundtrack that tends to change as we play, but still maintains the classic oriental motifs. The game grid only occupies about a third of the interface, developing into a perfect square (we will see later what this means), and on the background, we see embroidered flowers on what seems to be red velvet. Apart from the two dragons guarding the game grid, there's not much else to say, and we prefer to move on to the gameplay, which is more diverse.\n\nBlazing X - Gameplay Mechanics\nBlazing X is certainly not conditioned by market archetypes, as it identifies its own game style. The grid is a type of 5*5 (that's why it's a square), showing twenty-five symbols with each spin, ten more than the classic 5*3 grid type.\nThe RTP is 95.94%, which is average in the market, but it's the slot's operation and its special functions that make it more unique. During gameplay, we can obtain a Wild center reel, which is covered with Jolly symbols. This reel will also contain a multiplier (usually starting at 2x or 3x) and will give us 3 chances.\n\nWhat does it mean? After finding a Wild reel, we will have three spins to find another one: if we succeed in our mission, the multiplier will increase, reaching 5x, then 10x and finally 25x. The bonus feature is integrated in the same spins, and each of them has the potential to create a series of chain wins of exceptional value.\nIn addition, there's another special function, triggered by finding three dragons, which are Scatter symbols that allow us to obtain free spins with a multiplier that has unlimited possibilities.\n\nSlots Similar to Blazing X\nThe oriental theme is not uncommon in the online gaming industry, and it has been tackled in all its facets, even by Bally itself: we can find titles such as China River, Jewel of the Dragon (in case you have grown fond of this creature), or Fu Dao Le. Experienced gamblers will find Blazing X a fresh and exciting addition to their gaming portfolio, with its unique game mechanics and stunning visuals.\n            ",

After all, in many cultures this animal is associated with wealth: the dragon that guards the cave full of gold is also found in Tolkien's The Hobbit and now in Bally's Blazing X.\nIn this review, we will talk about the visual and sound aspects, as well as the gameplay mechanics of this oriental-flavored slot game.\n\nBlazing X - An Intense Soundtrack\nOne common characteristic of oriental-flavored slots is the atmosphere they create, which is meant to immerse us in the Chinese culture and surrounding countries with colors and shapes.\nBlazing X by Bally achieves this with an intense soundtrack that tends to change as we play, but still maintains the classic oriental motifs. The game grid only occupies about a third of the interface, developing into a perfect square (we will see later what this means), and on the background, we see embroidered flowers on what seems to be red velvet. Apart from the two dragons guarding the game grid, there's not much else to say, and we prefer to move on to the gameplay, which is more diverse.\n\nBlazing X - Gameplay Mechanics\nBlazing X is certainly not conditioned by market archetypes, as it identifies its own game style. The grid is a type of 5*5 (that's why it's a square), showing twenty-five symbols with each spin, ten more than the classic 5*3 grid type.\nThe RTP is 95.94%, which is average in the market, but it's the slot's operation and its special functions that make it more unique. During gameplay, we can obtain a Wild center reel, which is covered with Jolly symbols. This reel will also contain a multiplier (usually starting at 2x or 3x) and will give us 3 chances.\n\nWhat does it mean? After finding a Wild reel, we will have three spins to find another one: if we succeed in our mission, the multiplier will increase, reaching 5x, then 10x and finally 25x. The bonus feature is integrated in the same spins, and each of them has the potential to create a series of chain wins of exceptional value.\nIn addition, there's another special function, triggered by finding three dragons, which are Scatter symbols that allow us to obtain free spins with a multiplier that has unlimited possibilities.\n\nSlots Similar to Blazing X\nThe oriental theme is not uncommon in the online gaming industry, and it has been tackled in all its facets, even by Bally itself: we can find titles such as China River, Jewel of the Dragon (in case you have grown fond of this creature), or Fu Dao Le. Experienced gamblers will find Blazing X a fresh and exciting addition to their gaming portfolio, with its unique game mechanics and stunning visuals.\n        ",
