While the first episode in the series, John Hunter and the Da Vinci's Treasure, caused quite a stir due to the unreachable jackpot promised, equal to 48,000 times the bet, this slot has received less enthusiastic comments due to the fact that it is, according to many, a sort of mix between the famous slot Montezuma's Treasure from Interactive and a kind of artisanal prototype present on the Megaways engine.\nThe theme of the game is not new in the world of slot machines: several developers have proposed sagas dedicated to the figure of an explorer in their catalogs, including Rich Wilde from Play'n Go and the Book of the Dead series from Novomatic.\nIn John Hunter and the Aztec Treasure, we are immersed in the ancient Aztec culture, with typical South American scenarios and engaging graphics that highlight the adventurous nature of the game.\nYou can bet on this slot up to €100, but you can also play in the \"play for fun\" mode, without real money, offered by several online casinos. The RTP is 96.5% while the volatility is high, which means that you can get significant winnings but not with great frequency.\nSymbols, Wilds and Scatters\nAn Aztec pyramid illuminated by torches serves as a backdrop to the symbols that alternate on the reels: a torch, a hat, a toucan, a snake, a panther and of course the explorer John Hunter.\nThe Wild symbol is represented by a mask that reproduces a totem: it can only appear on reels 2, 3 and 4 and replaces all other symbols, except the Scatter.\nThe Scatter symbol is an ancient sundial and when it appears on the reels, it activates the Free Spins mode, with a number of free spins ranging from 5 to 25. During Free Spins, all winnings will be multiplied from 2 to 20 times, and if the Scatter appears again, additional free spins can be added to those already obtained.\nSlots similar to John Hunter and the Aztec Treasure\nIf you loved this chapter of explorer Hunter's saga, you should try the other two slots: John Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen and John Hunter and the Da Vinci's Treasure. If instead, you are captivated by the historical theme related to the ancient Aztec culture, between ancient times and suggestive totems, we suggest you take a look at Montezuma's Treasure from Interactive, Aztec Princess and Aztec Idols from the software house Play'n Go, and Amazing Aztecs from the provider JFTW.\n        ",
