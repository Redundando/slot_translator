Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Features\n\nMystery Reels is a free online slot game with 7 reels, 6 rows, and 30 fixed paylines. Combining symbols on the reels from both sides can lead to big wins ranging from a minimum bet of €0.10 up to a maximum of €100 per spin. With an RTP of around 95.67%, this high-volatility game offers a modern twist on a classic fruit machine theme.\n\nSymbols and Special Features\n\n The slot game features 4 standard icons (cherries, oranges, lemons, and plums) and 4 premium ones (watermelons, bells, grapes, and 7s) enhanced by special features and symbols. Look out for the Mystery Symbol, represented by a golden apple with a question mark in the middle, which can be activated in two ways. It can be triggered randomly during any spin, or when you land the symbol on the reels. Up to 3 mystery symbols can appear on a single spin, which then combine to create the potential for big wins. Each mystery symbol has the potential to be cloned 1, 2, or 3 times, expanding onto adjacent tiles. Once the process is complete, the golden apple may reward you with a maximum payout of 5000 times your bet.\n\nJackpots\n\nThere are 2 Progressive Jackpots available in this game - the Daily Drop and the Super Drop - that you can win by landing three jackpot symbols on the reels during any spin. The Super Drop is unlimited, while the Daily Drop can be won on a daily basis within a limited time frame. The amount you can win is proportional to your bet amount.\n\nWild Symbol\n\nThe sparkling Diamond serves as the Wild symbol, substituting for any other symbol on the reels. Landing 7 diamonds on the reels results in a 175x multiplier of your bet.\n\nBetting Options\n\nMystery Reels offers a variety of betting options, ranging from €0.10 up to a maximum of €100 per spin. Players can choose the bet amount using the + and - buttons located on the game screen. This allows for flexibility and customisation depending on the individual player's preferences and budget.\n\n        \n            ",

Combining symbols on the reels from both sides can lead to big wins ranging from a minimum bet of €0.10 up to a maximum of €100 per spin.\n\nWith an RTP of around 95.67%, this high-volatility game offers a modern twist on a classic fruit machine theme, with 4 standard icons (cherries, oranges, lemons, and plums) and 4 premium ones (watermelons, bells, grapes, and 7s) enhanced by special features and symbols.\n\nLook out for the Mystery Symbol, represented by a golden apple with a question mark in the middle, which can be activated in two ways. It can be triggered randomly during any spin, or when you land the symbol on the reels. Up to 3 mystery symbols can appear on a single spin, which then combine to create the potential for big wins. Each mystery symbol has the potential to be cloned 1, 2, or 3 times, expanding onto adjacent tiles. Once the process is complete, the golden apple may reward you with a maximum payout of 5000 times your bet.\n\nAdditionally, there are 2 Progressive Jackpots available in this game - the Daily Drop and the Super Drop - that you can win by landing three jackpot symbols on the reels during any spin. The Super Drop is unlimited, while the Daily Drop can be won on a daily basis within a limited time frame. The amount you can win is proportional to your bet amount.\n\nFinally, the sparkling Diamond serves as the Wild symbol, substituting for any other symbol on the reels. Landing 7 diamonds on the reels results in a 175x multiplier of your bet.\n\nOverall, Mystery Reels Power Reels is a fun and intuitive online slot game that offers simplicity and great gameplay.
