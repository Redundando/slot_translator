The RTP is 95.7%, and the volatility is medium.\n\nPrometheus Titan Symbol without Registration:\n\nThere are eight paying symbols on the reels:\n\n· 4 are low-value gem icons worth 1 time the bet for five of the same kind;\n\n· 4 are the symbols Eagle, Minotaur, Medusa, and presumably Prometheus, which pay 2-5 times the bet for five identical icons.\n\nThe wilds stop on reels 1, 2, 3, or 4 and can replace any normal paying symbol or get their own 3 or 4 equal wins.\n\nPrometheus Titan of Fire: features of the slot machine\n\nWhen it comes to features, Prometheus Titan of Fire is a mix of coin collections, respins, and free spins. Let's analyze them together below:\n\n· Fire Collect Functionality\n\nFire Collect symbols are present on reels 1 and 5 in the base or bonus game.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nPrometheus Titan of Fire\nFantasma Games\nGameplay (paylines, RTP, max payout)\nReel layout and betting options\nSymbols and their values\nGame features (coin collections, respins, and free spins)\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Prometheus Titan of Fire\n\nFantasma Games, the Swedish software provider, has decided to celebrate the mythical figure of Prometheus with a new online slot titled Prometheus Titan of Fire. With 40 paylines, an RTP of 95.7%, and a maximum payout of 1,356x your bet, this new mythological-themed title is ideal for fans of hold 'n win and free spin style games. Descend into the mysterious underground to challenge the terrible Minotaur after reading my review!\n\nPrometheus Titan of Fire: Gameplay and Betting\n\nFirst, set your bet between €0.20 up to €100 per spin using a tablet, mobile device, or desktop. The game takes place on a 5-reel grid, arranged in a 3-4-4-4-3 layout. With this configuration, users get 40 fixed paylines on which to make winning combinations. The RTP is 95.7%, and the volatility is medium.\n\nPrometheus Titan Symbol without Registration:\n\nThere are eight paying symbols on the reels:\n\n· 4 are low-value gem icons worth 1 time the bet for five of the same kind;\n\n· 4 are the symbols Eagle, Minotaur, Medusa, and presumably Prometheus, which pay 2-5 times the bet for five identical icons.\n\nThe wilds stop on reels 1, 2, 3, or 4 and can replace any normal paying symbol or get their own 3 or 4 equal wins.\n\nPrometheus Titan of Fire: features of the slot machine\n\nWhen it comes to features, Prometheus Titan of Fire is a mix of coin collections, respins, and free spins. Let's analyze them together below:\n\n· Fire Collect Functionality\n\nFire Collect symbols are present on reels 1 and 5 in the base or bonus game. If a Fire Collect symbol stops simultaneously on one or more Coin icons on the three central reels, the token values ​​are assigned. Coins can be worth from 1 to 30 times the bet.\n\n· Double Collect Respin\n\nIf both Fire Collect symbols stop, they activate the Double Collect Respin. Reels 1 and 5 are locked, while 3 respins are awarded, which can only hit coins or empty spaces. At the end of the free spins, all token values ​​displayed will be counted twice.\n\n· Free Spins\n\nGetting 3 bonus symbols in the base game activates the bonus round, in which 12 free spins are awarded. In the FS, each position on the three central reels starts with a Hot Spot level equal to 1. Any coin symbol landed increases the Hot Spot value by +1 at the end of the spin. The collection mechanic proceeds based on a table visible in the game's regulations.\n\n· Super Free Spins\n\nAll hotspots active from free spins are transferred to Super Free Spins. A collection symbol is locked in position on reels 1 and 5, as are 3 coin symbols on the three central reels. At this point, 5 respins are activated in which any new coin or collection symbol locks in position. At the end of the spins, token values ​​are collected a number of times equal to the number of locked collection symbols.\n\n· Bonus Purchase\n\nFinally, where available, players can spend 70 times the bet to purchase free spins. This way, you are provided with an RTP of 96.4%.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nDoes this slot have a progressive jackpot?\n\nNo. The Prometheus Titan of Fire slot does not have a progressive jackpot, but it has many Free Spin features to increase your winnings.\n\nHow much can I win in this game?\n\nPrometheus Titan of Fire can pay up to 1,356 times the bet. This means that you can win average amounts of € 1,356 (when playing with real money) by betting only €1.\n\nCan I play Prometheus Titan of Fire for free?\n\nYes! You can try our free play demo for fun, without the risk of losing money, right here on Slotjava. You can play for free or with real money in all recommended ADM / AAMS casinos that have Fantasma Games slots.\n            ",

With 40 paylines, an RTP of 95.7%, and a maximum payout of 1,356x your bet, this new mythological-themed title is ideal for fans of hold 'n win and free spin style games. Descend into the mysterious underground to challenge the terrible Minotaur after reading my review!\n\nPrometheus Titan of Fire: Gameplay and Betting\n\nFirst, set your bet between €0.20 up to €100 per spin using a tablet, mobile device, or desktop. The game takes place on a 5-reel grid, arranged in a 3-4-4-4-3 layout. With this configuration, users get 40 fixed paylines on which to make winning combinations. The RTP is 95.7%, and the volatility is medium.\n\nPrometheus Titan Symbol without Registration:\n\nThere are eight paying symbols on the reels:\n\n· 4 are low-value gem icons worth 1 time the bet for five of the same kind;\n\n· 4 are the symbols Eagle, Minotaur, Medusa, and presumably Prometheus, which pay 2-5 times the bet for five identical icons.\n\nThe wilds stop on reels 1, 2, 3, or 4 and can replace any normal paying symbol or get their own 3 or 4 equal wins.\n\nPrometheus Titan of Fire: features of the slot machine\n\nWhen it comes to features, Prometheus Titan of Fire is a mix of coin collections, respins, and free spins. Let's analyze them together below:\n\n· Fire Collect Functionality\n\nFire Collect symbols are present on reels 1 and 5 in the base or bonus game. If a Fire Collect symbol stops simultaneously on one or more Coin icons on the three central reels, the token values ​​are assigned. Coins can be worth from 1 to 30 times the bet.\n\n· Double Collect Respin\n\nIf both Fire Collect symbols stop, they activate the Double Collect Respin. Reels 1 and 5 are locked, while 3 respins are awarded, which can only hit coins or empty spaces. At the end of the free spins, all token values ​​displayed will be counted twice.\n\n· Free Spins\n\nGetting 3 bonus symbols in the base game activates the bonus round, in which 12 free spins are awarded. In the FS, each position on the three central reels starts with a Hot Spot level equal to 1. Any coin symbol landed increases the Hot Spot value by +1 at the end of the spin. The collection mechanic proceeds based on a table visible in the game's regulations.\n\n· Super Free Spins\n\nAll hotspots active from free spins are transferred to Super Free Spins. A collection symbol is locked in position on reels 1 and 5, as are 3 coin symbols on the three central reels. At this point, 5 respins are activated in which any new coin or collection symbol locks in position. At the end of the spins, token values ​​are collected a number of times equal to the number of locked collection symbols.\n\n· Bonus Purchase\n\nFinally, where available, players can spend 70 times the bet to purchase free spins. This way, you are provided with an RTP of 96.4%.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nDoes this slot have a progressive jackpot?\n\nNo. The Prometheus Titan of Fire slot does not have a progressive jackpot, but it has many Free Spin features to increase your winnings.\n\nHow much can I win in this game?\n\nPrometheus Titan of Fire can pay up to 1,356 times the bet.

With 40 paylines, an RTP of 95.7%, and a maximum payout of 1,356x your bet, this new mythological-themed title is ideal for fans of hold 'n win and free spin style games. Descend into the mysterious underground to challenge the terrible Minotaur after reading my review!\n\nPrometheus Titan of Fire: Gameplay and Betting\n\nFirst, set your bet between €0.20 up to €100 per spin using a tablet, mobile device, or desktop. The game takes place on a 5-reel grid, arranged in a 3-4-4-4-3 layout. With this configuration, users get 40 fixed paylines on which to make winning combinations. The RTP is 95.7%, and the volatility is medium.\n\nPrometheus Titan Symbol without Registration:\n\nThere are eight paying symbols on the reels:\n\n· 4 are low-value gem icons worth 1 time the bet for five of the same kind;\n\n· 4 are the symbols Eagle, Minotaur, Medusa, and presumably Prometheus, which pay 2-5 times the bet for five identical icons.\n\nThe wilds stop on reels 1, 2, 3, or 4 and can replace any normal paying symbol or get their own 3 or 4 equal wins.\n\nPrometheus Titan of Fire: features of the slot machine\n\nWhen it comes to features, Prometheus Titan of Fire is a mix of coin collections, respins, and free spins. Let's analyze them together below:\n\n· Fire Collect Functionality\n\nFire Collect symbols are present on reels 1 and 5 in the base or bonus game. If a Fire Collect symbol stops simultaneously on one or more Coin icons on the three central reels, the token values ​​are assigned. Coins can be worth from 1 to 30 times the bet.\n\n· Double Collect Respin\n\nIf both Fire Collect symbols stop, they activate the Double Collect Respin. Reels 1 and 5 are locked, while 3 respins are awarded, which can only hit coins or empty spaces. At the end of the free spins, all token values ​​displayed will be counted twice.\n\n· Free Spins\n\nGetting 3 bonus symbols in the base game activates the bonus round, in which 12 free spins are awarded. In the FS, each position on the three central reels starts with a Hot Spot level equal to 1. Any coin symbol landed increases the Hot Spot value by +1 at the end of the spin. The collection mechanic proceeds based on a table visible in the game's regulations.\n\n· Super Free Spins\n\nAll hotspots active from free spins are transferred to Super Free Spins. A collection symbol is locked in position on reels 1 and 5, as are 3 coin symbols on the three central reels. At this point, 5 respins are activated in which any new coin or collection symbol locks in position. At the end of the spins, token values ​​are collected a number of times equal to the number of locked collection symbols.\n\n· Bonus Purchase\n\nFinally, where available, players can spend 70 times the bet to purchase free spins. This way, you are provided with an RTP of 96.4%.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nDoes this slot have a progressive jackpot?\n\nNo. The Prometheus Titan of Fire slot does not have a progressive jackpot, but it has many Free Spin features to increase your winnings.\n\nHow much can I win in this game?\n\nPrometheus Titan of Fire can pay up to 1,356 times the bet. This means that you can win average amounts of € 1,356 (when playing with real money) by betting only €1.\n\nCan I play Prometheus Titan of Fire for free?\n\nYes!
