Set in a spooky Halloween night, a cascade of candies falls onto the reels to create great winning combinations or trigger free spins, double symbols, and wild wins. The 96.62% RTP and high volatility make this game too hot to handle! To get a payout, 3 or more matching symbols must land anywhere on adjacent reels. Watch out for horizontal wins, which on certain lines pay 2x or 3x multipliers for even greater potential. You can't miss the grinning Jack O Lantern Wild that replaces all other symbols. It also functions as a scatter, awarding 6 or 12 free games. Created using HTML5 technology, this slot can be played on both PC and mobile with its 5x5 grid that's perfectly compatible on Android or iPhone.\n\nHow to play Hot Hot Halloween slot without registration?\n\nStart by taking a look at the Paytable by clicking to the left of the interface. Click the menu at the bottom to read the game rules and how to play. In the bottom right corner of the screen, you'll find a volume slider control, a turbo play icon to speed up your spins, and a full-screen icon. Click on Autoplay to the right of the Bet Selector button to choose between 10 and 500 Autospins. Set win and loss limits to keep an eye on your bankroll. Next, set your bet based on the number of spins you want to play, monitoring your spending margin. The Paytable will automatically calculate the payout. If you want to play with the maximum bet, tap the Max Bet button to the left of the Bet Selector button. Use the + and - symbols to adjust the bet level and the coin value according to your preferences. When you're ready to play, press the Spin button and enjoy the spooky Hot Hot Halloween!\n\nBet Levels and Main Symbols of Hot Hot Halloween\n\nIn this slot, players can select bets starting from €0.01 up to €25.00 per spin with bet levels of 1, 2, 5, 7, and 10. The selections are then multiplied by 20x the total bet. The minimum bet is €0.20 and the maximum is €5,000.00 when playing for cash prizes. It's clear that there are many potentials in this slot thanks to the doubled and tripled symbols and the potential top prize that reaches up to 11,250 times your bet in a single spin!\n\nWhich symbols pay the most?\n\nThe top prize available in the base game is 1250 times the bet when you get 5 triple pumpkin symbols on a payline. But beware: this is a high volatility slot, so the maxi wins don't come easily. Other symbols and their payouts include: Stars pay 22.5x, The Green Hand pays 25x, The Blue Ghost pays 40x, Eyeballs pay 50x, and Macabre Bare pay 75x.\n\nHot Hot Bonus Feature and Free Spins Feature\n\nThe Hot Hot Bonus feature is activated randomly and transforms all single symbols into doubles that count as two symbols, except for the 7, which triples to count as three symbols. The Free Spins feature is activated if you get three pumpkin symbols (single and double) from left to right or from right to left. These spins play with locked symbols that can double and triple.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Hot Hot Halloween Slot\n\nHabanero slots usually strike the right balance between risk, reward, and pure fun, and this game is no exception. It's worth playing all year round because huge payouts are on offer even though the volatility remains high. But there's so much to appreciate that you'll love the tricks and treats to live a Halloween like a true fan of this thrilling festival! If you're more into the Christmas theme, don't miss Habanero's original version titled Naughty Santa!\n\n        \n            ",
