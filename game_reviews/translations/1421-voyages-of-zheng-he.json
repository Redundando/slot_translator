    "original_text": "\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He\nBasato sul racconto dell’esploratore cinese, l’ammiraglio Zheng He, questo slot riporta in vita una storia emozionante di avventura e scoperta. Durante la prima dinastia Ming, Zheng He era uno dei personaggi più influenti della Cina. Nato nel 1371, durante la sua celebre vita di leader militare ed esploratore marino, viaggiò fino all’Arabia e al Corno d’Africa.\nUna brillante funzione di decisione del giocatore in questo gioco permette ai giocatori di scegliere la loro varianza di giri gratis (rapporto tra il numero di giri gratis e il moltiplicatore). La funzione bonus in sé consiste in un gioco di scelta dove i giocatori scelgono una coppa per vincere la varianza di giri libera scelta.\nUna grafica da esploratore\nLa grafica di questa slot ha un aspetto leggermente retrò, dovuto in parte al fatto che il gioco ha avuto un enorme successo come video slot nei casinò tradizionali prima di essere lanciato online. Le bobine sono progettate come antiche pergamene, posizionate di fronte ad un profondo oceano blu. Il sole sta tramontando, con il risultato di una splendida tonalità arancione sull’azzurro del mare. I simboli sono tutti basati su antichi oggetti cinesi, così come tesori, scoperte e riferimenti ai viaggi marini. I simboli del gioco includono 10, J, Q, Q, K e A, tutti disegnati con caratteri in stile cinese, oltre a monete d’oro, una statua di giada, una campana, un veliero, un tavolo d’oro, una mappa e lo stesso Zheng He.\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He si basa sulla pura qualità grafica per impressionare i giocatori e lasciare un’impressione positiva e duratura fin dall’inizio.\nLo sfondo del gioco è un pannello astratto, cremisi, che ricorda il fuoco o la lava. Non c’è molto da vedere qui, ma le bobine sono semplicemente bellissime. Incorniciate in una teca dorata con sopra delle navi in miniatura, la loro semplicità è ancora sufficiente a far risaltare il gioco.\nAggiungete delle belle animazioni in-game e una colonna sonora accattivante, e avrete tutti gli ingredienti per un bel gioco di slot. Passiamo alle regole del gioco nella prossima sezione della nostra recensione.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nIl gioco presenta due caratteristiche bonus principali. La prima è sotto forma del simbolo Wild, una moneta d’oro che sostituisce tutti gli altri simboli oltre al bonus Scatter. Il simbolo del bonus Spargimento è una carta nautica, o mappa, disegnata su un’antica pergamena. Questo incantevole simbolo è quello che si vuole tenere d’occhio, e questo perché tre di essi innescano la funzione di decisione del giocatore, seguita dalla funzione di scelta del bonus. Tre di questi simboli raddoppiano anche le scommesse su quella rotazione. I simboli del bonus appaiono solo sulle tre bobine centrali.\nDurante la Player Decision Feature, per prima cosa si può decidere cosa si vuole come possibile premio in base alle seguenti opzioni:\n20 giri gratuiti con moltiplicatore casuale di 3x, 2x o 1x\n15 giri liberi con moltiplicatore casuale di 5x, 2x o 1x\n10 giri liberi con moltiplicatore casuale di 8x, 2x o 1x\nDopo di che, si sceglie una delle tre coppe, una delle quali nasconde una pallina d’oro. Se otterrete la palla d’oro, riceverete i vostri giri gratis con un moltiplicatore e li godrete alla stessa puntata della scommessa iniziale che ha attivato il bonus.\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He presenta una selezione più che decente di caratteristiche speciali e simboli di bobina che esamineremo qui.\nLa Moneta d’oro trafitta è il jolly, che si può usare per sostituire qualsiasi simbolo di base e segnare vittorie extra. Anche le combinazioni di monete sono di per sé estremamente preziose.\nLa Mappa è un elemento importante per qualsiasi esploratore, e qui serve anche come simbolo di Spargimento che può assegnare un premio in denaro indipendentemente dall’allineamento. Dopo la vincita di uno Scatter, i giocatori avranno la possibilità di scegliere tra le opzioni Bonus. La scelta è prima di tutto tra 10, 15 o 20 giri gratis. Ogni opzione porta una serie di potenziali moltiplicatori. La quarta scelta è la caratteristica originale della coppa, dove una palla dorata è nascosta sotto una delle tre coppe. Dopo lo shuffling, il vostro compito consiste nell’indovinare o indovinare correttamente la posizione della palla, che può assegnare il Jackpot finale del gioco.\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He è epico come suggerisce il titolo. Il gioco ha un bell’aspetto ed è facile da impostare, nonostante la barra di comando minimalista.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nSe ti piace 1421 Voyages of Zheng He, ti piacerà il Sinbad’s Golden Voyage. Questo racconto di Sinbad, l’esploratore arabo immaginario, è stato prodotto da Playtech, ma presenta molti degli stessi simboli di Zheng He, come le navi e il tesoro. Con 164 linee, una scommessa minima di 2p, simboli impilati, espansione di wilds e giri liberi, questo gioco è eccitante come navigare i sette mari stessi.\n",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"1421 Voyages of Zheng He\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He\n\nBased on the story of Chinese explorer, Admiral Zheng He, this slot brings to life an exciting tale of adventure and discovery. During the Ming Dynasty, Zheng He was one of the most influential figures in China. Born in 1371, during his celebrated life as a military leader and sea explorer, he traveled as far as Arabia and the Horn of Africa.\n\nA brilliant player decision feature in this game allows players to choose their variance of free spins (ratio between the number of free spins and the multiplier). The bonus feature itself consists of a choice game where players pick a cup to win their chosen variance of free spins.\n\nExplorer's Graphics\n\nThe graphics of this slot have a slightly retro look, partly due to the fact that the game was hugely successful as a video slot in traditional casinos before being launched online. The reels are designed like ancient scrolls, positioned in front of a deep blue ocean. The sun is setting, resulting in a splendid orange hue on the blue sea. The symbols are all based on ancient Chinese objects, as well as treasures, discoveries, and references to sea voyages. The game symbols include 10, J, Q, Q, K and A, all drawn in Chinese-style characters, as well as gold coins, a jade statue, a bell, a sailing ship, a golden table, a map, and Zheng He himself.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He relies on pure graphic quality to impress players and leave a lasting positive impression right from the start.\n\nThe background of the game is an abstract, crimson panel, reminiscent of fire or lava. There's not much to see here, but the reels are simply beautiful. Framed in a golden case with miniature ships above, their simplicity is still enough to make the game stand out.\n\nAdd beautiful in-game animations and a catchy soundtrack, and you have all the ingredients for a great slot game. Let's move on to the game rules in the next section of our review.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of Slot Machine\n\nThe game features two main bonus features. The first is in the form of the Wild symbol, a gold coin that replaces all other symbols except the Scatter bonus. The Scatter bonus symbol is a nautical card, or map, drawn on an ancient scroll. This lovely symbol is what you want to keep an eye out for, because three of them trigger the player decision feature, followed by the bonus choice feature. Three of these symbols also double the bets on that spin. Bonus symbols appear only on the three central reels.\n\nDuring the Player Decision Feature, first you can decide what you want as a potential prize based on the following options:\n\n20 free spins with a random multiplier of 3x, 2x or 1x\n15 free spins with a random multiplier of 5x, 2x or 1x\n10 free spins with a random multiplier of 8x, 2x or 1x\nAfter that, you choose one of the three cups, one of which hides a golden ball. If you get the golden ball, you receive your free spins with a multiplier and enjoy them at the same initial bet that triggered the bonus.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He presents a more than decent selection of special features and reel symbols that we will examine here.\n\nThe pierced gold coin is the wild, which can be used to replace any base symbol and score extra wins. Even coin combinations are extremely valuable in themselves.\n\nThe map is an important element for any explorer, and here it also serves as a Scatter symbol that can award a cash prize regardless of alignment. After winning a Scatter, players will have the option to choose between Bonus options. The choice is first between 10, 15, or 20 free spins. Each option carries a series of potential multipliers. The fourth choice is the original Cup feature, where a golden ball is hidden under one of the three cups. After shuffling, your task is to guess or correctly guess the position of the ball, which can award the final Jackpot of the game.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He is epic as the title suggests. The game looks great and is easy to set up, despite the minimalist command bar.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nIf you like 1421 Voyages of Zheng He, you will like Sinbad's Golden Voyage. This tale of Sinbad, the imaginary Arab explorer, was produced by Playtech, but features many of the same symbols as Zheng He, such as ships and treasure. With 164 lines, a minimum bet of 2p, stacked symbols, expanding wilds, and free spins, this game is as exciting as sailing the seven seas.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame Description\nPlayer Decision Feature\nBonus Features\nGraphics and Symbols\nEase of Set-up\nSimilar Games\nAdmiral Zheng He's Story\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: 1421 Voyages of Zheng He\n\nBased on the story of Chinese explorer, Admiral Zheng He, this slot brings to life an exciting tale of adventure and discovery. During the Ming Dynasty, Zheng He was one of the most influential figures in China. Born in 1371, during his celebrated life as a military leader and sea explorer, he traveled as far as Arabia and the Horn of Africa.\n\nA brilliant player decision feature in this game allows players to choose their variance of free spins (ratio between the number of free spins and the multiplier). The bonus feature itself consists of a choice game where players pick a cup to win their chosen variance of free spins.\n\nExplorer's Graphics\n\nThe graphics of this slot have a slightly retro look, partly due to the fact that the game was hugely successful as a video slot in traditional casinos before being launched online. The reels are designed like ancient scrolls, positioned in front of a deep blue ocean. The sun is setting, resulting in a splendid orange hue on the blue sea. The symbols are all based on ancient Chinese objects, as well as treasures, discoveries, and references to sea voyages. The game symbols include 10, J, Q, Q, K and A, all drawn in Chinese-style characters, as well as gold coins, a jade statue, a bell, a sailing ship, a golden table, a map, and Zheng He himself.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He relies on pure graphic quality to impress players and leave a lasting positive impression right from the start.\n\nThe background of the game is an abstract, crimson panel, reminiscent of fire or lava. There's not much to see here, but the reels are simply beautiful. Framed in a golden case with miniature ships above, their simplicity is still enough to make the game stand out.\n\nAdd beautiful in-game animations and a catchy soundtrack, and you have all the ingredients for a great slot game. Let's move on to the game rules in the next section of our review.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of Slot Machine\n\nThe game features two main bonus features. The first is in the form of the Wild symbol, a gold coin that replaces all other symbols except the Scatter bonus. The Scatter bonus symbol is a nautical card, or map, drawn on an ancient scroll. This lovely symbol is what you want to keep an eye out for, because three of them trigger the player decision feature, followed by the bonus choice feature. Three of these symbols also double the bets on that spin. Bonus symbols appear only on the three central reels.\n\nDuring the Player Decision Feature, first you can decide what you want as a potential prize based on the following options:\n\n20 free spins with a random multiplier of 3x, 2x or 1x\n15 free spins with a random multiplier of 5x, 2x or 1x\n10 free spins with a random multiplier of 8x, 2x or 1x\nAfter that, you choose one of the three cups, one of which hides a golden ball. If you get the golden ball, you receive your free spins with a multiplier and enjoy them at the same initial bet that triggered the bonus.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He presents a more than decent selection of special features and reel symbols that we will examine here.\n\nThe pierced gold coin is the wild, which can be used to replace any base symbol and score extra wins. Even coin combinations are extremely valuable in themselves.\n\nThe map is an important element for any explorer, and here it also serves as a Scatter symbol that can award a cash prize regardless of alignment. After winning a Scatter, players will have the option to choose between Bonus options. The choice is first between 10, 15, or 20 free spins. Each option carries a series of potential multipliers. The fourth choice is the original Cup feature, where a golden ball is hidden under one of the three cups. After shuffling, your task is to guess or correctly guess the position of the ball, which can award the final Jackpot of the game.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He is epic as the title suggests. The game looks great and is easy to set up, despite the minimalist command bar.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nIf you like 1421 Voyages of Zheng He, you will like Sinbad's Golden Voyage. This tale of Sinbad, the imaginary Arab explorer, was produced by Playtech, but features many of the same symbols as Zheng He, such as ships and treasure. With 164 lines, a minimum bet of 2p, stacked symbols, expanding wilds, and free spins, this game is as exciting as sailing the seven seas.\n            ",

It's like making important business decisions but with less risk and more excitement. Players get to choose their variance of free spins, which is like picking your favorite ice cream flavor - it's all good. And if you're feeling lucky, go ahead and choose the high variance. But if you're like me and prefer to play it safe, the low variance is just as sweet.</p>\n\n  <p>Now, let's talk about the bonus feature. Who doesn't love a good game of chance? The bonus choice game allows players to pick a cup and win their chosen variance of free spins. It's like playing a game of beer pong, but without the alcohol (unless you're into that kind of thing). Plus, the Scatter bonus symbol is a nautical map, so it's like we're playing a treasure hunt on the high seas.</p>\n\n  <p>And let's not forget about the Wild symbol - a shiny gold coin that replaces all other symbols. It's like having a wildcard up your sleeve during a game of poker. It's smooth sailing when you see that little beauty pop up on your screen.</p>\n\n  <p>To top it all off, the game includes in-game animations and a catchy soundtrack. It's almost like we're watching a movie about the voyages of Zheng He, but we get to be the star of the show.</p>\n\n  <p>So, if you're looking for an adventure and a chance to win some serious bling, 1421 Voyages of Zheng He is the game for you. It's like exploring uncharted territory, but with way fewer risks and way more bonuses. Get ready to become a legendary explorer and take home some serious treasure!</p>"

The game truly captures the essence of Chinese culture with its beautifully designed graphics, ancient treasures, and references to sea voyages. It's like a history lesson, but with way more fun and the chance to win some serious coin.</p>\n\n  <p>But let's get to the real meat of the game - the player decision feature. It's like making important business decisions but with less risk and more excitement. Players get to choose their variance of free spins, which is like picking your favorite ice cream flavor - it's all good. And if you're feeling lucky, go ahead and choose the high variance. But if you're like me and prefer to play it safe, the low variance is just as sweet.</p>\n\n  <p>Now, let's talk about the bonus feature. Who doesn't love a good game of chance? The bonus choice game allows players to pick a cup and win their chosen variance of free spins. It's like playing a game of beer pong, but without the alcohol (unless you're into that kind of thing). Plus, the Scatter bonus symbol is a nautical map, so it's like we're playing a treasure hunt on the high seas.</p>\n\n  <p>And let's not forget about the Wild symbol - a shiny gold coin that replaces all other symbols. It's like having a wildcard up your sleeve during a game of poker. It's smooth sailing when you see that little beauty pop up on your screen.</p>\n\n  <p>To top it all off, the game includes in-game animations and a catchy soundtrack. It's almost like we're watching a movie about the voyages of Zheng He, but we get to be the star of the show.</p>\n\n  <p>So, if you're looking for an adventure and a chance to win some serious bling, 1421 Voyages of Zheng He is the game for you. It's like exploring uncharted territory, but with way fewer risks and way more bonuses. Get ready to become a legendary explorer and take home some serious treasure!</p>\"\n}"

The game features a player decision feature, which allows players to choose their variance of free spins. The bonus feature consists of a choice game where players pick a cup to win their chosen variance of free spins. The graphics and symbols of the game are all based on ancient Chinese objects, treasures, discoveries, and references to sea voyages. The game includes a Wild symbol, a gold coin, which replaces all other symbols except the Scatter bonus. The Scatter bonus symbol is a nautical card, or map, drawn on an ancient scroll, which triggers the player decision feature and the bonus choice feature. There are in-game animations and a catchy soundtrack.\n\nPlayer Decision Feature\n\nThe player decision feature in 1421 Voyages of Zheng He allows players to choose their variance of free spins. Players can decide what they want as a potential prize based on the following options:\n\n- 20 free spins with a random multiplier of 3x, 2x or 1x\n- 15 free spins with a random multiplier of 5x, 2x or 1x\n- 10 free spins with a random multiplier of 8x, 2x or 1x\n\nAfter that, players must choose one of the three cups, one of which hides a golden ball. If players get the golden ball, they receive their free spins with a multiplier and enjoy them at the same initial bet that triggered the bonus.\n\nBonus Features\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He features two main bonus features. The first is in the form of the Wild symbol, a gold coin that replaces all other symbols except the Scatter bonus. The Scatter bonus symbol is a nautical card, or map, drawn on an ancient scroll. Three of these symbols trigger the player decision feature, followed by the bonus choice feature. Three of these symbols also double the bets on that spin. Bonus symbols appear only on the three central reels. The second bonus feature is the choice game where players pick a cup to win their chosen variance of free spins.\n\nGraphics and Symbols\n\nThe graphics of 1421 Voyages of Zheng He have a retro look due to the fact that the game was originally launched as a video slot in traditional casinos. The reels are designed like ancient scrolls, positioned in front of a deep blue ocean. The background of the game is an abstract, crimson panel. The symbols of the game are all based on ancient Chinese objects, treasures, discoveries, and references to sea voyages. The game symbols include 10, J, Q, Q, K and A, all in Chinese-style characters, as well as gold coins, a jade statue, a bell, a sailing ship, a golden table, a map, and Zheng He himself. The graphics are impressive and the symbols are designed to match the theme of the game perfectly.\n\nEase of Set-up\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He is easy to set up, despite the minimalist command bar. The game is user-friendly and you can easily adjust the bet size, the number of paylines, and spin the reels. The game also features an autoplay option, which allows you to play a set number of spins automatically at the same bet level.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nIf players like 1421 Voyages of Zheng He, they may also like Sinbad's Golden Voyage. This game is produced by Playtech and features many of the same symbols as Zheng He, such as ships and treasure, but has a different theme based on Sinbad, the imaginary Arab explorer. Sinbad's Golden Voyage has 164 lines, a minimum bet of 2p, stacked symbols, expanding wilds, and free spins.\n\nAdmiral Zheng He's Story\n\nAdmiral Zheng He was a Chinese explorer who lived during the Ming Dynasty. He was born in 1371 and was one of the most influential figures in China during his celebrated life as a military leader and sea explorer. He traveled as far as Arabia and the Horn of Africa, and his voyages helped to establish Chinese trade and diplomatic relations with foreign countries. Zheng He's story is the inspiration for the 1421 Voyages of Zheng He slot game.\n\n        \n            ",

During the Ming Dynasty, Zheng He was one of the most influential figures in China. Born in 1371, during his celebrated life as a military leader and sea explorer, he traveled as far as Arabia and the Horn of Africa.\n\nA brilliant player decision feature in this game allows players to choose their variance of free spins (ratio between the number of free spins and the multiplier). The bonus feature itself consists of a choice game where players pick a cup to win their chosen variance of free spins.\n\nExplorer's Graphics\n\nThe graphics of this slot have a slightly retro look, partly due to the fact that the game was hugely successful as a video slot in traditional casinos before being launched online. The reels are designed like ancient scrolls, positioned in front of a deep blue ocean. The sun is setting, resulting in a splendid orange hue on the blue sea. The symbols are all based on ancient Chinese objects, as well as treasures, discoveries, and references to sea voyages. The game symbols include 10, J, Q, Q, K and A, all drawn in Chinese-style characters, as well as gold coins, a jade statue, a bell, a sailing ship, a golden table, a map, and Zheng He himself.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He relies on pure graphic quality to impress players and leave a lasting positive impression right from the start.\n\nThe background of the game is an abstract, crimson panel, reminiscent of fire or lava. There's not much to see here, but the reels are simply beautiful. Framed in a golden case with miniature ships above, their simplicity is still enough to make the game stand out.\n\nAdd beautiful in-game animations and a catchy soundtrack, and you have all the ingredients for a great slot game. Let's move on to the game rules in the next section of our review.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of Slot Machine\n\nThe game features two main bonus features. The first is in the form of the Wild symbol, a gold coin that replaces all other symbols except the Scatter bonus. The Scatter bonus symbol is a nautical card, or map, drawn on an ancient scroll. This lovely symbol is what you want to keep an eye out for, because three of them trigger the player decision feature, followed by the bonus choice feature. Three of these symbols also double the bets on that spin. Bonus symbols appear only on the three central reels.\n\nDuring the Player Decision Feature, first you can decide what you want as a potential prize based on the following options:\n\n20 free spins with a random multiplier of 3x, 2x or 1x\n15 free spins with a random multiplier of 5x, 2x or 1x\n10 free spins with a random multiplier of 8x, 2x or 1x\nAfter that, you choose one of the three cups, one of which hides a golden ball. If you get the golden ball, you receive your free spins with a multiplier and enjoy them at the same initial bet that triggered the bonus.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He presents a more than decent selection of special features and reel symbols that we will examine here.\n\nThe pierced gold coin is the wild, which can be used to replace any base symbol and score extra wins. Even coin combinations are extremely valuable in themselves.\n\nThe map is an important element for any explorer, and here it also serves as a Scatter symbol that can award a cash prize regardless of alignment. After winning a Scatter, players will have the option to choose between Bonus options. The choice is first between 10, 15, or 20 free spins. Each option carries a series of potential multipliers. The fourth choice is the original Cup feature, where a golden ball is hidden under one of the three cups. After shuffling, your task is to guess or correctly guess the position of the ball, which can award the final Jackpot of the game.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He is epic as the title suggests. The game looks great and is easy to set up, despite the minimalist command bar.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nIf you like 1421 Voyages of Zheng He, you will like Sinbad's Golden Voyage. This tale of Sinbad, the imaginary Arab explorer, was produced by Playtech, but features many of the same symbols as Zheng He, such as ships and treasure. With 164 lines, a minimum bet of 2p, stacked symbols, expanding wilds, and free spins, this game is as exciting as sailing the seven seas.\n            ",

Bonus symbols appear only on the three central reels.\n\nDuring the Player Decision Feature, first you can decide what you want as a potential prize based on the following options:\n\n20 free spins with a random multiplier of 3x, 2x or 1x\n15 free spins with a random multiplier of 5x, 2x or 1x\n10 free spins with a random multiplier of 8x, 2x or 1x\nAfter that, you choose one of the three cups, one of which hides a golden ball. If you get the golden ball, you receive your free spins with a multiplier and enjoy them at the same initial bet that triggered the bonus.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He presents a more than decent selection of special features and reel symbols that we will examine here.\n\nThe pierced gold coin is the wild, which can be used to replace any base symbol and score extra wins. Even coin combinations are extremely valuable in themselves.\n\nThe map is an important element for any explorer, and here it also serves as a Scatter symbol that can award a cash prize regardless of alignment. After winning a Scatter, players will have the option to choose between Bonus options. The choice is first between 10, 15, or 20 free spins. Each option carries a series of potential multipliers. The fourth choice is the original Cup feature, where a golden ball is hidden under one of the three cups. After shuffling, your task is to guess or correctly guess the position of the ball, which can award the final Jackpot of the game.\n\n1421 Voyages of Zheng He is epic as the title suggests. The game looks great and is easy to set up, despite the minimalist command bar.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nIf you like 1421 Voyages of Zheng He, you will like Sinbad's Golden Voyage. This tale of Sinbad, the imaginary Arab explorer, was produced by Playtech, but features many of the same symbols as Zheng He, such as ships and treasure.
