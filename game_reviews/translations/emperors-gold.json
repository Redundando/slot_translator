Tra i personaggi rappresentati nei simboli troviamo l’Imperatore e la sua donna, forse l’Imperatrice o una concubina.\nAlla coppia si aggiungono due animali simbolo della Cina: la tigre e il panda. Sempre attinenti alla cultura cinese, troviamo il simbolo raffigurante l’ingresso della Città Proibita e la classica lanterna rossa.\nA chiudere il cerchio ci sono il simbolo del Drago, lo stesso che sfila al capodanno cinese,  e il simbolo scatter, che presenta dei fuochi d’artificio (altro elemento antico nella cultura del paese).\nLe funzioni e i bonus della slot\nSulla slot Emperor’s Gold c’è la possibilità di vincere giri gratuiti e aumentare la possibilità di ottenere grandi vincite con i simboli grazie alla funzione Big Bet.\nUna partita Big Bet consiste in 5 giri con dei rulli collegati.

This game can prove to be exceptionally lucrative, evoking the wealth that the Emperor was accustomed to, with its many golds.\n\nProduced by Barcrest, Emperor's Gold features 10 paylines and an RTP ranging from 94% to 98% depending on the size of the bets and game mode.\n\nSlot machine graphics\n\nThe graphics of Emperor's Gold have a comic book style that is a bit manneristic. Among the characters represented in the symbols, we find the Emperor and his woman, perhaps the Empress or a concubine.\n\nIn addition to the couple, two animals that are symbolic of China are included: the tiger and the panda. Always related to Chinese culture, we find the symbol representing the entrance of the Forbidden City and the classic red lantern.\n\nTo complete the circle, there is the symbol of the Dragon, the same one that parades during Chinese New Year, and the scatter symbol, which features fireworks (another ancient element in the country's culture).\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the slot\n\nIn Emperor's Gold, there is the possibility to win free spins and increase the chance of obtaining big wins with the symbols thanks to the Big Bet feature. \n\nA Big Bet game consists of 5 spins with connected reels. The winnings obtained with them are added to those of the base game. By playing the Big Bet, you can get various bonuses, including Mega and Super. With the Big Bet, each scatter symbol displayed is added to the trail (except when free spins are activated). Three or more scatter symbols displayed in the same Big Bet spin immediately award free spins, canceling the outcome and resetting the trail (the path). \n\nThe trail is assigned at the end of the Big Bet game. If you win extra Big Bet spins, the trail is reset but remains available during the additional spins. Keep in mind that Dragon symbols do not add to the path. \n\nIn addition to the Big Bet, there is still the possibility to win free spins through the fireworks symbol. With 3 symbols, you win 12 free spins, with 4 you win 14, while with 5 you win 15. During the free spins, all symbols of the images displayed on the reels will be replaced by the highlighted symbol. Each Dragon symbol displayed will advance the highlighted symbol on the trail of images.\n\nSimilar slots to Emperor's Gold\n\nKeeping in mind that this slot is about ancient Chinese emperors, it cannot be considered similar to those of other emperors such as those of ancient Rome. Rather, it is similar to those that recall the ancient Chinese Empire, such as Big Red Lantern, produced by Bally.\n            ",

With 10 paylines and an RTP ranging from 94% to 98%, Emperor's Gold can be very lucrative, featuring many symbols of gold.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the game\n\nEmperor's Gold has graphics with comic book-style characters, including the Emperor and a woman, the tiger and the panda, the entrance of the Forbidden City, the red lantern, the dragon, and fireworks. The game offers the possibility of winning free spins and big wins with the Big Bet feature.\n\nBig Bet option for free spins\n\nThe Big Bet feature grants players 5 spins with connected reels. Winnings from Big Bet spins are added to the base game, where players can earn various bonuses, including Mega and Super. Scatter symbols displayed in the Big Bet game are added to the trail, and three or more of these symbols immediately award free spins.\n\nTrail feature for added excitement\n\nEmperor's Gold has a unique trail feature where the path is assigned at the end of the Big Bet game. Dragon symbols do not add to the path, but all other symbols do. If players win extra Big Bet spins, the trail is reset but remains available during the additional spins. This adds a lot of excitement to gameplay.\n\nUnique spin on ancient Chinese culture and history\n\nEmperor's Gold offers a unique spin on ancient Chinese culture and history. Other similar slots that recall the Chinese Empire include Big Red Lantern, produced by Bally.\n\n        \n            ",

This game can prove to be exceptionally lucrative, evoking the wealth that the Emperor was accustomed to, with its many golds.\n\nProduced by Barcrest, Emperor's Gold features 10 paylines and an RTP ranging from 94% to 98% depending on the size of the bets and game mode.\n\nSlot machine graphics\n\nThe graphics of Emperor's Gold have a comic book style that is a bit manneristic. Among the characters represented in the symbols, we find the Emperor and his woman, perhaps the Empress or a concubine.\n\nIn addition to the couple, two animals that are symbolic of China are included: the tiger and the panda. Always related to Chinese culture, we find the symbol representing the entrance of the Forbidden City and the classic red lantern.\n\nTo complete the circle, there is the symbol of the Dragon, the same one that parades during Chinese New Year, and the scatter symbol, which features fireworks (another ancient element in the country's culture).\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the slot\n\nIn Emperor's Gold, there is the possibility to win free spins and increase the chance of obtaining big wins with the symbols thanks to the Big Bet feature. \n\nA Big Bet game consists of 5 spins with connected reels. The winnings obtained with them are added to those of the base game. By playing the Big Bet, you can get various bonuses, including Mega and Super. With the Big Bet, each scatter symbol displayed is added to the trail (except when free spins are activated). Three or more scatter symbols displayed in the same Big Bet spin immediately award free spins, canceling the outcome and resetting the trail (the path). \n\nThe trail is assigned at the end of the Big Bet game. If you win extra Big Bet spins, the trail is reset but remains available during the additional spins. Keep in mind that Dragon symbols do not add to the path. \n\nIn addition to the Big Bet, there is still the possibility to win free spins through the fireworks symbol. With 3 symbols, you win 12 free spins, with 4 you win 14, while with 5 you win 15. During the free spins, all symbols of the images displayed on the reels will be replaced by the highlighted symbol. Each Dragon symbol displayed will advance the highlighted symbol on the trail of images.\n\nSimilar slots to Emperor's Gold\n\nKeeping in mind that this slot is about ancient Chinese emperors, it cannot be considered similar to those of other emperors such as those of ancient Rome. Rather, it is similar to those that recall the ancient Chinese Empire, such as Big Red Lantern, produced by Bally.\n            ",

This game can prove to be exceptionally lucrative, evoking the wealth that the Emperor was accustomed to, with its many golds.\n\nProduced by Barcrest, Emperor's Gold features 10 paylines and an RTP ranging from 94% to 98% depending on the size of the bets and game mode.\n\nSlot machine graphics\n\nThe graphics of Emperor's Gold have a comic book style that is a bit manneristic. Among the characters represented in the symbols, we find the Emperor and his woman, perhaps the Empress or a concubine.\n\nIn addition to the couple, two animals that are symbolic of China are included: the tiger and the panda. Always related to Chinese culture, we find the symbol representing the entrance of the Forbidden City and the classic red lantern.\n\nTo complete the circle, there is the symbol of the Dragon, the same one that parades during Chinese New Year, and the scatter symbol, which features fireworks (another ancient element in the country's culture).\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the slot\n\nIn Emperor's Gold, there is the possibility to win free spins and increase the chance of obtaining big wins with the symbols thanks to the Big Bet feature. \n\nA Big Bet game consists of 5 spins with connected reels. The winnings obtained with them are added to those of the base game. By playing the Big Bet, you can get various bonuses, including Mega and Super. With the Big Bet, each scatter symbol displayed is added to the trail (except when free spins are activated). Three or more scatter symbols displayed in the same Big Bet spin immediately award free spins, canceling the outcome and resetting the trail (the path). \n\nThe trail is assigned at the end of the Big Bet game. If you win extra Big Bet spins, the trail is reset but remains available during the additional spins. Keep in mind that Dragon symbols do not add to the path. \n\nIn addition to the Big Bet, there is still the possibility to win free spins through the fireworks symbol. With 3 symbols, you win 12 free spins, with 4 you win 14, while with 5 you win 15. During the free spins, all symbols of the images displayed on the reels will be replaced by the highlighted symbol. Each Dragon symbol displayed will advance the highlighted symbol on the trail of images.\n\nSimilar slots to Emperor's Gold\n\nKeeping in mind that this slot is about ancient Chinese emperors, it cannot be considered similar to those of other emperors such as those of ancient Rome. Rather, it is similar to those that recall the ancient Chinese Empire, such as Big Red Lantern, produced by Bally.\n        ",
