    "original_text": "\nCongo Cash\nAmbientata nella foresta centroafricana, Congo Cash è una slot superlativa sotto tutti i punti di vista. Colori vivaci e una grafica di livello supportano un gioco che ha un gameplay divertente e molto intuitivo. A livello visivo, tutta la consolle si presenta piacevole. Lo sfondo è occupato interamente dalla natura lussureggiante tipica del luogo, con maestosi alberi, fiori dai mille colori e il gorilla simbolo della slot. Sulla parte sinistra sono indicati i 3 Jackpot a disposizione, mentre in basso si trovano i tasti per accedere al menù, il riassunto della vincita e i tasti per variare la puntata, oltre naturalmente a quelli per far ruotare i rulli, sia in modalità manuale che automatica. Completa il tutto una musica arcade intervallata da qualche effetto sonoro, oltre al suono meccanico della rotazione dei rulli.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia ha 5 rulli e 4 righe su cui si snodano ben 432 possibilità di vincita. La puntata minima è di 0,20 €, mentre la massima è di 100 €. Dal menù è possibile impostare tra 10 e 1.000 giri automatici e c’è anche l’opzione per accelerare la rotazione dei rulli attraverso il tasto turbo. Sempre dalle impostazioni è possibile disattivare la musica di sottofondo o anche soltanto gli effetti sonori che accompagnano le vincite. Congo Cash ha un RTP del 96,51% e una volatilità alta, ciò vuol dire che in media le vincite sono meno frequenti, ma sempre di alto livello.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nCome già detto, Congo Cash ha tantissime funzioni speciali essendo ricca di moltiplicatori, simboli Bonus e 3 Jackpot con vincite variabili in base al livello della scommessa, ma comunque in grado di offrire premi sostanziosi. Partiamo però dicendo che di norma si vince associando almeno 3 simboli uguali e adiacenti, da sinistra a destra. I simboli di basso valore sono quelli delle carte da gioco utili a comporre una scala reale, quindi dal 10 all’asso. La rana e il lemure offrono invece ricompense di medio valore, mentre il macaco e il giaguaro sono più generosi. Il gorilla è il simbolo che paga più di tutti.\nIl diamante è il nostro simbolo Wild , può apparire soltanto sui rulli 2, 3, 4 e 5 e va a sostituire tutti i simboli eccetto quelli speciali.\nSui rulli 2, 3 e 4 a ogni giro appaiono diversi premi, dai Free Spins ai moltiplicatori compresi tra 5x e 200x. Per averli sarà sufficiente associare 2 simboli farfalla a uno Congo Cash. Per quel che riguarda le partite gratuite, a ogni giro viene garantito almeno un simbolo Wild.\nSulla parte superiore dei rulli può apparire anche uno dei 3 Jackpot che variano in base al valore della puntata. A titolo di esempio, poniamo che volessimo puntare il minimo, cioè 0,20 €. In tal caso, il Jackpot Minor varrà 5 €, quello Major 20 € e il Grand 400 €!\n",

            "response": "Congo Cash\n\nSet in the heart of the Central African rainforest, Congo Cash is the crème de la crème of slot games. With vivid colors and top-notch graphics, the gameplay is both entertaining and intuitive. Visually, the console is absolutely delightful. The lush nature of the region dominates the background, with majestic trees, colorful flowers and the gorilla symbol of the game. The three available jackpots are indicated on the left, while the buttons to access the menu, summary of winnings and buttons to adjust the bet are located at the bottom, along with the manual and automatic spin buttons. The sound effects and arcade music add the perfect touch to the game.\n\nFeatures of the Slot\n\nThe grid features 5 reels and 4 rows with a whopping 432 possible winning combinations. The minimum bet is €0.20, while the maximum is €100. The menu settings allow for automatic spins ranging from 10 to 1,000, and even have a turbo button to speed up the spins. You can also toggle the background music and sound effects on and off. Congo Cash has an RTP of 96.51% and a high volatility, meaning while the winnings may be less frequent, they will be of high value.\n\nSymbols and functionality\n\nAs mentioned before, Congo Cash has plenty of special functions including multipliers, bonus symbols and 3 jackpots with varying payouts depending on the betting level. Combinations of at least 3 adjacent identical symbols from left to right are typically needed for a win. The low-value symbols are the playing cards, while the frog and lemur offer medium-value rewards. The monkey and jaguar are more generous, but the gorilla is the highest paying symbol of all. \n\nThe diamond is the Wild symbol and can appear only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, replacing all symbols except for special symbols. During each spin, different rewards such as Free Spins or multipliers ranging from 5x to 200x appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. Simply associate 2 butterfly symbols with a Congo Cash symbol to get them. During the free spins, at least one Wild symbol is guaranteed on each spin. One of the three jackpots can also appear on the top of the reels and vary in value depending on the bet. For example, if you bet the minimum of €0.20, the Minor jackpot is worth €5, Major is worth €20 and Grand is worth €400!",

Get ready to try your luck with Congo Cash, the superlative slot game set in the lush Central African forest. With its vibrant colors and top-notch graphics, this game offers exciting and intuitive gameplay that is sure to captivate. The visually pleasing console is set against a stunning backdrop of majestic trees, vibrant flowers, and the gorilla symbol of the slot. On the left side of the screen, you'll see the 3 Jackpots up for grabs, while at the bottom are buttons to access the menu, a summary of your winnings, and the option to adjust your bet, in addition to the buttons to spin the reels, either manually or automatically. It all comes together perfectly with an arcade-style music and the mechanical sound of the reels spinning.\n\nFeatures of the slot\nThe game's grid consists of 5 reels and 4 rows, offering a whopping 432 ways to win. The minimum bet is €0.20, while the maximum is €100. You can customize your experience with the option to set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins and can speed up the reels with the turbo button. Additionally, you can also turn off the background music or sound effects accompanying your wins from the settings. Congo Cash has an RTP of 96.51% with high volatility, meaning that although wins may be less frequent on average, they will be quite substantial.\n\nSymbols and special features\nCongo Cash is packed with special features, such as multipliers, bonus symbols, and 3 Jackpots that have variable payouts based on your bet level, offering the chance for substantial rewards. To start things off, you win by matching at least 3 identical symbols adjacent to each other, from left to right.

Give Congo Cash a spin and let the adventure begin!\n            ",

That's a lot of bananas! Well, not actual bananas, but you get the point.</p><p>If you're in a rush or just feeling impatient, you can always use the turbo button to speed up the reels or set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins.

On the left side of the screen, you'll see the 3 Jackpots up for grabs, while at the bottom are buttons to access the menu, a summary of your winnings, and the option to adjust your bet, in addition to the buttons to spin the reels, either manually or automatically. It all comes together perfectly with an arcade-style music and the mechanical sound of the reels spinning.\n\nFeatures of the slot\nThe game's grid consists of 5 reels and 4 rows, offering a whopping 432 ways to win. The minimum bet is €0.20, while the maximum is €100. You can customize your experience with the option to set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins and can speed up the reels with the turbo button. Additionally, you can also turn off the background music or sound effects accompanying your wins from the settings. Congo Cash has an RTP of 96.51% with high volatility, meaning that although wins may be less frequent on average, they will be quite substantial.\n\nSymbols and special features\nCongo Cash is packed with special features, such as multipliers, bonus symbols, and 3 Jackpots that have variable payouts based on your bet level, offering the chance for substantial rewards. To start things off, you win by matching at least 3 identical symbols adjacent to each other, from left to right. The low-value symbols include the playing card symbols needed to form a royal straight flush, ranging from 10 to ace. The frog and lemur offer medium rewards, while the monkey and jaguar provide more generous payouts. The gorilla is the highest paying symbol.\n\nThe diamond is the Wild symbol, appearing only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, and can substitute for all other symbols except the special ones. Every spin on reels 2, 3, and 4 will display various prizes, like free spins or multipliers ranging from 5x to 200x. To activate these, you'll need to match 2 butterfly symbols to a Congo Cash symbol. During free spins, at least one Wild symbol is guaranteed per spin.\n\nOn the top of the reels, one of the 3 Jackpots can also appear, with varying values depending on your bet. As an example, let's say you want to bet the minimum amount of €0.20. In that case, the minor Jackpot is worth €5, the major is €20, and the Grand is a whopping €400! Are you feeling lucky yet? Give Congo Cash a spin and let the adventure begin!\n            ",
