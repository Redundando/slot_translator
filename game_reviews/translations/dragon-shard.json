The Phoenix, symbolizing rebirth, and the luck-bringing fairies fit perfectly with the unexpected winnings that a slot machine can bring. That's why it's not surprising to see the use of dragons in Microgaming's Dragon Shard slot. Dragons have always symbolized wealth, both in Western culture where they hoard gold, and in Eastern culture where they guard immense treasures. \n\nFrom the moment you start playing, Dragon Shard immerses you into a world of untouched beauty and fantasy. The game grid, with all of its unique features (which we'll discuss in the next point of this review), is set in a valley full of water, trees, and grass. You'll also find structures that resemble temples, perhaps alluding to the divine nature of these fire-breathing beasts.\n\nThe classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J...) have been replaced by their suits (spades, diamonds, clubs and hearts), which resemble precious gems and blend well with the other images in the game.\n\nMoving on to the technical aspects that interest the experienced gambler, this slot deviates from the standard 5x3 mechanism of many online slots and instead uses a 5x5 structure. This rectangular game screen becomes a square that can contain up to 25 symbols per spin, increasing the possibility of using multiple winning lines and obtaining a wider range of winning combinations.\n\nThroughout the game, keep an eye out for the Dragon Shard symbol itself, which acts as the game's Wild symbol, substituting for all other symbols. Another notable symbol is the Dragon's Eye, which triggers the free spin feature.\n\nInnovation is key in this game: symbols can sometimes be hidden behind a question mark, and then revealed to all be the same (great for obtaining combinations). Symbols can also cover multiple spaces, especially those depicting various characters and which lead to high-value combinations.\n\nIf you're a fan of dragon-themed slots, other games like Triple Dragons and 8 Dragons, both from Pragmatic Play, offer a unique eastern take on dragon mythology.",

This symbol grants access to free spins, which means more opportunities to rack up big wins - and more opportunities to pretend like you're the Game of Thrones dragon queen (minus all the fire and death, of course).</p> \n                <p>But wait, there's more! Dragon Shard also features hidden symbols and stretched formats. It's like playing a game of hide and seek with a twist - you have the chance to find hidden symbols and unlock even more possibilities for winning combinations. It's like if a slot game and a puzzle game had a beautiful baby together.</p>\"\n}"

This layout increases the pay lines and generates more combinations. The Dragon Shard symbol serves as the wild, while the dragon's eye grants access to free spins. The game also features hidden symbols and stretched formats, opening up possibilities for more winning combinations.\n\nGraphic Design\n\nThe game board of Dragon Shard is set in a valley rich in water, trees, and grass, surrounded by structures that resemble temples. The playing card symbols have been replaced by suits that mimic precious gems, complementing the other fantastic images that appear on the game screen. The design is immersive, creating an environment that is both pure and fantastic.\n\nBonus Features\n\nDragon Shard offers several bonus features, including the Wild symbol (Dragon Shard) and the Dragon Eye symbol that activates the free spin function. Additionally, hidden symbols occasionally appear, which, when revealed, turn out to be all of the same type, offering excellent chances of obtaining winning combinations. Stretched symbols are also present in the game, covering more than one reel and providing valuable combinations.\n\nTheme and Story\n\nDragon Shard utilizes the theme of fantastic creatures, offering players a glimpse into the world of dragons. The game board is set in a valley surrounded by structures that hint at the divine nature of these fierce creatures. It highlights dragons as symbols of wealth, a common portrayal in both Eastern and Western cultures. The game immerses players in a pure and fantastic environment that enhances the gaming experience.\n\nCompetitor Analysis\n\nDragon Shard is not alone in providing dragon-themed slot games. Games like Pragmatic Play's Triple Dragons offer a Chinese cultural perspective of the iconic creatures. Another Microgaming slot, 8 Dragons, also showcases creatures from Chinese folklore and culture. However, Dragon Shard is unique in its gameplay mechanics, utilizing a 5x5 reel format, and offers several innovative bonus features that keep players engaged and captivated throughout the game.\n\n        \n            ",

From the Phoenix, representing rebirth, to the mischievous leprechauns representing good fortune, they all complement the unexpected win that a slot machine can bring. It is for this reason that the use of dragons in Microgaming's Dragon Shard slot machine does not come as a surprise. Dragons have always represented wealth, both in Western cultures where they hoard gold and in the Eastern cultures where they guard immense treasures.\n\nFrom the moment you launch the game, you are immersed in an environment that is both pure and fantastic. The game board is set in a valley rich in water, trees, and grass, surrounded by structures that resemble temples, perhaps alluding to the divine nature of these fire-breathing beasts. The classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J...) have been replaced by their respective suits (spades, diamonds, clubs, and hearts), resembling precious gems that blend well with the other images that appear on the game screen.\n\nIn terms of technical aspects, which are of great interest to any potential player, the slot deviates from the standard 5x3 mechanism of online slots and instead, utilizes a 5x5 reel format. The rectangular game board is thus transformed into a square, capable of accommodating 25 symbols per play, which effectively increases the possibility of using a greater number of pay lines and obtaining a wider range of combinations.\n\nThroughout the game, players should keep an eye out for the game's title itself, Dragon Shard, which serves as the Wild symbol, capable of replacing all other symbols on the game board. Another important symbol is the dragon's eye which grants access to the free spin function.\n\nDragon Shard offers several innovations that ensure players are always engaged and utterly captivated. Symbols occasionally appear hidden behind question marks, which, when revealed, turn out to be all of the same type– an excellent way of obtaining winning combinations. The symbols can also appear in a stretched format which covers more than one reel, particularly those that depict the various characters, and offer high-value combinations.\n\nFor those intrigued by dragon-themed slots, similar to Dragon Shard, there are a great number of alternatives available. While Microgaming's Dragon Shard presents a Western perspective of the winged creatures, Pragmatic Play's Triple Dragons utilizes the iconic symbols of Chinese culture. Another Microgaming slot, 8 Dragons, also showcases a host of creatures from Chinese folklore and culture.\n            ",

From the Phoenix, representing rebirth, to the mischievous leprechauns representing good fortune, they all complement the unexpected win that a slot machine can bring. It is for this reason that the use of dragons in Microgaming's Dragon Shard slot machine does not come as a surprise. Dragons have always represented wealth, both in Western cultures where they hoard gold and in the Eastern cultures where they guard immense treasures.\n\nFrom the moment you launch the game, you are immersed in an environment that is both pure and fantastic. The game board is set in a valley rich in water, trees, and grass, surrounded by structures that resemble temples, perhaps alluding to the divine nature of these fire-breathing beasts. The classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J...) have been replaced by their respective suits (spades, diamonds, clubs, and hearts), resembling precious gems that blend well with the other images that appear on the game screen.\n\nIn terms of technical aspects, which are of great interest to any potential player, the slot deviates from the standard 5x3 mechanism of online slots and instead, utilizes a 5x5 reel format. The rectangular game board is thus transformed into a square, capable of accommodating 25 symbols per play, which effectively increases the possibility of using a greater number of pay lines and obtaining a wider range of combinations.\n\nThroughout the game, players should keep an eye out for the game's title itself, Dragon Shard, which serves as the Wild symbol, capable of replacing all other symbols on the game board. Another important symbol is the dragon's eye which grants access to the free spin function.\n\nDragon Shard offers several innovations that ensure players are always engaged and utterly captivated. Symbols occasionally appear hidden behind question marks, which, when revealed, turn out to be all of the same type– an excellent way of obtaining winning combinations. The symbols can also appear in a stretched format which covers more than one reel, particularly those that depict the various characters, and offer high-value combinations.\n\nFor those intrigued by dragon-themed slots, similar to Dragon Shard, there are a great number of alternatives available. While Microgaming's Dragon Shard presents a Western perspective of the winged creatures, Pragmatic Play's Triple Dragons utilizes the iconic symbols of Chinese culture. Another Microgaming slot, 8 Dragons, also showcases a host of creatures from Chinese folklore and culture.\n        ",
