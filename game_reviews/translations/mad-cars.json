Also known as Mad Max, it is a series of films released between the late 1970s and 1980s starring Mel Gibson that has captivated millions of teenagers around the world. With our slot, there is undoubtedly a post-apocalyptic setting with powerful cars that the raiders move around on and the characters' vaguely punk appearance.\n\nLooking in detail, the Mad Cars game grid is located in an abandoned industrial site, with rusted iron scaffolds and large unused pipes. The graphics follow the style of cartoons, with characters of bright colors that contrast with those of the surrounding environment. The goal is to win the race among participating cars. An important contribution to recreating the right atmosphere comes from the soundtrack, a mix of metallic and industrial sounds, perfect for the type of game.\n\nA grid in the shape of a track\nThe Mad Cars grid has an elongated shape, with 5 reels, 6 rows, and 50 fixed paylines. To win, it is necessary to align three or more identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding to the right. The minimum bet is €0.10, a reasonable cost that allows you to play without going bankrupt. Automatic spins are available, ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 100. The volatility is moderate, with an RTP of 96.39%.\n\nA plethora of special symbols\nMad Cars' basic symbols are 8: the cone, the wrench, the steering wheel, and the dice have low values, while the race protagonists are worth much more.\nDuring regular play, special symbols can land, allowing for high-value wins. Let's take a closer look:\n\nInstant Prize Car Symbol: this symbol can only appear on the bottom row and has a multiplier ranging from 1x to 100x. It remains on the reels until a winning combo appears.\nThe Scatter Car Symbol: this can also only land on the bottom row and has an instant value of ten times the bet.\nMultiplier Symbols: can be applied to a single symbol and rewards an instant prize ranging from 2x to 100x.\nGas Symbol: associated with the first two bonuses and increases the symbol's value.\nMultiplier & Gas Combo Symbol: combines the two previous bonuses.\nSurvivor Symbol: allows you to race without the car being thrown off the reels.\n\nThe Mad Bonus Feature is a race between cars. Winning the challenge is equivalent to bringing home a very high sum.\n\nFAQ\nAre there classic Wild and Scatter symbols in Mad Cars?\nNo, in this slot, there are no Jokers that replace symbols or Scatters that give free spins. The latter are guaranteed by some conditions related to the Car Bonus.\n\nI see there are many special symbols, is it difficult to understand their function?\nAlthough it may seem daunting at first, a few practice spins will suffice to familiarize yourself with all the bonuses.\n\nCan I play Mad Cars on mobile?\nCertainly, Mad Cars is available for every device.",

Also known as Mad Max, it is a series of films that came out between the late 70s and the 80s starring Mel Gibson and that have captivated millions of teenagers around the world. What our slot machine undoubtedly has in common with it is the post-apocalyptic scenario, the powerful cars on which the raiders move, and the slightly punk look of the characters.\n\nLooking closer, Mad Cars' game grid is set in an abandoned industrial site with rusted iron scaffolding and large pipes now out of use. The graphics resemble those of cartoon style, with brightly colored characters that contrast with the opaque ones of the environment all around. The goal is to win the race among participating cars. An important contribution to recreate the right atmosphere comes from the soundtrack, a mix of metallic and industrial sounds, perfect for the type of game.\n\nA Grid Shaped Like a Racetrack\nMad Cars' grid has an elongated shape, with 5 reels, 6 rows, and 50 fixed pay lines. To win, it is necessary to align at least three identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding towards the right. The minimum bet is € 0.10, an affordable cost that allows for playing without breaking the bank. Automatic spins from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 100 are present. The volatility is medium, with an RTP equal to 96.39%.\n\nA Flood of Special Symbols\nMad Cars' basic symbols are 8: the cone, the wrench, the steering wheel, and the dice have a low value, while the race protagonists are worth much more.\nDuring regular play, special symbols can land that allow for high-value winnings. Let's look at them in detail:\n\nInstant Prize Car Symbol: this symbol can only appear on the bottom row and has a multiplier ranging from 1x to 100x. It remains on the reels until a winning combo appears.\nThe Scatter Car Symbol: this too can only land on the bottom row and has an instant value of ten times the bet.\nMultiplier Symbols: can be applied to a single symbol and gives an instant prize ranging from 2x to 100x.\nGas Symbol: associated with the first two bonuses and increases the symbol's value.\nMultiplier & Gas Combo Symbol: combines the previous two bonuses.\nSurvivor Symbol: allows to compete without the car being thrown off the reels.\n\nThe Mad Bonus Feature is a car race. Winning the challenge is equivalent to taking home a very high sum.\n\nFAQs\nAre there classic Scatter and Wild symbols in Mad Cars?\n\nNo, in this slot, there are no Jokers that replace symbols or Scatters that give free spins. The latter are guaranteed by some conditions related to the Car Bonus.\n\nI saw that there are many special symbols, is it difficult to understand their function?\n\nAlthough it may seem challenging at first, it will be enough to make a few trial spins to become familiar with all the bonuses.\n\nCan I play Mad Cars on a cell phone?\n\nOf course, Mad Cars is available for every device.\n            ",

The game grid has an elongated shape, featuring 5 reels, 6 rows, and 50 fixed pay lines. To win, it is necessary to align at least three identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding towards the right. Players can set their minimum bet at € 0.10, and automatic spins are available both from a minimum of 5 and up to 100.

Also known as Mad Max, it is a series of films that came out between the late 70s and the 80s starring Mel Gibson and that have captivated millions of teenagers around the world. What our slot machine undoubtedly has in common with it is the post-apocalyptic scenario, the powerful cars on which the raiders move, and the slightly punk look of the characters.\n\nLooking closer, Mad Cars' game grid is set in an abandoned industrial site with rusted iron scaffolding and large pipes now out of use. The graphics resemble those of cartoon style, with brightly colored characters that contrast with the opaque ones of the environment all around. The goal is to win the race among participating cars. An important contribution to recreate the right atmosphere comes from the soundtrack, a mix of metallic and industrial sounds, perfect for the type of game.\n\nA Grid Shaped Like a Racetrack\nMad Cars' grid has an elongated shape, with 5 reels, 6 rows, and 50 fixed pay lines. To win, it is necessary to align at least three identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding towards the right. The minimum bet is € 0.10, an affordable cost that allows for playing without breaking the bank. Automatic spins from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 100 are present. The volatility is medium, with an RTP equal to 96.39%.\n\nA Flood of Special Symbols\nMad Cars' basic symbols are 8: the cone, the wrench, the steering wheel, and the dice have a low value, while the race protagonists are worth much more.\nDuring regular play, special symbols can land that allow for high-value winnings. Let's look at them in detail:\n\nInstant Prize Car Symbol: this symbol can only appear on the bottom row and has a multiplier ranging from 1x to 100x. It remains on the reels until a winning combo appears.\nThe Scatter Car Symbol: this too can only land on the bottom row and has an instant value of ten times the bet.\nMultiplier Symbols: can be applied to a single symbol and gives an instant prize ranging from 2x to 100x.\nGas Symbol: associated with the first two bonuses and increases the symbol's value.\nMultiplier & Gas Combo Symbol: combines the previous two bonuses.\nSurvivor Symbol: allows to compete without the car being thrown off the reels.\n\nThe Mad Bonus Feature is a car race. Winning the challenge is equivalent to taking home a very high sum.\n\nFAQs\nAre there classic Scatter and Wild symbols in Mad Cars?\n\nNo, in this slot, there are no Jokers that replace symbols or Scatters that give free spins. The latter are guaranteed by some conditions related to the Car Bonus.\n\nI saw that there are many special symbols, is it difficult to understand their function?\n\nAlthough it may seem challenging at first, it will be enough to make a few trial spins to become familiar with all the bonuses.\n\nCan I play Mad Cars on a cell phone?\n\nOf course, Mad Cars is available for every device.\n        ",
