Another vital aspect that contributed to make it immortal is the army and war techniques, a machine so perfect that it allowed Rome to conquer territories far and wide. It is precisely the Roman army that inspired Maximus Soldier of Rome, a slot produced by Inspired. The graphics are quite simple with all the typical elements of the Roman army, such as the chariot or the shield with the double crossed swords. Two ancient columns delimit the playing grid and all the settings to set your best bet can be found on the left. Each spin is accompanied by the sound of trumpets and the mechanical sound of the reels.\nFeatures of Maximus Soldier of Rome\nThe grid has a traditional structure with 5 reels and 3 rows. There are 20 fixed paylines, with a minimum bet per line of 0.01 €, therefore 0.20 € for the total, a feature that makes it attractive even for those who do not want to invest large amounts. It is possible to increase the bet up to a maximum of 250 €. Winning combinations are formed on adjacent reels starting from the left. Maximus Soldier of Rome has an RTP in line with the norm, equal to 95%.\nSymbols and functionalities\nThe symbols K, Q and J are those that pay the least of all, followed by the helmet, the coin, the shield, the Colosseum and finally the chariot. The symbol that pays the absolute most is the inscription \"Maximus Soldier of Rome\". During regular play and entirely randomly, a modification of the reels may occur, introduced by the image of a centurion playing a trumpet. There are 4 types of reel modifiers:\n\nReelus Maximus: a huge symbol will cover reels 2, 3, 4, transforming the grid into a 3×3 one.\nSuper Bonus Reels: Bonus symbols will rain down on the reels\nBig Win: in this case, there is a guarantee of receiving a highly profitable win\n5 Equals: on the reels, we will see at least one win called \"5 equals\".\n\nThe Wild inscription has a value of a wild card and replaces all symbols except the Bonus one. If 3 or more Bonus symbols appear on the reels, then the grid will be replaced by a wheel that will give us a Bonus game. Let's see them in detail:\n\nPrizes on Parade: On the screen, we will see three shields, each containing a number of prizes, an arrow that allows us to move to the next shield, and various multipliers called collectors that will lead us to end the Bonus game\nCaesars Free Spins: the player has two wheels, one indicating the number of free spins available, one to select the multiplier valid during all Free Spins\nRoad to Rome: the player must roll the dice and try to get to Rome to receive a big win\nWild Power Spins: three free spins available, during which the centurion will drop Wild symbols on the reels to increase winnings.\n        ",
