Try the slot machine Age of the Gods: Norse King of Asgard by Playtech and immerse yourself in this mysterious realm ruled by the gods, which could reward you with a precious progressive jackpot.\n\nWhat is the game structure of this mythological slot?\n\nThe online slot Age of the Gods: Norse King of Asgard has six reels and 50 paylines. Load the game on your PC or mobile phone and you will be immediately transported inside a huge castle atop a mountain, surrounded by rosy clouds at sunset. The 5x3 symbol grid is framed in a Viking-themed border. As you would expect from a Playtech slot machine, the game is accompanied by an impactful soundtrack. You can start betting from €0.10 up to €500.00 per spin if you are a Prof. Playtech. Playtech does not disclose the actual RTP, but you can expect to receive a long-term refund of about 95%.\n\nDiscover the valuable Gifts of the Gods now!\n\nThe six-reel configuration means that during regular play, you must land three or more identical symbols on a payline to win prizes. Which symbols pay the most?\n\n- Runes pay up to 80 times your line bet\n- The Snake and the Raven are both valued up to 150x\n- Wolves and Frost Giants each return between five and 250 times, depending on the number of reels\n- Thor is the most rewarding symbol, worth up to 400 times your line bet.\n\nLoki and Odin are two wild symbols to keep an eye on!\n\nYou have two wild symbols to help you. Both pay like Thor. The mischievous Loki is a standard-sized symbol, while Odin is much more powerful. This aging god is four rows high and can potentially fill entire reels of the slot. Odin fully stacked on any reel triggers the Odin's Fury Respins Bonus feature. Loki, on the other hand, is useful during the Odin's Fins Respins round.
