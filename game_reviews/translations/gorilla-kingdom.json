    "original_text": "\nGorilla Kingdom\nAmbientata nella giungla, Gorilla Kingdom ha una grafica di alta qualità e animazioni di livello superiore che raramente ci è capitato di trovare in una slot machine. Grazie al comparto grafico il gioco risulta essere realistico e coinvolgente. A far da sfondo a questa slot machine c’è la giungla selvaggia, con le sue foglie verdissime, grandi fiori rossi e una cascata di acqua cristallina. In sottofondo il suono dell’acqua che scorre e quello di tamburi e flauti ci accompagnerà per tutto il gioco, a meno che non si ottenga una combinazione vincente con il simbolo del gorilla. In tal caso il suo verso terrificante risuonerà per tutta la foresta!\nNella parte bassa dello schermo troviamo i riquadri con le informazioni sulla puntata, il valore dei gettoni, il tasto Autoplay e quello per giocare manualmente. Dalle impostazioni è possibile attivare anche l’opzione giri veloci per aumentare la velocità di rotazione dei rulli, oltre ad altre funzioni da settare a nostro piacimento.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot\nGorilla Kingdom è dotata di una griglia 5×4 anziché la tradizionale 5X3, con una volatilità media e un ritorno teorico al giocatore (RTP) pari al 96,03%, pienamente in linea con le altre slot machine. A rendere speciale questo gioco però non sono le sole animazioni e una grafica curata in ogni dettaglio, ma anche e soprattutto le linee di pagamento, che sono ben 1.024. Ciò vuol dire che si può arrivare a guadagnare sino a ben 2.857 il valore della giocata! Le puntate vanno da un minimo di 0,10 € a un massimo di 350 € per giro.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Gorilla Kingdom\nI simboli presenti in Gorilla Kingdom si dividono in tematici e non tematici. I non tematici, che hanno anche il valore più basso, sono quelli classici delle carte da gioco dal 10 all’asso. I simboli tematici sono invece quelli che pagano di più. Tra essi ricordiamo il leopardo, il pangolino, l’okapi e gli uccelli buceri, oltre naturalmente al gorilla che assicura in assoluto i premi più alti.\nNon è presente il simbolo Wild, ma c’è una funzione bonus extra legata allo Scatter. Lo Scatter è rappresentato da una grande pietra preziosa azzurra. Se compare per almeno 3 volte si attivano i Free Spins, da un minimo di 10 a un massimo di 20. Durante i giri gratuiti se riappaiono due o più Scatter, si ha diritto a ulteriori Free Spins. Anche in questo caso il valore massimo è di 20 giri gratuiti.\nCiò che rende questa slot diversa da tutte le altre è però la funzione “Symbol Transform” che si può attivarsi durante i Free Spins. Se sui rulli appare la maschera del gorilla, allora il gioco si blocca, la maschera rotola fuori dalla griglia di gioco e va a riempire una statua totem dove si trovano degli spazi vuoti che dovranno essere riempite con le immagini degli altri animali. Quando la statua sarà completa, tutti le icone degli animali si trasformeranno nel gorilla e arriveranno vincite molte sostanziose.\n",

Thanks to the graphic design, the game is realistic and engaging. The backdrop of this slot machine is the wild jungle, with its lush green leaves, big red flowers, and a crystal-clear waterfall. In the background, the sound of flowing water and drum and flute music will accompany us throughout the game, unless we get a winning combination with the gorilla symbol. In that case, its terrifying roar will echo throughout the forest!\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, we find the boxes with information on the bet, token value, autoplay button, and manual play button. From the settings, we can also activate the option for fast spins to increase the speed of the reels, as well as other features to set according to our preferences.\n\nKey Features of the slot\nGorilla Kingdom has a 5x4 grid instead of the traditional 5x3, with medium volatility and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.03%, fully in line with other slot machines. However, what makes this game special is not only the animations and detailed graphics but also, above all, the paylines, which are a whopping 1,024. This means that you can earn up to 2,857 times the bet's value! The bet ranges from a minimum of €0.10 to a maximum of €350 per spin.\n\nSymbols and features of Gorilla Kingdom\nThe symbols in Gorilla Kingdom are divided into thematic and non-thematic. The non-thematic symbols, which also have the lowest value, are the classic playing card symbols from 10 to ace. The thematic symbols instead are the ones that pay the most. Among them, we remember the leopard, the pangolin, the okapi, and the hornbill birds, as well as, of course, the gorilla that ensures the highest prizes.\n\nThere is no Wild symbol, but there is an extra bonus feature linked to the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by a large blue gemstone. If it appears at least three times, Free Spins are activated, ranging from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 20. During Free Spins, if two or more Scatters reappear, additional Free Spins are granted. Again, the maximum value is 20 Free Spins.\n\nWhat sets this slot apart from all others, however, is the \"Symbol Transform\" feature that can be activated during the Free Spins. If the gorilla mask appears on the reels, then the game stops, the mask rolls out of the grid, and fills a totem pole statue where there are empty spaces that need to be filled with images of other animals. When the statue is complete, all animal icons transform into gorillas, leading to substantial winnings.",

Thanks to the graphics, the game is realistic and engaging. The backdrop of this slot machine is the wild jungle, with its lush green leaves, large red flowers, and a cascade of crystal clear water. In the background, the sound of water flowing and the beat of drums and flutes will accompany us throughout the game, unless we hit a winning combination with the gorilla symbol.

From the settings, it is also possible to activate the fast spin option to increase the speed of the reels, as well as other functions to set according to our preferences.\nMain features of the slot\nGorilla Kingdom has a 5×4 grid instead of the traditional 5X3, with medium volatility and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.03%, fully in line with other slot machines. However, what makes this game special is not only the animations and the detailed graphics but also and above all the paylines, which are a whopping 1,024. This means that you can earn up to 2,857 times the value of your bet! Bets range from a minimum of 0.10 € to a maximum of 350 € per spin.\nSymbols and features of Gorilla Kingdom\nThe symbols in Gorilla Kingdom are divided into thematic and non-thematic. The non-thematic symbols, which also have the lowest value, are the classic 10 to Ace playing cards. The thematic symbols are instead the ones that pay the most. Among them, we remember the leopard, the pangolin, the okapi, and the hornbill birds, in addition to the gorilla, which provides the highest prizes.\nThere is no Wild symbol, but there is an extra bonus function related to the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by a large blue gemstone. If it appears at least 3 times, Free Spins are activated, from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 20. During the free spins, if two or more Scatters reappear, additional Free Spins are awarded. Even in this case, the maximum value is 20 free spins.\nWhat makes this slot machine different from all the others, however, is the \"Symbol Transform\" function that can be activated during Free Spins. If the gorilla mask appears on the reels, the game stops, the mask rolls out of the game grid, and fills a totem pole statue with empty spaces that need to be filled with images of other animals. When the statue is complete, all animal icons will transform into gorillas, leading to substantial wins.\n            ",

Gorilla Kingdom is a visually stunning game that offers a unique and immersive jungle adventure. That being said, some players might be more interested in the possible payouts – and we’ve got you covered.</p>\n\n                <p>Let's start by exploring the symbols of the Gorilla Kingdom. The non-thematic symbols might not be jungle creatures, but they are still important as they have a direct effect on your winnings. These classics include playing cards ranging from 10 to Ace, and while they don't offer the greatest payouts, they’re enough to keep you in the game. However, if you’re looking for the big bucks, you’ll want to land the thematic symbols. These include a stunning leopard, a curious pangolin, an adorable okapi, beautiful hornbill birds, and – of course – the gorilla. The gorilla is the symbol to look out for, as it provides the highest payout. Just one of these noble creatures is enough to earn big bucks, but the more you land, the more bananas you’ll earn.</p>\n\n                <p>Unfortunately, there is no Wild symbol in this jungle adventure – but don't get too upset. It’s more than made up for with the scatter symbol, represented by a dazzling blue gemstone. This Scatter can activate Free Spins when you land 3 or more on the reels. The more Scatters you land, the more Free Spins you will receive. Even better, the game offers a minimum of 10 – but the max amount of Free Spins available is 20. So, keep your eyes peeled for those stunning blue gems.</p>\n\n                <p>If you're looking for a reason to play Gorilla Kingdom, the maximum win value is 2,857x your initial bet – which is certainly nothing to sniff at. But keep in mind that slots are unpredictable (just like a gorilla's mood). Sometimes they’re feeling generous and will reward you with great payouts, while other times they will leave you feeling defeated.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and Features\n\nGorilla Kingdom is a 5×4 grid slot machine with 1,024 paylines and medium volatility, offering a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.03%. The game can be played with a minimum bet of 0.10 € and a maximum of 350 € per spin. It also has a fast spin option and other functions for customization purposes, such as Autoplay and manual play.\n\nSymbol Values and Payouts\n\nThe symbols in Gorilla Kingdom are divided into non-thematic and thematic categories. The non-thematic symbols are the classic playing cards from 10 to Ace and have the lowest value. The thematic symbols include the leopard, the pangolin, the okapi, the hornbill birds, and the gorilla, which provides the highest payout. There is no Wild symbol, but there is a Scatter represented by a blue gemstone. The Scatter can activate Free Spins, with a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 20. The slot machine has a 2,857x maximum win value.\n\nFree Spins and Bonus Features\n\nGorilla Kingdom offers a Free Spins bonus feature that is activated when three or more blue gemstone Scatters appear on the reels. The player can win up to 20 free spins. During the Free Spins, if two or more Scatters reappear, the player can earn additional Free Spins. The Symbol Transform function is another bonus feature in the game. It is activated during Free Spins when a gorilla mask appears on the reels, and it can lead to substantial wins. During this feature, the mask rolls out of the game grid and fills a totem pole statue with empty spaces that require images of other animals. Once the statue is complete, all animal icons will transform into gorillas.\n\nCustomization Options and Bet Sizes\n\nGorilla Kingdom provides customization options for the player, including the Autoplay and manual play buttons, and a fast spin option to increase the speed of the reels. The player can choose to place bets with a minimum of 0.10 € and a maximum of 350 € per spin. These options make the slot game suitable for both low and high rollers.\n\nGraphics, Animations, and Sound Effects\n\nGorilla Kingdom features high-quality graphics, animations, and sound effects that immerse the player in the jungle. The game's backdrop is a lush green jungle with crystal clear waterfalls, and the sound of water and drums and flutes accompanies the game unless a winning combination with the gorilla symbol appears that triggers a terrifying roar. The detailed animations of the symbols and the colorful graphics make the game engaging and realistic, and the absence of a Wild symbol is offset by the unique bonus features.\n\n        \n            ",

Thanks to the graphics, the game is realistic and engaging. The backdrop of this slot machine is the wild jungle, with its lush green leaves, large red flowers, and a cascade of crystal clear water. In the background, the sound of water flowing and the beat of drums and flutes will accompany us throughout the game, unless we hit a winning combination with the gorilla symbol. In that case, its terrifying roar will resonate throughout the forest!\nAt the bottom of the screen, we find the boxes with information about the bet, the value of the coins, the Autoplay button, and the button to play manually. From the settings, it is also possible to activate the fast spin option to increase the speed of the reels, as well as other functions to set according to our preferences.\nMain features of the slot\nGorilla Kingdom has a 5×4 grid instead of the traditional 5X3, with medium volatility and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.03%, fully in line with other slot machines. However, what makes this game special is not only the animations and the detailed graphics but also and above all the paylines, which are a whopping 1,024. This means that you can earn up to 2,857 times the value of your bet! Bets range from a minimum of 0.10 € to a maximum of 350 € per spin.\nSymbols and features of Gorilla Kingdom\nThe symbols in Gorilla Kingdom are divided into thematic and non-thematic. The non-thematic symbols, which also have the lowest value, are the classic 10 to Ace playing cards. The thematic symbols are instead the ones that pay the most. Among them, we remember the leopard, the pangolin, the okapi, and the hornbill birds, in addition to the gorilla, which provides the highest prizes.\nThere is no Wild symbol, but there is an extra bonus function related to the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by a large blue gemstone. If it appears at least 3 times, Free Spins are activated, from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 20. During the free spins, if two or more Scatters reappear, additional Free Spins are awarded. Even in this case, the maximum value is 20 free spins.\nWhat makes this slot machine different from all the others, however, is the \"Symbol Transform\" function that can be activated during Free Spins. If the gorilla mask appears on the reels, the game stops, the mask rolls out of the game grid, and fills a totem pole statue with empty spaces that need to be filled with images of other animals. When the statue is complete, all animal icons will transform into gorillas, leading to substantial wins.\n            ",

Thanks to the graphics, the game is realistic and engaging. The backdrop of this slot machine is the wild jungle, with its lush green leaves, large red flowers, and a cascade of crystal clear water. In the background, the sound of water flowing and the beat of drums and flutes will accompany us throughout the game, unless we hit a winning combination with the gorilla symbol. In that case, its terrifying roar will resonate throughout the forest!\nAt the bottom of the screen, we find the boxes with information about the bet, the value of the coins, the Autoplay button, and the button to play manually. From the settings, it is also possible to activate the fast spin option to increase the speed of the reels, as well as other functions to set according to our preferences.\nMain features of the slot\nGorilla Kingdom has a 5×4 grid instead of the traditional 5X3, with medium volatility and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.03%, fully in line with other slot machines. However, what makes this game special is not only the animations and the detailed graphics but also and above all the paylines, which are a whopping 1,024. This means that you can earn up to 2,857 times the value of your bet! Bets range from a minimum of 0.10 € to a maximum of 350 € per spin.\nSymbols and features of Gorilla Kingdom\nThe symbols in Gorilla Kingdom are divided into thematic and non-thematic. The non-thematic symbols, which also have the lowest value, are the classic 10 to Ace playing cards. The thematic symbols are instead the ones that pay the most. Among them, we remember the leopard, the pangolin, the okapi, and the hornbill birds, in addition to the gorilla, which provides the highest prizes.\nThere is no Wild symbol, but there is an extra bonus function related to the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by a large blue gemstone. If it appears at least 3 times, Free Spins are activated, from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 20. During the free spins, if two or more Scatters reappear, additional Free Spins are awarded. Even in this case, the maximum value is 20 free spins.\nWhat makes this slot machine different from all the others, however, is the \"Symbol Transform\" function that can be activated during Free Spins. If the gorilla mask appears on the reels, the game stops, the mask rolls out of the game grid, and fills a totem pole statue with empty spaces that need to be filled with images of other animals. When the statue is complete, all animal icons will transform into gorillas, leading to substantial wins.\n            ",
