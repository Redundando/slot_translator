Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGraphics\n\n1 Left Alive has some of the best graphics on the market. The game engine is incredibly realistic, with changing backgrounds like a dark forest with blue-black tones. The symbols are also carefully designed with the Poker letters and zombie images that allow you to win money.\n\nPaylines\n\nWith 1,024 paylines and an incredible feature called Ways + Game Engine, which includes a cascade function, players can enjoy even more opportunities to win. The cascade feature means that 1 Left Alive doesn't only have 1,024 paylines but up to a maximum of 32,768. These numbers are extraordinary for a 5x4 grid.\n\nPayout Percentage\n\n1 Left Alive has an impressively high payout percentage estimated at 97%. This number is much higher than the average of 95.5% to 96% in most other online slot games. This feature is why 1 Left Alive is one of the most winning slots on the market.\n\nSpecial Symbols/Features\n\nThe Bloody Wild symbol is crucial in this slot and transforms every zombie on the grid into a Scatter symbol. The Scatter symbol remains and only scrolls down until it leaves the last reel, and this triggers a bonus of up to 700 free spins. The Ways + Game Engine in 1 Left Alive implements a cascade function, which means getting winning combinations on the first reel; the feature allows symbols to slide down and create other winning combinations, increasing opportunities for more significant wins.\n\nAlternative Recommendations\n\nFor those who love zombies, another recommendation is the Walking Dead Slot Game 2, produced by Aristocrat. The graphics are stunning, and users can play with all the main characters of the series and try to win the progressive jackpot starting at $500,000.\n\n        \n            ",

There is increasing fear among the population that, due to some virus, people could be transformed into zombies and begin to populate the Earth.\n\nYggdrasil is very aware of this social problem, which is why they decided to create a slot machine on the topic. We can assure you that it was made solely to raise awareness about the zombie issue!\n\nContinue reading to find out more.\n\nOne of the Best Graphics on the Market\n\nThe zombie apocalypse story may or may not be your cup of tea, but one thing is objectively correct and all users agree on it: 1 Left Alive produced by Yggdrasil is one of the best graphic slot machines on the market.\n\nImagine being the last person on Earth and having to fight against the undead. Yggdrasil has tried to give the same exhilarating feeling thanks to an incredible and realistic game engine.\n\nLater on, we'll talk about the special features that make this 5x4 grid one of the most winning on the market. For now, we can say that the background is not always the same, but changes with the scenarios. You could find yourself in a dark forest with blue-black tones, or inside a room surrounded by thousands of zombies.\n\nThe symbols are carefully designed, from the J, Q, K and Ace Poker letters to the images of zombies that allow you to win a lot of money.\n\nBut to know all the functions, you have to keep reading!\n\nThe Winning Features of this Slot\n\nWe told you that Yggdrasil's 1 Left Alive is one of the most winning slot machines on the market. Although the grid is a classic 5x4, you should know that there are 1,024 paylines. But not only that! This slot machine, in fact, has an incredible feature called Ways + Game Engine, which we can summarize as \"cascade function\". Getting winning combinations on the first reel, in fact, the symbols slide down and other winning combinations can be created with those that were already there. This means that 1 Left Alive doesn't have only 1,024 paylines, but up to a maximum of 32,768!\n\nThese are incredible numbers that should be compensated by a low RTP. Instead, looking at what the payout is estimated at, you'll read a whopping 97%, a number considerably higher than the average, which usually hovers around 95.5% to 96%.\n\nWhat else can we say? We told you that this is one of the most winning slots on the market!\n\nA very important symbol is the Bloody Wild, which allows you to transform every zombie on the grid into a Scatter, which does not disappear after a single play but only scrolls down until it exits the last reel. In this way, you can win up to 700 free spins.\n\nAnother similar slot machine\n\nIf you're a zombie fan, we can only recommend the Walking Dead Slot Game 2. It is one of the most beautiful graphically speaking on the market, and it was produced by Aristocrat. You can play with all the main characters of the series and try to win the progressive jackpot starting at $500,000.\n            ",

This slot machine, in fact, has an incredible feature called Ways + Game Engine, which we can summarize as \"cascade function\". Getting winning combinations on the first reel, in fact, the symbols slide down and other winning combinations can be created with those that were already there. This means that 1 Left Alive doesn't have only 1,024 paylines, but up to a maximum of 32,768!\n\nThese are incredible numbers that should be compensated by a low RTP. Instead, looking at what the payout is estimated at, you'll read a whopping 97%, a number considerably higher than the average, which usually hovers around 95.5% to 96%.\n\nWhat else can we say? We told you that this is one of the most winning slots on the market!\n\nA very important symbol is the Bloody Wild, which allows you to transform every zombie on the grid into a Scatter, which does not disappear after a single play but only scrolls down until it exits the last reel. In this way, you can win up to 700 free spins.\n\nAnother similar slot machine\n\nIf you're a zombie fan, we can only recommend the Walking Dead Slot Game 2. It is one of the most beautiful graphically speaking on the market, and it was produced by Aristocrat. You can play with all the main characters of the series and try to win the progressive jackpot starting at $500,000.\n            ",
