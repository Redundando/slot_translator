It's not just their external appearance that draws people, it's their meaning of wealth. In the past, vivid rubies were think of as being set in crowns worn by kings and queens. Nowadays, diamonds can be found on expensive watches worn by wealthy men or shining rings worn by Hollywood stars. \n\nExtra Wild by Merkur allows us to experience a bit of this luxury and wealth with its gem-themed slot. Let's start our review by looking at its graphical part.\n\nExtra Wild - Graphics\n\nThe game board of Extra Wild seems to be placed on a background of blue velvet. The board design is simple, probably to highlight the slot symbols, or because simplicity has become a hallmark of Merkur slots. \n\nExtra Wild wants to stand out from other slots by eliminating the classic playing card symbols and replacing them with entirely original symbols that refer to the theme of wealth and precious stones.

But it's not just their outer appearance that attracts people so much, but their significance of wealth.\nIn the past, it was easy to think of vivid rubies set in the crowns of kings and queens. Now, diamonds can be found on expensive watches worn by wealthy men or brilliant rings worn by world stars.\nExtra Wild from Merkur lets us experience a little bit of this luxury and wealth with its gem-themed slot game. Let's start our review by focusing on its visual aspect.\nExtra Wild - Graphics\nThe game grid of Extra Wild seems to lie on a background of blue velvet. The grid aims for simplicity, probably to highlight the slot's symbols or even because simplicity itself has become a trademark of Merkur's slot games.\nExtra Wild wants to stand out from many other slots, eliminating the classic playing card symbols and replacing them with entirely original symbols that refer to the theme of wealth and precious gemstones.\nWe will indeed find bags full of coins, gold coins, pocket watches, shiny diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and the heart-shaped gold medallion. The illustrations of these symbols are just as simple and graphic, sacrificing detail to be recognizable at a glance by players.\nSimplicity can often be a double-edged sword. It's not easy to represent something in an essential way without appearing bare, but in this case, even though Merkur doesn't excel artistically compared to other slots, it still succeeds in its intent.\nLet's move on to the next point of the review to talk about its more technical aspect.\nExtra Wild - Technical Features\nLet's move on to the technical sector of this slot game: on paper, we are faced with a decidedly classic slot game. The five reels and three lines along which the symbols of the various games are arranged create a grid of the 5*3 type that is very common among online titles.\nThere are 10 paylines, not very many but sufficient to have a decent number of wins (usually, you will see several rounds without any wins and then get more combinations in the same round).\nOne of the most interesting functions, as suggested by the title of the slot game, is the Wild symbol: represented by the door of a safe or more precisely by a vault, the symbol will hide behind it a multiplier on the wins that will allow you to obtain combinations of greater value.\nAs a Wild symbol, in fact, it can replace any other symbol in the game and function as a wild card. There aren't many other special features, giving this slot game a rather linear but not boring gameplay.\nSlot games similar to Extra Wild\nThe theme of jewels is very popular among online slot games, and therefore it's easy to find many titles on them. Among the many, we recommend slot games like Jewel Box, Diamonds, Jewels World, Gems & Stones, and the alluring 7 Sins.\n            ",

The game has a rather linear but not boring gameplay, and players can enjoy the Wild symbol's unique feature that hides behind it a multiplier on the wins that allows for greater value combinations.\n\nWild Symbol Feature\n\nIn Extra Wild, the Wild symbol is represented by the door of a safe or vault and functions as a wild card that can replace any other symbol in the game. The symbol's unique feature is its hidden multiplier, which can increase the value of the wins considerably.\n\nGame Grid and Theme\n\nThe game grid of Extra Wild features a blue velvet background and aims for simplicity to highlight the slot's symbols. The symbols themselves are original and refer to the theme of wealth and precious gemstones, with bags of coins, gold coins, pocket watches, shiny diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and a heart-shaped gold medallion. The illustrations of these symbols are graphic and recognizable at a glance by players.\n\nPaylines\n\nExtra Wild features 10 paylines, which is not a lot compared to some other online slot games. However, it's sufficient to have a decent number of wins, with several rounds without any wins followed by more combinations in the same round.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nThe theme of jewels is popular among online slot games, and there are many titles on the theme. Similar games to Extra Wild include Jewel Box, Diamonds, Jewels World, Gems & Stones, and 7 Sins.\n\n        \n            ",

But it's not just their outer appearance that attracts people so much, but their significance of wealth.\nIn the past, it was easy to think of vivid rubies set in the crowns of kings and queens. Now, diamonds can be found on expensive watches worn by wealthy men or brilliant rings worn by world stars.\nExtra Wild from Merkur lets us experience a little bit of this luxury and wealth with its gem-themed slot game. Let's start our review by focusing on its visual aspect.\nExtra Wild - Graphics\nThe game grid of Extra Wild seems to lie on a background of blue velvet. The grid aims for simplicity, probably to highlight the slot's symbols or even because simplicity itself has become a trademark of Merkur's slot games.\nExtra Wild wants to stand out from many other slots, eliminating the classic playing card symbols and replacing them with entirely original symbols that refer to the theme of wealth and precious gemstones.\nWe will indeed find bags full of coins, gold coins, pocket watches, shiny diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and the heart-shaped gold medallion. The illustrations of these symbols are just as simple and graphic, sacrificing detail to be recognizable at a glance by players.\nSimplicity can often be a double-edged sword. It's not easy to represent something in an essential way without appearing bare, but in this case, even though Merkur doesn't excel artistically compared to other slots, it still succeeds in its intent.\nLet's move on to the next point of the review to talk about its more technical aspect.\nExtra Wild - Technical Features\nLet's move on to the technical sector of this slot game: on paper, we are faced with a decidedly classic slot game. The five reels and three lines along which the symbols of the various games are arranged create a grid of the 5*3 type that is very common among online titles.\nThere are 10 paylines, not very many but sufficient to have a decent number of wins (usually, you will see several rounds without any wins and then get more combinations in the same round).\nOne of the most interesting functions, as suggested by the title of the slot game, is the Wild symbol: represented by the door of a safe or more precisely by a vault, the symbol will hide behind it a multiplier on the wins that will allow you to obtain combinations of greater value.\nAs a Wild symbol, in fact, it can replace any other symbol in the game and function as a wild card. There aren't many other special features, giving this slot game a rather linear but not boring gameplay.\nSlot games similar to Extra Wild\nThe theme of jewels is very popular among online slot games, and therefore it's easy to find many titles on them. Among the many, we recommend slot games like Jewel Box, Diamonds, Jewels World, Gems & Stones, and the alluring 7 Sins.\n        ",

The warrior should be standing on a treasure chest overflowing with precious gems, gold coins, and diamond-encrusted watches. The warrior should be holding a large diamond in one hand and flashing a winning grin, indicating the success players can achieve in the game. The background should have a blue velvet texture, similar to that of the game grid, to tie in the game's visual aspect. Overall, the image should evoke feelings of luxury, wealth, and success, fitting for a game about precious gemstones."
