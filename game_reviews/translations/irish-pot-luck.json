The Leprechaun, a fairy shoemaker with his pot of coins, is the main character. The graphics are inspired by Irish traditions with an Irish landscape in the background. The symbols are all themed, and apart from the four card suits, other symbols include a pipe, the Leprechaun's hat, a harp, and a horseshoe.\n\nSpecial Features and Jackpots\n\nIrish Pot Luck's gameplay includes a few special features, such as Wilds and Scatters, along with three types of Jackpots. The Wild symbol is represented by a coin with the letter \"W\" engraved on it, while the Scatter, a rainbow, appears on reels 1, 3, and 5, and awards 10 Free Spins with possible re-triggers. The Jackpot symbol with the inevitable four-leaf clover is the key to win one of the three different Jackpots available in the game. During free spins, the Jackpot symbols can activate the Jackpot Wheel feature, which will award multipliers and Mega Jackpot of 5,000 times the value of the bet.\n\nGame Grid and Betting Range\n\nIrish Pot Luck is a classic slot machine with five reels, three rows, and twenty paylines. The betting range of Irish Pot Luck is quite wide, starting from a minimum of 20 cents (one cent each line) to a maximum of €200. Players can test the game with the demo version and enjoy the gameplay without spending a penny.\n\nDemo Version and RTP\n\nIrish Pot Luck offers a demo version for players who want to try the game before betting with real money. The slot machine's theoretical return to the player (RTP) is around 96.06%, which is average compared to other slot machines.\n\nFree Spins and Jackpot Wheel Feature\n\nIrish Pot Luck's Free Spins round can be triggered by landing three Scatters on the reels. During Free Spins, it's possible to re-trigger the same feature. The Jackpot Wheel feature is activated when three Jackpot symbols land on reels 1, 3, and 5. It will make the fortune wheel spin and award various prizes, including multipliers and one of the three Jackpots available in the game.\n\n        \n            ",

One of the most iconic figures in Ireland is undoubtedly the Leprechaun, a mischievous yet friendly elf! Dressed in green, with a red beard and hair and a large hat on his head, the Leprechaun is the shoemaker of the fairies, and thanks to this work earns a small fortune, which he keeps in a pot hidden at the base of the rainbow.\n\nIrish Pot Luck, the new slot machine produced by NetEnt, draws inspiration from the figure of the Leprechaun and his pot of coins. The entire graphics of Irish Pot Luck is a tribute to Irish traditions, starting from the background that represents a typical Irish landscape, with blue skies and green fields, to the game symbols and, of course, the Leprechaun who throws gold coins to the left of the reels.\n\nGameplay\nIrish Pot Luck is a slot machine with a rather traditional look, but it hides an unexpected gameplay, with several special features and the possibility of getting your hands on three types of Jackpots. The game grid is very simple, with five reels, three rows, and only twenty paylines. The betting range of Irish Pot Luck is very wide, from a minimum of 20 cents (one cent each line) to a maximum of €200. Of course, you can practice the game for free without registering with the demo version!\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of Irish Pot Luck is average, with a good 96.06%.\n\nSymbols and Special Features\nThe regular symbols on the reels of Irish Pot Luck, except for the four card suits, are all themed and include a pipe, the Leprechaun's hat, a harp, and a horseshoe. As for the special symbols, there's the Wild, represented by a coin with the letter W engraved, the Scatter, which is a rainbow, and the Jackpot symbol with the inevitable four-leaf clover.\n\nThe Scatter appears only on reels 1, 3, and 5, and in the regular game, it gives 10 Free Spins, plus 10 more if it reappears during the free spins.\n\nThe Jackpot symbols also appear only on reels 1, 3, and 5 and during the free spins, they activate the Jackpot Wheel feature, a fortune wheel that awards various prizes, including multipliers, and the chance to get your hands on the Mega Jackpot, which will make you win 5,000 times the value of the bet!\n        ",
