Questa festa affonda le sue radici in una curiosa leggenda. Infatti, si narra che una terribile creatura chiama Nian, con l’arrivo della bella stagione si svegliasse per mangiare. Il cibo, neanche a dirlo, erano esseri umani. L’unica difesa contro il mostro erano il colore rosso e i rumori forti, di cui era terrorizzato.\nAnche in Moon Dancer il colore predominante è il rosso e i simboli si rifanno tutti alla tradizione cinese. La grafica è ben calibrata, ricca di dettagli e con qualche animazione niente male. Nascoste dietro la griglia di gioco ci sono due ruote di cui possiamo scorrerne solo la metà. Durante gli spin queste ruote girano, mostrandoci i premi a cui possiamo ambire. In quella di sinistra sono segnalati i bonus e i moltiplicatori, in quella di destra i jackpot.\nNella parte sottostante ci sono tasti per giocare e quelli per settare al meglio la scommessa. La musica neanche a dirlo è orientaleggiante, rilassante al punto giusto.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia di gioco ha 5 rulli e 3 righe e ci sono 50 linee di pagamento su cui è possibile puntare minimo 1 €. La puntata massima è invece di 20 € e può essere impostata in un colpo solo cliccando sul pulsante Max. Si possono attivare sino a un massimo di 100 giri automatici.\nIl valore RTP non è molto alto essendo pari al 94,74%, mentre la volatilità è alta.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nIn questa slot abbiamo 5 simboli di basso valore e 5 di alto valore. Quelli che pagano meno sono le carte da gioco, dopodiché troviamo la lanterna, il fiore di loto, l’ideogramma e infine la sycee dorata, simbolo di ricchezza. La ragazza in abiti tradizionali è il nostro Wild e può apparire anche esteso, e va a sostituire tutti i simboli eccetto quelli speciali.\nDurante il gioco regolare, se compaiono 5 o più simboli Wheel Bonanza, si attiva una funzione bonus.

This festivity has its roots in a curious legend. In fact, it is said that a terrible creature called Nian would wake up to eat with the arrival of the beautiful season. The food, needless to say, was humans. The only defense against the monster were the color red and loud noises which he was terrified of.\nEven in Moon Dancer, the predominant color is red and the symbols all refer to Chinese tradition. The graphics are well calibrated, rich in detail and with some nice animations. Hidden behind the game grid, there are two wheels of which we can only see half of.

On the left side Jackpots and multipliers are highlighted, on the right side the bonus wheel.\nOn the bottom, there are buttons to play and those to best set the bet. The music is oriental but relaxing at the right point.\nSlot Features\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 3 rows and there are 50 paylines where you can bet a minimum of 1 €. The maximum bet is 20 € and can be set all at once by clicking on the Max button. Up to a maximum of 100 automatic spins can be activated.\nThe RTP value is not very high, being equal to 94.74%, while the volatility is high.\nSymbols and Features\nIn this slot there are 5 low value symbols and 5 high value ones. The ones that pay the least are the playing cards, followed by the lantern, the lotus flower, the ideogram and finally the golden sycee, symbol of wealth.

This celebration has its roots in a curious legend. It is said that a terrible creature called Nian woke up with the arrival of the beautiful season only to eat. The food, needless to say, was humans. The only defense against the monster was the color red and loud noises, which terrified it.\n\nIn Moon Dancer, the predominant color is red and all symbols refer to Chinese tradition. The graphics are well calibrated, rich in detail, and with some decent animations. Behind the game grid, there are two wheels of which we can only see half. During the spins, these wheels spin, showing us the prizes we can aspire to. The left one indicates the bonuses and multipliers, while the right one shows the jackpots.\n\nAt the bottom, there are buttons to play and those to set the bet best. The music, needless to say, is oriental-inspired, relaxing at the right point.\n\nSlot features:\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, and there are 50 paylines on which to bet at least 1 €. The maximum bet is instead 20 € and can be set in one fell swoop by clicking on the Max button. You can activate up to a maximum of 100 automatic spins. \n\nThe RTP value is not very high, being equal to 94.74%, while the volatility is high.\n\nSymbols and functionalities:\nIn this slot, we have 5 low-value symbols and 5 high-value ones. Those that pay the least are the playing cards, then we find the lantern, the lotus flower, the ideogram, and finally the golden sycee, a symbol of wealth. The girl in traditional dress is our Wild and can also appear extended, replacing all symbols except the special ones.\n\nDuring regular play, if 5 or more Wheel Bonanza symbols appear, a bonus feature is activated. In this case, the left wheel will move and replace the game grid. It is divided into segments on which numerous prizes are indicated, from multipliers to free spins, to sums of money.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame Overview and Features\n\nMoon Dancer is a Chinese-themed online slot game that celebrates the New Year festive season. The game has 5 reels, 3 rows, and 50 paylines. The game has a unique feature where two wheels behind the game grid spin, showing the prizes that can be won; the left wheel indicates bonuses and multipliers, while the right wheel shows the jackpots. The game is set to relaxing oriental-inspired music.\n\nSymbols and Wilds\n\nMoon Dancer has a total of 10 symbols, which include 5 low-value symbols, and 5 high-value ones. The low-value symbols are playing cards, while the high-value symbols are the lantern, the lotus flower, the ideogram, the golden sycee, and a girl in traditional dress that acts as the Wild symbol. The Wild symbol substitutes all other symbols except the special ones. During regular play, if 5 or more Wheel Bonanza symbols appear, a bonus feature is activated. There are 3 different extended Wild symbols with multipliers of 2x, 3x, and 5x. The blue temple symbol during Free Spins adds an additional 3 spins and multipliers.\n\nBonus features\n\nDuring regular play, if 5 or more Wheel Bonanza symbols appear, a bonus feature is activated. In this case, the left wheel replaces the game grid and is divided into segments that indicate numerous prizes from multipliers to free spins to sums of money.

This celebration has its roots in a curious legend. It is said that a terrible creature called Nian woke up with the arrival of the beautiful season only to eat. The food, needless to say, was humans. The only defense against the monster was the color red and loud noises, which terrified it.\n\nIn Moon Dancer, the predominant color is red and all symbols refer to Chinese tradition. The graphics are well calibrated, rich in detail, and with some decent animations. Behind the game grid, there are two wheels of which we can only see half. During the spins, these wheels spin, showing us the prizes we can aspire to. The left one indicates the bonuses and multipliers, while the right one shows the jackpots.\n\nAt the bottom, there are buttons to play and those to set the bet best. The music, needless to say, is oriental-inspired, relaxing at the right point.\n\nSlot features:\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, and there are 50 paylines on which to bet at least 1 €. The maximum bet is instead 20 € and can be set in one fell swoop by clicking on the Max button. You can activate up to a maximum of 100 automatic spins. \n\nThe RTP value is not very high, being equal to 94.74%, while the volatility is high.\n\nSymbols and functionalities:\nIn this slot, we have 5 low-value symbols and 5 high-value ones. Those that pay the least are the playing cards, then we find the lantern, the lotus flower, the ideogram, and finally the golden sycee, a symbol of wealth. The girl in traditional dress is our Wild and can also appear extended, replacing all symbols except the special ones.\n\nDuring regular play, if 5 or more Wheel Bonanza symbols appear, a bonus feature is activated. In this case, the left wheel will move and replace the game grid. It is divided into segments on which numerous prizes are indicated, from multipliers to free spins, to sums of money. The wheel will spin until it stops on the corresponding symbol.\n\nDuring Free Spins, the blue temple symbol adds an additional 3 spins and multipliers.\nThree different extended Wilds can appear on reel 3, accompanied by multipliers of 2x, 3x, or 5x.\nIf the word jackpot appears, then it will be the right wheel to emerge from behind the game grid. \n\nThere are 4 types of jackpots available. These are the amounts: \n\nMini, equal to 250 € \nMinor, equal to 500 € \nMajor, equal to 5,000 € \nGrand, equal to 50,000 €\n        ",
