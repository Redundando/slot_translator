Dopo il successo nazionale che ha avuto questa slot, non ha sorpreso veder nascere slot simili o veri e propri seguiti spirituali.\nNe è un esempio Fowl Play London della stessa casa di sviluppo: la gallina quindi si veste come Sherlock Holmes e assume così un retrogusto inglese. In questa breve recensione andremo ad analizzarla nel dettaglio mettendola a confronto con il titolo precedente.\n\nFowl Play London: comparto visivo\nL’atmosfera londinese di questo titolo della WMG si respira già dal primo sguardo che poniamo sui suoi simboli. Lo sfondo, una volta composto da colline e prati verdi, lascia il posto alle strutture tipiche della capitale inglese e al Big Ben.\nI simboli stessi che compongono la griglia di gioco richiamano al mondo vittoriano, con calesse, giornali in inglese, topi armati di mascherina sugli occhi (come ogni rapinatore che si rispetti) e il lupo ottiene così un cilindro e un monocolo.\nIl tutto è accompagnato da una musica di atmosfera e dai suoni che puntano a farci immedesimare con l’ambientazione (il vociare della gente, il suono degli zoccoli dei cavalli). È ovvio che la WMG abbia voluto investire molto dal lato visivo e sonoro, anche se questo potrebbe disturbare quei giocatori che si erano avvicinati alla vecchia Play Gold grazie alla sua semplicità e intuitività.\n\nFowl Play London: meccaniche di gioco\nPassiamo quindi all’aspetto tecnico vero e proprio. Stiamo parlando di un gioco che sfrutta le stesse meccaniche del suo predecessore, con tanto di similarità nei simboli. Il lupo è ancora una volta il simbolo Wild e questa volta è specificato con una scritta (mentre nel titolo originale era meno chiaro). Anche l’uovo d’oro, ovvero la combinazione da maggior valore, è rimasta tra le vincite sebbene abbia cambiato leggermente l’aspetto arricchendosi di pietre preziose.\nPer quanto riguarda invece il simbolo che ci dà accesso alla modalità bonus, in questo caso la gallina bianca è stata catturata e sarà compito del gallo/Sherlock Holmes di trovarla. Nella minigioco, dovremo ispezionare una camera nel tentativo di trovare gli indizi necessari.\nA differenza della slot originale il minigioco diventa molto più interessante: trovando l’indizio potremo andare avanti di stanza in stanza cercando il maxi-premio finale. Possiamo inoltre trovare delle vincite singole che si andranno a sommare al nostro conto e rischiamo di trovare la zampa del lupo, che farà uscire il criminale dal nascondiglio sparando al povero gallo e ponendo fine alla modalità.\nInsomma, sia da un punto di vista grafico che di gameplay, la slot dimostra di aver abbandonato la propria semplicità in favore di un gameplay più coinvolgente.\n\nSlot simili a Fowl Play London\nData la fama di questo personaggio, non è raro che Sherlock Holmes venga utilizzato come tema per una slot machine. Quindi allontanandoci dalle slot della WMG, andiamo a scoprire altre slot con il medesimo argomento: Sherlock Mystery della Playtech ha un gusto più classico, a questa si aggiunge Sherlock Holmes: The Hunt for Blackwood della IGT e London Inspector della Realtime gaming.

The game uses the same mechanics as its predecessor and has similarity in symbols with the wolf as the Wild symbol. The golden egg remains among the winnings but has slightly changed its appearance by adding precious stones. The player can access the bonus mode by finding the white hen that has been captured. In the mode, the player can move from room to room, looking for the ultimate jackpot and getting single payouts that will be added to their account. Finding the wolf's paw will end the mode. Overall, the game has abandoned its simplicity in favor of more engaging gameplay and is a great addition to the slot games with Sherlock Holmes' theme."

After the national success of this slot, it was not surprising to see similar slots or actual spiritual sequels emerge.\n\nAn example of this is Fowl Play London from the same development company: the hen dresses up as Sherlock Holmes and thus assumes an English taste. In this brief review, we will analyze it in detail, comparing it to the previous title.\n\nFowl Play London: Visual Aspects\n\nThe London atmosphere of this WMG title can be felt from the first glance at its symbols. The background, once composed of hills and green fields, gives way to typical London structures and the Big Ben. The symbols that make up the game grid themselves refer to the Victorian world, with carriages, English newspapers, mice armed with eye masks (like any self-respecting robber), and the wolf gets a top hat and a monocle.\n\nAll of this is accompanied by atmospheric music and sounds that aim to immerse us in the setting (the chatter of people, the sound of horse hooves). It is clear that WMG wanted to invest a lot in visual and sound design, even though this may disturb those players who had approached the old Play Gold thanks to its simplicity and intuitiveness.\n\nFowl Play London: Gameplay\n\nLet's now move on to the actual technical aspects of the game. We are talking about a game that uses the same mechanics as its predecessor, with similarity in symbols. The wolf is once again the Wild symbol and is now specified with a written label (while in the original title it was less clear). The golden egg, the combination with the highest value, remains among the winnings, although it has slightly changed its appearance by enriching itself with precious stones.\n\nAs for the symbol that gives us access to the bonus mode, in this case, the white hen has been captured and it will be the task of the rooster/Sherlock Holmes to find her. In the mini-game, we will have to inspect a room in an attempt to find the necessary clues. Unlike the original slot, the mini-game becomes much more interesting: by finding the clue, we can move forward from room to room, looking for the ultimate jackpot. We can also find single payouts that will be added to our account and we risk finding the wolf's paw, which will shoot the poor rooster and end the mode.\n\nIn short, both from a graphical and gameplay point of view, the slot machine shows that it has abandoned its simplicity in favor of a more engaging gameplay.\n\nSimilar Slots to Fowl Play London\n\nGiven the fame of this character, it is not uncommon for Sherlock Holmes to be used as a theme for slot machines. So, moving away from WMG slots, we discover other slots with the same subject: Sherlock Mystery by Playtech has a more classic flavor, to which Sherlock Holmes: The Hunt for Blackwood by IGT and London Inspector by Realtime gaming are added. But these are just some of the many related ones.\n            ",

Don’t worry, you won’t need a magnifying glass to navigate the reels!</p><p>Now let’s talk about the bonus mode. It’s like a good game of Clue, with the potential for big payouts. But be warned, it’s not for the faint of heart. This mini-game requires a little more brainpower than Fowl Play Gold.

The symbols that make up the gameplay grid refer to the Victorian world, with carriages, English newspapers, mice armed with eye masks, and the wolf dressed up in a top hat and monocle. The atmospheric music and sounds aim to immerse players in the setting of the game.\n\nFowl Play London: Gameplay\n\nFowl Play London uses the same mechanics as its predecessor, Fowl Play Gold, with similarities in symbols. The wolf is once again the Wild symbol, while the golden egg is the combination with the highest value. The white hen symbol gives players access to the bonus mode. In the mini-game, players will inspect a room in an attempt to find the clue necessary to move forward from room to room, looking for the ultimate jackpot. The mini-game becomes much more interesting than the original title. However, the gameplay is more complex and may be difficult for some players who preferred the simplicity and intuitiveness of the old Fowl Play Gold.\n\nFowl Play London: Bonus Mode\n\nThe bonus mode in Fowl Play London is activated by finding the white hen symbol. In the mini-game, players will search for a clue that will help them find the ultimate jackpot. There are several rooms to search and finding the correct clue will allow the player to advance to the next room. Single payouts can also be found that are added to the player's account. Players must be careful, however, as finding the wolf's paw will end the mode.\n\nFowl Play London: London Theme\n\nFowl Play London has a London theme that can be felt throughout the game. The setting has changed from green fields to typical London structures and the Big Ben. The symbols and sounds that make up the game refer to the Victorian era. The wolf dressed up in a top hat and monocle adds a touch of humor to the game.\n\nFowl Play London vs. Fowl Play Gold\n\nFowl Play London is a more complex game than its predecessor, Fowl Play Gold. The graphics and sound design have been significantly improved, but some players may find the game more confusing. The bonus mode is much more interesting, and the mini-game is engaging, but it requires more effort to play. Players who preferred the simplicity and intuitiveness of Fowl Play Gold may find Fowl Play London less appealing. However, fans of the Sherlock Holmes theme and those looking for a more complex and engaging game experience may prefer Fowl Play London.\n\n        \n            ",

The game is set in London and features Sherlock Holmes, who replaces the previous game's hen as the protagonist.\n\nGame mechanics and symbols\n\nFowl Play London uses the same mechanics as its predecessor, with similarity in symbols. Wolf again acts as the Wild symbol and gains a written label in this game. The highest value combination is the golden egg, which has changed slightly in appearance and now has precious stones. Other symbols include carriages, English newspapers, mice armed with eye masks, and a wolf in top hat and monocle.\n\nBonus mode and gameplay\n\nIn Fowl Play London, players can access a bonus mode by finding the white hen. The rooster/Sherlock Holmes will need to search a room for clues in this mini-game to move forward from room to room. Single payouts will be added to the player's account when a clue is found, and they run the risk of finding the wolf's paw that will end the bonus mode.\n\nAtmospheric elements of the game\n\nFowl Play London's symbols and background reflect the Victorian culture. It also features the typical London structures, such as Big Ben, and immersive designs that aim to put players in the heart of the city. The sound effects are also atmospheric, such as the chatter of people and the sound of horse hooves. WMG has designed this game graphically and sound-wise to add more excitement to gameplay.\n\nComparison to its predecessor\n\nFowl Play London is similar to its predecessor, Fowl Play Gold, in terms of its mechanics while being more engaging in terms of gameplay. Compared to Fowl Play Gold, Fowl Play London has a more complex design, and the bonus mode has been improved to be more engaging and highly functional, making it more likely to retain player interest. With Sherlock Holmes's popularity, it is not surprising that WMG has taken full advantage of the character in Fowl Play London.\n\n        \n            ",

After the national success of this slot, it was not surprising to see similar slots or actual spiritual sequels emerge.\n\nAn example of this is Fowl Play London from the same development company: the hen dresses up as Sherlock Holmes and thus assumes an English taste. In this brief review, we will analyze it in detail, comparing it to the previous title.\n\nFowl Play London: Visual Aspects\n\nThe London atmosphere of this WMG title can be felt from the first glance at its symbols. The background, once composed of hills and green fields, gives way to typical London structures and the Big Ben. The symbols that make up the game grid themselves refer to the Victorian world, with carriages, English newspapers, mice armed with eye masks (like any self-respecting robber), and the wolf gets a top hat and a monocle.\n\nAll of this is accompanied by atmospheric music and sounds that aim to immerse us in the setting (the chatter of people, the sound of horse hooves). It is clear that WMG wanted to invest a lot in visual and sound design, even though this may disturb those players who had approached the old Play Gold thanks to its simplicity and intuitiveness.\n\nFowl Play London: Gameplay\n\nLet's now move on to the actual technical aspects of the game. We are talking about a game that uses the same mechanics as its predecessor, with similarity in symbols. The wolf is once again the Wild symbol and is now specified with a written label (while in the original title it was less clear). The golden egg, the combination with the highest value, remains among the winnings, although it has slightly changed its appearance by enriching itself with precious stones.\n\nAs for the symbol that gives us access to the bonus mode, in this case, the white hen has been captured and it will be the task of the rooster/Sherlock Holmes to find her. In the mini-game, we will have to inspect a room in an attempt to find the necessary clues. Unlike the original slot, the mini-game becomes much more interesting: by finding the clue, we can move forward from room to room, looking for the ultimate jackpot. We can also find single payouts that will be added to our account and we risk finding the wolf's paw, which will shoot the poor rooster and end the mode.\n\nIn short, both from a graphical and gameplay point of view, the slot machine shows that it has abandoned its simplicity in favor of a more engaging gameplay.\n\nSimilar Slots to Fowl Play London\n\nGiven the fame of this character, it is not uncommon for Sherlock Holmes to be used as a theme for slot machines. So, moving away from WMG slots, we discover other slots with the same subject: Sherlock Mystery by Playtech has a more classic flavor, to which Sherlock Holmes: The Hunt for Blackwood by IGT and London Inspector by Realtime gaming are added. But these are just some of the many related ones.\n            ",

After the national success of this slot, it was not surprising to see similar slots or actual spiritual sequels emerge.\n\nAn example of this is Fowl Play London from the same development company: the hen dresses up as Sherlock Holmes and thus assumes an English taste. In this brief review, we will analyze it in detail, comparing it to the previous title.\n\nFowl Play London: Visual Aspects\n\nThe London atmosphere of this WMG title can be felt from the first glance at its symbols. The background, once composed of hills and green fields, gives way to typical London structures and the Big Ben. The symbols that make up the game grid themselves refer to the Victorian world, with carriages, English newspapers, mice armed with eye masks (like any self-respecting robber), and the wolf gets a top hat and a monocle.\n\nAll of this is accompanied by atmospheric music and sounds that aim to immerse us in the setting (the chatter of people, the sound of horse hooves). It is clear that WMG wanted to invest a lot in visual and sound design, even though this may disturb those players who had approached the old Play Gold thanks to its simplicity and intuitiveness.\n\nFowl Play London: Gameplay\n\nLet's now move on to the actual technical aspects of the game. We are talking about a game that uses the same mechanics as its predecessor, with similarity in symbols. The wolf is once again the Wild symbol and is now specified with a written label (while in the original title it was less clear). The golden egg, the combination with the highest value, remains among the winnings, although it has slightly changed its appearance by enriching itself with precious stones.\n\nAs for the symbol that gives us access to the bonus mode, in this case, the white hen has been captured and it will be the task of the rooster/Sherlock Holmes to find her. In the mini-game, we will have to inspect a room in an attempt to find the necessary clues. Unlike the original slot, the mini-game becomes much more interesting: by finding the clue, we can move forward from room to room, looking for the ultimate jackpot. We can also find single payouts that will be added to our account and we risk finding the wolf's paw, which will shoot the poor rooster and end the mode.\n\nIn short, both from a graphical and gameplay point of view, the slot machine shows that it has abandoned its simplicity in favor of a more engaging gameplay.\n\nSimilar Slots to Fowl Play London\n\nGiven the fame of this character, it is not uncommon for Sherlock Holmes to be used as a theme for slot machines. So, moving away from WMG slots, we discover other slots with the same subject: Sherlock Mystery by Playtech has a more classic flavor, to which Sherlock Holmes: The Hunt for Blackwood by IGT and London Inspector by Realtime gaming are added. But these are just some of the many related ones.\n            ",
