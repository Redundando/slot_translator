Il buon aspetto non è affatto la parte principale di qualsiasi gioco, ma si possono davvero vedere i livelli di dettaglio che sono entrati nel design del gioco e nel tema e quindi non c’è da stupirsi che Spielo continui a spingere pesantemente lo slot. Un posto che non hanno ancora spinto il gioco è nella loro selezione di giochi online.\nUna grafica leggendaria\nCome si può immaginare, queste spettacolari grafiche sono tutte basate sul tema Maya, il che significa un sacco di statue, piante e simboli a tema in gioco. Non c’è nemmeno spazio per le icone delle carte da gioco, il che contribuisce ad aumentare l’atmosfera generale. Indubbiamente il simbolo clou del gioco di base è il ‘Quetzalcoatl’, che è una creatura simile a un drago e un jolly che può espandersi fino a coprire interi rulli contemporaneamente. Può comparire su qualsiasi bobina e su tutte le bobine, il che consente di ottenere alcune combinazioni massicce lungo il percorso, dato che questa slot può essere pagata su un massimo di cinquanta linee di vincita.\nL’altro punto culminante del gioco è rappresentato dai giri gratuiti, ai quali si accede nel modo tradizionale di ottenere tre o più monete d’oro sparse sui rulli. Quando lo fai con successo, ti vengono presentate tre diverse opzioni per i tuoi giri. La prima è la più grande quantità di giri, quindici, che giocano con la terza bobina completamente selvaggia in ogni momento. In alternativa, si può optare per dieci giochi gratuiti con entrambe le bobine due e quattro wild. Infine, potete scegliere cinque giochi gratis con i rulli uno, tre e cinque wild. Ovviamente quest’ultimo significa che ogni singolo giro darà un premio, ma la pratica vi rivelerà quale delle scelte è quella giusta per voi.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nMayan Magic continua ad essere una star assoluta della scena terrestre e non abbiamo dubbi che alla fine sarà disponibile una versione online. Nel frattempo, la vostra migliore scommessa è la nostra alternativa online, che abbiamo messo insieme con il tema e i giri gratuiti in mente. Nella pagina dedicata alle alternative online di Mayan Magic, troverete non solo i giochi stessi, ma anche i posti migliori per giocare online con soldi veri, bonus più grandi e rendimenti più alti!\nLa Mayan Magic Video Slot di Spielo presenta una serie di simboli unici su bobina. Ci sono 10 simboli standard che possono formare combinazioni vincenti sulle bobine. I simboli di base consistono in una selezione di frutta e piante. Questi simboli richiedono ai giocatori di atterrare almeno tre simboli corrispondenti su una linea di pagamento attiva. I simboli pagheranno tra 5x e 200x la Sua scommessa, con il simbolo della pesca che è il simbolo di base di valore più alto.\nI simboli a cui si vuole prestare attenzione sono i simboli della Farfalla, gli emblemi Maya verde e viola e la maschera Maya dorata. Questi simboli richiedono due o più simboli corrispondenti su una linea di pagamento attiva per attivare un pagamento. Questi simboli possono pagare da 2 a 500 volte l’importo della vostra scommessa, a seconda del numero di simboli corrispondenti che mettete in fila.\nIl logo Maya Magic è il simbolo di valore più alto e condivide gli stessi pagamenti del simbolo jolly di Quetzalcoatl. I giocatori possono aspettarsi fino a 1000 volte la loro scommessa quando allineano il logo su una linea di pagamento attiva.\nPrima di iniziare a far girare i manufatti Maya sui rulli, spostatevi sulla tabella dei pagamenti per scoprire i premi che potreste vincere.\nIl gioco si gioca con un totale di 10 simboli standard che si combinano per creare combinazioni vincenti sui rulli.\nI frutti e le piante sono i simboli di valore più basso e richiedono una partita di almeno tre per pagare una vincita. La pesca è il simbolo più alto in questa categoria e paga fino a x200 per abbinare tutti e cinque.\nGli altri simboli nella tabella dei pagamenti richiedono solo una partita di due per scatenare una vittoria. Il Quetzalcoatl e il segno Magia Maya sono i due premi più alti che offrono fino a x1.000 se filate su una linea di pagamento attiva.\nIl resto dei simboli, come la farfalla, la maschera e i disegni maya, rientrano nella categoria intermedia, richiedendo solo una partita a due e pagando fino a x500 per cinque dello stesso.\nAltre Slot Machine\nMaya Gold è un’altra Slot Machine prodotta da Spielo, che possiamo consigliarti se hai amato Mayan Magic.
