Among the regular symbols are the royals, which are the numbers and letters corresponding to playing cards, in this case from 9 to Ace. Accompanying the royals are cacti, gold nuggets, an eagle, and a rock. The most rewarding symbol is the dollar sign, which pays out 40 times the bet when it appears on all five reels.\n\nThe wild symbol is a flaming horse, which can appear only in the base game and only on reels 3, 4, and 5.

The dollar symbol is the most lucrative, paying 40 times the bet if it appears on all five reels.\nThe Wild symbol is instead a blazing horse, which can only appear in the base game and only on reels 3, 4 and 5. There is also a Scatter that allows you to get a variable number of free spins.\nGameplay and special features\nAs already mentioned, from Mustang Money Raging Rooster you should not expect fireworks, but you can count on an intuitive and at the same time engaging gameplay, with excellent chances of obtaining rich prizes.\nTo have regular winnings, it is sufficient to align identical symbols on adjacent reels starting from the left to the right, but in this case, the winnings will not be much. The big prizes come when using the two special features:\n\nThe first is activated thanks to the Wild coin, a symbol that only appears on reels two and 4 and only during free spins, which gives multipliers up to 5x.\nThe second is called Raging Rooster and is activated when the homonymous symbol appears on reel 5, starting the rooster fight: you choose a bird and fight in a ring. Based on the number of wins in the ring, you can get one of the 4 jackpots available, with a cash value ranging from a minimum of €60 up to the maximum victory of €30,000 with the Grand Bonus.\n        ",
