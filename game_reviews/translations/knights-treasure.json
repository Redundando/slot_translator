L’ambientazione di questa slot ci porterà a giocare in una realtà fantastica, dove regnano la magia e gli scontri con la spada. In questo mondo, potenti cavalieri sono chiamati a duellare contro feroci orchi per la supremazia ed il potere; tu dovrai cercare di accumulare il maggior numero di ricchezze giocando al meglio i tuoi spin. Grazie al bonus stage offerto da questa slot machine, avrai la possibilità di far crescere il tuo tesoro; sconfiggi il terribile Orco duellando contro di lui e porta a casa ottime vincite!\nGrafica della slot machine\nCome per gli altri prodotti di casa WMG, la grafica con cui è realizzata la slot è molto curata, fluida nelle animazioni e ricca di dettagli. Tutti i personaggi presenti hanno una propria animazione personalizzata che diventa visibile dopo uno spin vincente. I simboli della slot machine fanno tutti riferimento al mondo fantasy e, oltre a 3 diverse tipologie di orchi, sono presenti immagini che si riferiscono a questa ambientazione: un Cavaliere, uno Scudo, un Libro degli incantesimi, un’Ascia da guerra, uno Stendardo ed una Maga. Attraverso il pulsante “Autoplay” è possibile impostare fino a 500 giri automatici.\nLe funzioni e i bonus della slot\nKnights Treasure è una classica slot a 5 rulli nella quale puoi scegliere di giocare con un minimo di 5 linee di pagamento oppure aumentare la posta e arrivare fino a 10 linee totali. Attraverso il pulsante “Bet” puoi selezionare il numero di linee da rendere attive durante la partita e, contemporaneamente, aumentare il valore della puntata in corso. Non sono presenti free spin, ma la particolarità di questa slot machine risiede nella sua modalità “doppio spin”; dopo un primo giro di rulli infatti, hai la possibilità di bloccarne alcuni a tuo piacere, per poter tentare di creare una nuova combinazione vincente attraverso un secondo giro. Questa seconda chance di gioco rende questa slot molto attraente, aumenta il divertimento e la voglia di giocare. Il Wild della slot machine è rappresentato dal simbolo che raffigura una Maga. Quando compare su uno o più rulli ti aiuta a completare al meglio le combinazioni vincenti. Il simbolo che raffigura tesori e ricchezze con la scritta “Bonus” è il secondo simbolo speciale della slot machine. Se ne compaiono 3, 4 o 5 sui rulli, viene attivato il bonus game. Sarai chiamato a duellare a turni con un Orco; dovrai cercare di sconfiggerlo colpendolo con la spada prima che lui finisca la tua energia con i suoi colpi. Ogni colpo andato a segno ti garantirà una buona vincita; per ottenere il bonus più elevato dovrai sconfiggere del tutto l’Orco. Sono disponibili tre tipi di vincite bonus: il più alto è rappresentato dalla scritta “Big Win” dorata, il secondo da un Calice in oro, mentre il terzo in ordine di grandezza, da un Candelabro argentato.\nSlot simili a Knights Treasure\nEscludendo altri titoli targati WMG, non si trovano in commercio molte slot machine che offrono la stessa tipologia di gioco a “doppio spin” come in Knights Treasure. Yabba Dabba Dosh e la Slot Machine Witch Hunter permettono di bloccare alcuni dei rulli a piacere del giocatore prima di effettuare un secondo spin con la possibilità di creare una nuova combinazione vincente, proprio come succede in Knights Treasure. A parte la modalità “doppio spin” in comune, queste due slot machine presentano un’ambientazione e tematiche differenti.\n",

The setting of this slot will take us to play in a fantastic reality, where magic and sword fights reign. In this world, powerful knights are called to duel against fierce orcs for supremacy and power; you have to try to accumulate the greatest amount of wealth by playing your spins the best. Thanks to the bonus stage offered by this slot machine, you will have the opportunity to grow your treasure; defeat the terrible Orc by dueling against him and bring home excellent winnings!\n\nSlot Machine Graphics\nAs with other WMG products, the graphics used for the slot are meticulously crafted, with fluid animations and rich details. All the present characters have their own custom animation that becomes visible after a winning spin. The slot machine symbols all refer to the fantasy world, and in addition to three different types of orcs, there are images that refer to this setting: a Knight, a Shield, a Book of Spells, a War Axe, a Banner, and a Mage. Through the \"Autoplay\" button, you can set up to 500 automatic spins.\n\nSlot Functions and Bonuses\nKnight's Treasure is a classic 5-reel slot in which you can choose to play with a minimum of 5 pay lines or increase the stake and go up to 10 total lines. Using the \"Bet\" button, you can select the number of lines to activate during the game and simultaneously increase the value of the current bet.

After the first round of reels, you have the possibility to block some of them at your pleasure to try to create a new winning combination through a second spin. This second chance to play makes this slot very attractive, increasing the fun and desire to play. The Wild of the slot machine is represented by the symbol depicting a Mage. When it appears on one or more reels, it helps you complete the best winning combinations. The symbol representing treasures and riches with the word \"Bonus\" is the second special symbol of the slot machine. If 3, 4, or 5 appear on the reels, the bonus game is activated. You will be called to duel in turns with an Orc. You have to try to defeat him by hitting him with the sword before he finishes your energy with his blows.

Three types of bonus winnings are available: the highest is represented by the golden \"Big Win\" writing, the second by a golden chalice, while the third in order of size is a silver candelabrum.\n\nSlots Similar to Knight's Treasure\nApart from other WMG titles, there are not many slot machines on the market that offer the same \"Double Spin\" type of game as in Knight's Treasure. Yabba Dabba Dosh and the Witch Hunter Slot Machine allow you to block some of the reels at the player's pleasure before making a second spin with the possibility of creating a new winning combination, just like in Knight's Treasure. Apart from the common \"Double Spin\" mode, these two slot machines have different settings and themes.\n            ",

Each hit guarantees you a good win; to get the highest bonus, you have to completely defeat the Orc. Three types of bonus winnings are available: the highest is represented by the golden \"Big Win\" writing, the second by a golden chalice, while the third in order of size is a silver candelabrum.\n\nSlots Similar to Knight's Treasure\nApart from other WMG titles, there are not many slot machines on the market that offer the same \"Double Spin\" type of game as in Knight's Treasure. Yabba Dabba Dosh and the Witch Hunter Slot Machine allow you to block some of the reels at the player's pleasure before making a second spin with the possibility of creating a new winning combination, just like in Knight's Treasure. Apart from the common \"Double Spin\" mode, these two slot machines have different settings and themes.\n            ",

The setting of this slot will take us to play in a fantastic reality, where magic and sword fights reign. In this world, powerful knights are called to duel against fierce orcs for supremacy and power; you have to try to accumulate the greatest amount of wealth by playing your spins the best. Thanks to the bonus stage offered by this slot machine, you will have the opportunity to grow your treasure; defeat the terrible Orc by dueling against him and bring home excellent winnings!\n\nSlot Machine Graphics\nAs with other WMG products, the graphics used for the slot are meticulously crafted, with fluid animations and rich details. All the present characters have their own custom animation that becomes visible after a winning spin. The slot machine symbols all refer to the fantasy world, and in addition to three different types of orcs, there are images that refer to this setting: a Knight, a Shield, a Book of Spells, a War Axe, a Banner, and a Mage. Through the \"Autoplay\" button, you can set up to 500 automatic spins.\n\nSlot Functions and Bonuses\nKnight's Treasure is a classic 5-reel slot in which you can choose to play with a minimum of 5 pay lines or increase the stake and go up to 10 total lines. Using the \"Bet\" button, you can select the number of lines to activate during the game and simultaneously increase the value of the current bet. There are no free spins, but the peculiarity of this slot machine lies in its \"Double Spin\" mode. After the first round of reels, you have the possibility to block some of them at your pleasure to try to create a new winning combination through a second spin. This second chance to play makes this slot very attractive, increasing the fun and desire to play. The Wild of the slot machine is represented by the symbol depicting a Mage. When it appears on one or more reels, it helps you complete the best winning combinations. The symbol representing treasures and riches with the word \"Bonus\" is the second special symbol of the slot machine. If 3, 4, or 5 appear on the reels, the bonus game is activated. You will be called to duel in turns with an Orc. You have to try to defeat him by hitting him with the sword before he finishes your energy with his blows. Each hit guarantees you a good win; to get the highest bonus, you have to completely defeat the Orc. Three types of bonus winnings are available: the highest is represented by the golden \"Big Win\" writing, the second by a golden chalice, while the third in order of size is a silver candelabrum.\n\nSlots Similar to Knight's Treasure\nApart from other WMG titles, there are not many slot machines on the market that offer the same \"Double Spin\" type of game as in Knight's Treasure. Yabba Dabba Dosh and the Witch Hunter Slot Machine allow you to block some of the reels at the player's pleasure before making a second spin with the possibility of creating a new winning combination, just like in Knight's Treasure. Apart from the common \"Double Spin\" mode, these two slot machines have different settings and themes.\n            ",
