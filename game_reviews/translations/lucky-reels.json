The Lucky Reels slot is a game on its own, with six reels and three rows playing on 20 constantly active paylines. Wazdan's slot experts had a great idea to give an innovative touch to a recurring theme. They had the reel-set enclosed in a modernist frame and the center of it appears to be convex, giving the entire setup a sleek but impressive look. Those who notice it will appreciate it as part of the graphical aspect of Lucky Reels. The rest is pure online slot adventure with gameplay that includes bonus features.\n\nFruit symbols are repeated in hundreds of slots, but not all are equipped with free spins and multipliers. This is the game that does it, so it has some highlights that are in line with the potential for a larger win than usual.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe paytable is the only place where players can get information about the pay symbol without even playing. The table can be accessed from the question mark icon in the lower left corner of the page, which will pull up the window where you can scroll down to view useful information on multipliers and how to activate the spins without slot Lucky Reels.\n\nThe most valuable symbol in the game is the Wild. Not only does it replace any other symbol (except for scatter/bonus), the symbol pays 500x on the bet line when they fall on a line. Five on a line and the prize is half of that - still a heavy win. The scatter symbol, represented by a diamond, pays 200x for six matching symbols. The red seven is 250x on the line for six and 100x for five.\n\nLucky Reels also offers the Gamble option. This can be activated following any base game win, and allows players to play a guessing game where a correct guess will double the win, and this could go on for a certain number of consecutive times and lead to potentially sizable sums.\n\nIt's pretty cool how it's done. The player can choose between two slot machines. Each of them has one of the fruit symbols or a grin. Guess who does what.\n\nThis slot game has the good old free spins bonus in the form. Land three or more diamonds and win free spins in the following order: three diamonds equals 15 spins, four equals 20, five equals 25, and six equals 30 - plus the cash prize which is a multiplier on the payline bet.\n\nIn addition, the game offers four special symbols with an attached multiplier on them. The smallest multiplier is x1 and the largest is x8 on the total result of the win.\n\nOther Slot Machine\n\nThe name of the Slot Machine we're about to tell you about is very similar to that of the review, but it definitely isn't the same.

The Lucky Reels slot is a game on its own, with six reels and three rows playing on 20 constantly active paylines. Wazdan's slot experts had a great idea to give an innovative touch to a recurring theme. They had the reel-set enclosed in a modernist frame and the center of it appears to be convex, giving the entire setup a sleek but impressive look. Those who notice it will appreciate it as part of the graphical aspect of Lucky Reels. The rest is pure online slot adventure with gameplay that includes bonus features.\n\nFruit symbols are repeated in hundreds of slots, but not all are equipped with free spins and multipliers. This is the game that does it, so it has some highlights that are in line with the potential for a larger win than usual.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe paytable is the only place where players can get information about the pay symbol without even playing. The table can be accessed from the question mark icon in the lower left corner of the page, which will pull up the window where you can scroll down to view useful information on multipliers and how to activate the spins without slot Lucky Reels.\n\nThe most valuable symbol in the game is the Wild. Not only does it replace any other symbol (except for scatter/bonus), the symbol pays 500x on the bet line when they fall on a line. Five on a line and the prize is half of that - still a heavy win. The scatter symbol, represented by a diamond, pays 200x for six matching symbols. The red seven is 250x on the line for six and 100x for five.\n\nLucky Reels also offers the Gamble option. This can be activated following any base game win, and allows players to play a guessing game where a correct guess will double the win, and this could go on for a certain number of consecutive times and lead to potentially sizable sums.\n\nIt's pretty cool how it's done. The player can choose between two slot machines. Each of them has one of the fruit symbols or a grin. Guess who does what.\n\nThis slot game has the good old free spins bonus in the form. Land three or more diamonds and win free spins in the following order: three diamonds equals 15 spins, four equals 20, five equals 25, and six equals 30 - plus the cash prize which is a multiplier on the payline bet.\n\nIn addition, the game offers four special symbols with an attached multiplier on them. The smallest multiplier is x1 and the largest is x8 on the total result of the win.\n\nOther Slot Machine\n\nThe name of the Slot Machine we're about to tell you about is very similar to that of the review, but it definitely isn't the same. If you enjoyed Wazdan's, you can bet your money on Super Lucky Reels, the Slot Machine that allows you to win 10x multipliers and the Super Jackpot. As an experienced gambler, you don't want to miss out on these exciting opportunities for big wins.\n        ",

This is the game that does it, so it has some highlights that are in line with the potential for a larger win than usual.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe paytable is the only place where players can get information about the pay symbol without even playing. The table can be accessed from the question mark icon in the lower left corner of the page, which will pull up the window where you can scroll down to view useful information on multipliers and how to activate the spins without slot Lucky Reels.\n\nThe most valuable symbol in the game is the Wild. Not only does it replace any other symbol (except for scatter/bonus), the symbol pays 500x on the bet line when they fall on a line. Five on a line and the prize is half of that - still a heavy win. The scatter symbol, represented by a diamond, pays 200x for six matching symbols. The red seven is 250x on the line for six and 100x for five.\n\nLucky Reels also offers the Gamble option. This can be activated following any base game win, and allows players to play a guessing game where a correct guess will double the win, and this could go on for a certain number of consecutive times and lead to potentially sizable sums.\n\nIt's pretty cool how it's done. The player can choose between two slot machines. Each of them has one of the fruit symbols or a grin. Guess who does what.\n\nThis slot game has the good old free spins bonus in the form. Land three or more diamonds and win free spins in the following order: three diamonds equals 15 spins, four equals 20, five equals 25, and six equals 30 - plus the cash prize which is a multiplier on the payline bet.\n\nIn addition, the game offers four special symbols with an attached multiplier on them. The smallest multiplier is x1 and the largest is x8 on the total result of the win.\n\nOther Slot Machine\n\nThe name of the Slot Machine we're about to tell you about is very similar to that of the review, but it definitely isn't the same. If you enjoyed Wazdan's, you can bet your money on Super Lucky Reels, the Slot Machine that allows you to win 10x multipliers and the Super Jackpot. As an experienced gambler, you don't want to miss out on these exciting opportunities for big wins.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Features\n\nLucky Reels is a fruit-themed game that offers six reels and three rows with gameplay that includes bonus features like free spins and multipliers up to x8. The game also includes a Gamble option where a correct guess will double the win.\n\nPaytable Information\n\nThe paytable can be accessed from the question mark icon in the lower left corner of the page. The most valuable symbol is the Wild which replaces any other symbol and pays 500x on the bet line when they fall on a line. The scatter symbol pays 200x for six matching symbols and the red seven is 250x on the line for six and 100x for five.\n\nGraphics and Theme\n\nLucky Reels is a fruit-themed slot that is not the typical Las Vegas retro slot. The game has a sleek look with a modernist frame enclosing the reel-set with fruit symbols. The center of the reel-set is convex, adding an innovative touch to a recurring theme.\n\nBonus Features\n\nLucky Reels offers the free spins bonus feature which can be triggered by landing three or more diamond symbols. The bonus feature gives players 15 to 30 free spins, depending on the number of diamonds landed, plus a multiplier on the payline bet. The game also offers four special symbols with an attached multiplier on them, ranging from x1 to x8 on the total result of the win.\n\nOther Games by Wazdan\n\nIf you enjoyed Lucky Reels, you may want to try Super Lucky Reels by Wazdan. It features 10x multipliers and the Super Jackpot, which offers exciting opportunities for big wins.\n\n        \n            ",

The slot experts at Wazdan LTD have designed the reel-set enclosed in a modernist frame with the center of it appearing to be convex, giving the entire setup a sleek and impressive look.\n\nUseful Information on Multipliers and Paytable\n\nPlayers can access the paytable from the question mark icon in the lower left corner of the page to view useful information on multipliers and how to activate the spins without playing. There are also four special symbols in the game with an attached multiplier ranging from x1 to x8.\n\nWild Symbol as the Most Valuable\n\nThe most valuable symbol in the game is the Wild symbol, which not only replaces any other symbol except for scatter/bonus, but also pays 500x on the bet line when they fall on a line. Meanwhile, five on a line gives a prize that is half of that. The scatter symbol represented by a diamond pays 200x for six matching symbols, while the red seven pays 250x on the line for six and 100x for five. Players can also choose the Gamble option to potentially double their wins.\n\n        \n            ",

The game has a bonus feature that could earn up to 30 free spins and multipliers ranging from x1 to x8 for a top push on winnings. Play with a theoretical player return of 96.60%.\n\nTraditional graphics\n\nStep onto the Lucky Reels slot and try your luck for a chance to win 2500x on the line bet. Trigger free spins bonuses and multipliers up to x8.\n\nPlay a fruit-themed slot that reflects none of the classic fruits found in old Vegas and retro online slots. The Lucky Reels slot is a game on its own, with six reels and three rows playing on 20 constantly active paylines. Wazdan's slot experts had a great idea to give an innovative touch to a recurring theme. They had the reel-set enclosed in a modernist frame and the center of it appears to be convex, giving the entire setup a sleek but impressive look. Those who notice it will appreciate it as part of the graphical aspect of Lucky Reels. The rest is pure online slot adventure with gameplay that includes bonus features.\n\nFruit symbols are repeated in hundreds of slots, but not all are equipped with free spins and multipliers. This is the game that does it, so it has some highlights that are in line with the potential for a larger win than usual.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe paytable is the only place where players can get information about the pay symbol without even playing. The table can be accessed from the question mark icon in the lower left corner of the page, which will pull up the window where you can scroll down to view useful information on multipliers and how to activate the spins without slot Lucky Reels.\n\nThe most valuable symbol in the game is the Wild. Not only does it replace any other symbol (except for scatter/bonus), the symbol pays 500x on the bet line when they fall on a line. Five on a line and the prize is half of that - still a heavy win. The scatter symbol, represented by a diamond, pays 200x for six matching symbols. The red seven is 250x on the line for six and 100x for five.\n\nLucky Reels also offers the Gamble option. This can be activated following any base game win, and allows players to play a guessing game where a correct guess will double the win, and this could go on for a certain number of consecutive times and lead to potentially sizable sums.\n\nIt's pretty cool how it's done. The player can choose between two slot machines. Each of them has one of the fruit symbols or a grin. Guess who does what.\n\nThis slot game has the good old free spins bonus in the form. Land three or more diamonds and win free spins in the following order: three diamonds equals 15 spins, four equals 20, five equals 25, and six equals 30 - plus the cash prize which is a multiplier on the payline bet.\n\nIn addition, the game offers four special symbols with an attached multiplier on them. The smallest multiplier is x1 and the largest is x8 on the total result of the win.\n\nOther Slot Machine\n\nThe name of the Slot Machine we're about to tell you about is very similar to that of the review, but it definitely isn't the same. If you enjoyed Wazdan's, you can bet your money on Super Lucky Reels, the Slot Machine that allows you to win 10x multipliers and the Super Jackpot. As an experienced gambler, you don't want to miss out on these exciting opportunities for big wins.\n            ",

The game has a bonus feature that could earn up to 30 free spins and multipliers ranging from x1 to x8 for a top push on winnings. Play with a theoretical player return of 96.60%.\n\nTraditional graphics\n\nStep onto the Lucky Reels slot and try your luck for a chance to win 2500x on the line bet. Trigger free spins bonuses and multipliers up to x8.\n\nPlay a fruit-themed slot that reflects none of the classic fruits found in old Vegas and retro online slots. The Lucky Reels slot is a game on its own, with six reels and three rows playing on 20 constantly active paylines. Wazdan's slot experts had a great idea to give an innovative touch to a recurring theme. They had the reel-set enclosed in a modernist frame and the center of it appears to be convex, giving the entire setup a sleek but impressive look. Those who notice it will appreciate it as part of the graphical aspect of Lucky Reels. The rest is pure online slot adventure with gameplay that includes bonus features.\n\nFruit symbols are repeated in hundreds of slots, but not all are equipped with free spins and multipliers. This is the game that does it, so it has some highlights that are in line with the potential for a larger win than usual.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe paytable is the only place where players can get information about the pay symbol without even playing. The table can be accessed from the question mark icon in the lower left corner of the page, which will pull up the window where you can scroll down to view useful information on multipliers and how to activate the spins without slot Lucky Reels.\n\nThe most valuable symbol in the game is the Wild. Not only does it replace any other symbol (except for scatter/bonus), the symbol pays 500x on the bet line when they fall on a line. Five on a line and the prize is half of that - still a heavy win. The scatter symbol, represented by a diamond, pays 200x for six matching symbols. The red seven is 250x on the line for six and 100x for five.\n\nLucky Reels also offers the Gamble option. This can be activated following any base game win, and allows players to play a guessing game where a correct guess will double the win, and this could go on for a certain number of consecutive times and lead to potentially sizable sums.\n\nIt's pretty cool how it's done. The player can choose between two slot machines. Each of them has one of the fruit symbols or a grin. Guess who does what.\n\nThis slot game has the good old free spins bonus in the form. Land three or more diamonds and win free spins in the following order: three diamonds equals 15 spins, four equals 20, five equals 25, and six equals 30 - plus the cash prize which is a multiplier on the payline bet.\n\nIn addition, the game offers four special symbols with an attached multiplier on them. The smallest multiplier is x1 and the largest is x8 on the total result of the win.\n\nOther Slot Machine\n\nThe name of the Slot Machine we're about to tell you about is very similar to that of the review, but it definitely isn't the same. If you enjoyed Wazdan's, you can bet your money on Super Lucky Reels, the Slot Machine that allows you to win 10x multipliers and the Super Jackpot. As an experienced gambler, you don't want to miss out on these exciting opportunities for big wins.\n        ",
