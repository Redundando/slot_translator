La Ainsworth ha deciso di celebrare questa passione con una slot adrenalina ma senza tanti fronzoli, con una gameplay di vecchia scuola e una grafica importante. Il gioco si ispira alle corse automobilistiche in stile Fast and Furious, con macchine tirate a lucido e motori graffianti. I rulli si trova all’interno dell’auto e tutte le impostazioni sono sistemate sul quadrante digitale, stupendo dal punto di vista grafico. Il comparto sonoro è ridotto al minimo, nessuna musica di sottofondo ma solo il suono dei rulli interrotto dalle accelerate e dalle frenate in curva.\nCaratteristiche di Flash Cash\nLa Ainsworth per questa slot ha voluto imprimere un taglio tradizionale, senza aggiungere livelli o funzioni speciali, ma solo simboli regolari, oltre a Wild, Scatter e ad alcuni moltiplicatori per incrementare le vincite. Proprio per questo, la griglia è una classica 5×3, con massimo 30 linee di pagamento variabili, cioè potremo decidere noi quante attivarne. Naturalmente va da sé che un numero più alto di linee attive si traduce in maggiori probabilità di combinazioni vincenti. Tra l’altro le scommesse sono abbastanza contenute, visto che per ogni linea attiva si paga appena 0,01 €, anche se poi si può salire di livello raggiungendo i 100 € sempre per linea. Per chi volesse, è possibile attivare i giri automatici cliccando sul tasto + posto accanto allo start. In questo caso si aprirà una finestra con un cursore a scorrimento. Il numero massimo di giri automatici attivabili è 100 senza limiti di vincita o di perdita. La volatilità è media, si vince poco e spesso, mentre abbiamo trovato un RTP leggermente più basso della media, pari a 93,93%. È utile ricordare che comunque questo valore incide in minima parte sulle probabilità di vincita e solo a fronte di numerose giocate.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nIn Flash Cash troviamo simboli tematici e non tematici. Questi ultimi , rappresentati dalle carte da gioco dal 10 all’asso, sono anche quelli che pagano meno di tutti. A seguire troviamo il casco, alla ruota, il contachilometri, la bandiera a scacchi con la bottiglia di champagne e la macchina da corsa. Il simbolo del dollaro è il nostro Wild, ha funzione di Jolly e sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter. Può comparire soltanto sui rulli 3, 4 e 5. Lo Scatter è rappresentato dalla coppa, se compare 3 volte in qualsiasi posizione regala ben 10 giri gratuiti. Durante i giri gratuiti, se il simbolo Wild appare sui rulli 2 o 4, tutti i simboli di questi rulli vengono trasformati in Wild. Inoltre, è possibile che appaia un rullo aggiuntivo su cui può trovarsi un moltiplicatore x2, x3, x5. Se durante i Free Spins compaiono 3 o più Scatter, allora verremo ricompensati con 5 ulteriori giri gratuiti.\n",

The scatter is the trophy, and three of these symbols anywhere on the reels will activate 10 free spins.

The game has a medium volatility, with frequent but small payouts. The RTP is slightly below the average, at 93.93%.

The Scatter symbol is a trophy that gives us 10 free spins if it appears three times. During free spins, the Wild symbol transforms all symbols on reels 2 and 4.

Ainsworth decided to celebrate this passion with an adrenaline-filled slot game, without any frills, featuring old-school gameplay and impressive graphics. The game is inspired by Fast and Furious-style car races, with shiny cars and roaring engines. The reels are located inside the car, and all the settings are on the digital display, making for a stunning visual experience. The sound is minimal, with no background music, just the sound of the reels interrupted by the sound of acceleration and braking in curves.\n\nFeatures of Flash Cash\nFor this slot game, Ainsworth decided to go for a traditional style without adding levels or special functions, but only regular symbols, as well as Wild, Scatter, and some multipliers to increase winnings. This is why the grid is a classic 5x3, with a maximum of 30 variable paylines - we can choose how many to activate. Naturally, a higher number of active lines translates into a higher probability of winning combinations. Moreover, the bets are quite contained, as for each active line, we pay just €0.01 (although we can go up to €100 per line). For those who prefer, it is possible to activate automatic spins by clicking on the \"+\" button next to the start button. In this case, a window will open with a scrolling cursor. The maximum number of automatic spins that can be activated is 100 without any limit to winnings or losses. The volatility is medium, with little but frequent wins, while we found the RTP slightly lower than the average, at 93.93%. It is useful to remember that this value only slightly affects the probability of winning and only after numerous plays.\n\nSymbols and features\nIn Flash Cash, we find both thematic and non-thematic symbols. The latter, represented by playing cards from 10 to Ace, are also the ones that pay the least. Next comes the helmet, the wheel, the speedometer, the checkered flag with the champagne bottle, and the race car. The dollar symbol is our Wild - it acts as a wildcard and replaces all symbols except Scatter. It can appear only on reels 3, 4, and 5. The Scatter is represented by a trophy - if it appears in any position three times, it gives us 10 free spins. During free spins, if the Wild symbol appears on reels 2 or 4, all symbols on these reels are transformed into Wilds. Moreover, an additional reel may appear, with a multiplier x2, x3, x5. If during the free spins, three or more Scatter symbols appear, we'll be rewarded with 5 additional free spins.\n            ",

The game includes regular symbols, Wilds, Scatters, and multipliers to increase winnings. Bets are quite contained, starting at €0.01 per active payline and can be adjusted up to €100 per line. Automatic spins can be activated and can reach up to 100 plays without any limit to winnings or losses.\n\nVolatility Level\n\nThe volatility in Flash Cash is medium, with little but frequent pays. This means that players can expect to win often, but these wins will be relatively small. However, larger wins can still occur, just not as frequently.\n\nBetting Options\n\nFlash Cash's betting options are quite flexible, with bets starting at €0.01 per active payline. Players can adjust their bets up to €100 per line. This flexibility allows both low and high rollers to enjoy the game without breaking the bank.\n\nFree Spins and Bonus Features\n\nPlayers can trigger free spins by landing three Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. This will award 10 free spins, during which Wild symbols appearing on reels 2 or 4 will transform all symbols on these reels into Wilds. Additionally, during free spins, a multiplier reel may appear, offering multipliers of x2, x3, or x5. If players land three or more Scatter symbols during free spins, they will receive an additional 5 free spins.\n\nRTP (Return to Player) Percentage\n\nFlash Cash's Return to Player (RTP) percentage is slightly lower than average, at 93.93%. While this value only slightly affects the probability of winning and only after numerous plays, it is still important for players to keep in mind when playing the game.\n\n        \n            ",

Ainsworth decided to celebrate this passion with an adrenaline-filled slot game, without any frills, featuring old-school gameplay and impressive graphics. The game is inspired by Fast and Furious-style car races, with shiny cars and roaring engines. The reels are located inside the car, and all the settings are on the digital display, making for a stunning visual experience. The sound is minimal, with no background music, just the sound of the reels interrupted by the sound of acceleration and braking in curves.\n\nFeatures of Flash Cash\nFor this slot game, Ainsworth decided to go for a traditional style without adding levels or special functions, but only regular symbols, as well as Wild, Scatter, and some multipliers to increase winnings. This is why the grid is a classic 5x3, with a maximum of 30 variable paylines - we can choose how many to activate. Naturally, a higher number of active lines translates into a higher probability of winning combinations. Moreover, the bets are quite contained, as for each active line, we pay just €0.01 (although we can go up to €100 per line). For those who prefer, it is possible to activate automatic spins by clicking on the \"+\" button next to the start button. In this case, a window will open with a scrolling cursor. The maximum number of automatic spins that can be activated is 100 without any limit to winnings or losses. The volatility is medium, with little but frequent wins, while we found the RTP slightly lower than the average, at 93.93%. It is useful to remember that this value only slightly affects the probability of winning and only after numerous plays.\n\nSymbols and features\nIn Flash Cash, we find both thematic and non-thematic symbols. The latter, represented by playing cards from 10 to Ace, are also the ones that pay the least. Next comes the helmet, the wheel, the speedometer, the checkered flag with the champagne bottle, and the race car. The dollar symbol is our Wild - it acts as a wildcard and replaces all symbols except Scatter. It can appear only on reels 3, 4, and 5. The Scatter is represented by a trophy - if it appears in any position three times, it gives us 10 free spins. During free spins, if the Wild symbol appears on reels 2 or 4, all symbols on these reels are transformed into Wilds. Moreover, an additional reel may appear, with a multiplier x2, x3, x5. If during the free spins, three or more Scatter symbols appear, we'll be rewarded with 5 additional free spins.\n            ",

Ainsworth decided to celebrate this passion with an adrenaline-filled slot game, without any frills, featuring old-school gameplay and impressive graphics. The game is inspired by Fast and Furious-style car races, with shiny cars and roaring engines. The reels are located inside the car, and all the settings are on the digital display, making for a stunning visual experience. The sound is minimal, with no background music, just the sound of the reels interrupted by the sound of acceleration and braking in curves.\n\nFeatures of Flash Cash\nFor this slot game, Ainsworth decided to go for a traditional style without adding levels or special functions, but only regular symbols, as well as Wild, Scatter, and some multipliers to increase winnings. This is why the grid is a classic 5x3, with a maximum of 30 variable paylines - we can choose how many to activate. Naturally, a higher number of active lines translates into a higher probability of winning combinations. Moreover, the bets are quite contained, as for each active line, we pay just €0.01 (although we can go up to €100 per line). For those who prefer, it is possible to activate automatic spins by clicking on the \"+\" button next to the start button. In this case, a window will open with a scrolling cursor. The maximum number of automatic spins that can be activated is 100 without any limit to winnings or losses. The volatility is medium, with little but frequent wins, while we found the RTP slightly lower than the average, at 93.93%. It is useful to remember that this value only slightly affects the probability of winning and only after numerous plays.\n\nSymbols and features\nIn Flash Cash, we find both thematic and non-thematic symbols. The latter, represented by playing cards from 10 to Ace, are also the ones that pay the least. Next comes the helmet, the wheel, the speedometer, the checkered flag with the champagne bottle, and the race car. The dollar symbol is our Wild - it acts as a wildcard and replaces all symbols except Scatter. It can appear only on reels 3, 4, and 5. The Scatter is represented by a trophy - if it appears in any position three times, it gives us 10 free spins. During free spins, if the Wild symbol appears on reels 2 or 4, all symbols on these reels are transformed into Wilds. Moreover, an additional reel may appear, with a multiplier x2, x3, x5. If during the free spins, three or more Scatter symbols appear, we'll be rewarded with 5 additional free spins.\n        ",
