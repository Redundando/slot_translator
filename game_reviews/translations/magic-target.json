All symbols have their own win multiplier, so check the paytable before placing bets. Additionally, the slot uses another group of symbols - card values from 10 to Ace, which often form lines and can bring small wins. There is also a set of extended game symbols in the Magic Target slot machine that will help you significantly increase your winnings: Wild is a Joker icon in a colorful hat that can fall on any game reel. Wild replaces any character on the line except for the Scatter; Scatter is a golden crown. If you collect a combo of 3 or more Scatters on the active line, you get 15 bonus spins, which can be restarted in the process. The winning multiplier for any combo obtained in the bonus round is x3. The cannon-shaped icon, falling on any cell of the field and participating in the active line, increases the win for each round by half. To receive the jackpot, you need to collect a line of 5 Jokers, playing at the highest possible odds.\n\nThe Magic Target slot machine game offers its players the opportunity to play 2 extra games:\n\nBonus Rounds – When 3 or more Scatter Bombs appear, 10 free spins are awarded. They can't be recovered, but during this feature, scatter cannon shots may appear, thereby multiplying the current round's winnings.\n\nGamble Mode – after every winning round, the bettor has the chance to gamble and in this way increase their earnings a few times. They will be given the chance to choose the red or black card. Choosing the right one will double their win. Choosing the wrong color will make them lose everything they won during that round. Additionally, there is an option to collect half the winnings from the current round.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nWazdan knows how to produce online gambling software like no other.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay and features of Magic Target\nSymbols and their values\nFree spins and multipliers\nWild and Scatter symbols\nGamble feature and jackpot\nMagic Target Deluxe – a sequel with higher RTP\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Magic Target\nTake aim and shoot to get fantastic special features and increase your winnings with Magic Target! This 5-reel online slot is a real bomb! Magic Target features 20 paylines and traditional cartoon-like symbols that enhance the game's retro atmosphere. Juicy fruits, golden crowns, bells, bombs, sevens, and wilds are waiting for you to help you win, so spin those reels!\n\nExplosive Graphics\nThe colorful graphics make Magic Target visually appealing, with golden stars floating above the warm red background. But looks aren't everything, right? That's why Magic Target offers fantastic bonuses to help you win more. So, if you enjoy classic vibes and colorful symbols but also want to increase your chances of winning big with interesting special features, you should try your luck with this slot.\n\nGet ready for a huge explosion once the bomb symbol lands on the reel as it represents the Scatter symbol. Not only does it pay in any position on the reels, but it also rewards you with 10 free spins - all you have to do is collect at least three Scatters anywhere on the reels from left to right, starting from the leftmost reel! Additionally, during Free Spins, cannon symbols that act as multipliers can land on the middle reel to double your win! And it doesn't end there! The slot also features the Wild Symbol, represented by the Joker, which replaces all symbols except for the Scatter and Multiplier to increase your chances of winning even more. And you'll be thrilled when you double your winnings with the gamble feature!\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nAs you might expect, the Magic Target free video slot features classic characters from 80s vintage slots, namely various fruits: oranges, grapes, cherries, plums, and pears. All symbols have their own win multiplier, so check the paytable before placing bets. Additionally, the slot uses another group of symbols - card values from 10 to Ace, which often form lines and can bring small wins. There is also a set of extended game symbols in the Magic Target slot machine that will help you significantly increase your winnings: Wild is a Joker icon in a colorful hat that can fall on any game reel. Wild replaces any character on the line except for the Scatter; Scatter is a golden crown. If you collect a combo of 3 or more Scatters on the active line, you get 15 bonus spins, which can be restarted in the process. The winning multiplier for any combo obtained in the bonus round is x3. The cannon-shaped icon, falling on any cell of the field and participating in the active line, increases the win for each round by half. To receive the jackpot, you need to collect a line of 5 Jokers, playing at the highest possible odds.\n\nThe Magic Target slot machine game offers its players the opportunity to play 2 extra games:\n\nBonus Rounds – When 3 or more Scatter Bombs appear, 10 free spins are awarded. They can't be recovered, but during this feature, scatter cannon shots may appear, thereby multiplying the current round's winnings.\n\nGamble Mode – after every winning round, the bettor has the chance to gamble and in this way increase their earnings a few times. They will be given the chance to choose the red or black card. Choosing the right one will double their win. Choosing the wrong color will make them lose everything they won during that round. Additionally, there is an option to collect half the winnings from the current round.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nWazdan knows how to produce online gambling software like no other. If you're interested in other titles from this slot machine producer similar to the one we just talked about, we suggest the sequel, Magic Target Deluxe, which maintains the same catchy graphics but offers new features and, above all, a even higher RTP percentage!\n            ",

During this feature, scatter cannon shots may appear, thereby multiplying the current round's winnings.\n\nGamble Feature\n\nAfter every winning round in Magic Target, bettors have the option to gamble and in this way increase their earnings a few times. They will be given the chance to choose between red or black card. Choosing the right one will double their win, while choosing the wrong color will make them lose everything they won during that round. Additionally, there is an option to collect half the winnings from the current round.\n\nJackpot and Sequel\n\nTo receive the jackpot in Magic Target, you need to collect a line of 5 Jokers, playing at the highest possible odds.

Additionally, during Free Spins, cannon symbols that act as multipliers can land on the middle reel to double your win! And it doesn't end there! The slot also features the Wild Symbol, represented by the Joker, which replaces all symbols except for the Scatter and Multiplier to increase your chances of winning even more. And you'll be thrilled when you double your winnings with the gamble feature!\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nAs you might expect, the Magic Target free video slot features classic characters from 80s vintage slots, namely various fruits: oranges, grapes, cherries, plums, and pears. All symbols have their own win multiplier, so check the paytable before placing bets. Additionally, the slot uses another group of symbols - card values from 10 to Ace, which often form lines and can bring small wins. There is also a set of extended game symbols in the Magic Target slot machine that will help you significantly increase your winnings: Wild is a Joker icon in a colorful hat that can fall on any game reel. Wild replaces any character on the line except for the Scatter; Scatter is a golden crown. If you collect a combo of 3 or more Scatters on the active line, you get 15 bonus spins, which can be restarted in the process. The winning multiplier for any combo obtained in the bonus round is x3. The cannon-shaped icon, falling on any cell of the field and participating in the active line, increases the win for each round by half. To receive the jackpot, you need to collect a line of 5 Jokers, playing at the highest possible odds.\n\nThe Magic Target slot machine game offers its players the opportunity to play 2 extra games:\n\nBonus Rounds – When 3 or more Scatter Bombs appear, 10 free spins are awarded. They can't be recovered, but during this feature, scatter cannon shots may appear, thereby multiplying the current round's winnings.\n\nGamble Mode – after every winning round, the bettor has the chance to gamble and in this way increase their earnings a few times. They will be given the chance to choose the red or black card. Choosing the right one will double their win. Choosing the wrong color will make them lose everything they won during that round. Additionally, there is an option to collect half the winnings from the current round.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nWazdan knows how to produce online gambling software like no other.
