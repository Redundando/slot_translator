Everyone knows the adventures of Jack, the boy who sold his cow for a bag of magic beans and became rich by stealing gold objects from the giant who lived on the beanstalk. \nThis slot, inspired by the fairy tale of the magic bean, has been developed with 3D technology and the result is a three-dimensional graphics with incredible effects, which makes it appear almost more like a role-playing game than a slot machine! \nIn the background we find the modest cottage where Jack lives with his mother and the large trunk of the beanstalk, at whose feet lies an axe, which plays a crucial role in defeating the giant. \nNot only the graphics, but also the gameplay system is very articulated, with several special features, including the \"Walking Wild\" one, in which Wild symbols \"walk\" on the reels until they disappear on the left side, offering free spins for the time of their exit.\n\nSymbols, Wilds and Scatters\nThe thematic symbols are those that refer to the fairy tale: in the foreground we find Jack, we then have the two-headed giant, a watering can to grow the beanstalk, the goat friend of the protagonist, the giant's treasure, the key to the chest and the axe with which Jack cuts down the plant defeating the wicked giant. \nAs often happens, in addition to the symbols related to the theme, we find the numbers and letters that represent the poker cards from 9 to Ace, drawn in green as if they were sprouts.\nThe Wild symbol is the protagonist of the story, Jack behaves like a joker and can replace all other symbols to complete a winning alignment. \nThe Scatter is the giant's treasure: if it appears at least three times on the reels, free spins are activated, and if Scatter symbols reappear during free spins, the game will continue for another 5 free spins. Additionally, if the Wild symbol appears during the free spins, all winnings obtained will be tripled. \nThe key represents the third special symbol: if it appears during free spins on the fifth reel, the \"Treasure Collection\" Bonus game will be unlocked, with extra Wilds including a bag of coins, a hen with golden eggs, and a golden harp, which correspond to additional prizes.\n\nOther slots inspired by fairy tales\nThe fairy tale theme is quite developed in the world of slot machines, and Jack and the Beanstalk is no exception! \nVery cute, also from NetEnt, is the Red Riding Hood slot, dedicated to the homonymous fairy tale, while for what concerns the story of the Three Little Pigs, we find two themed slots: one is Pigs and Bricks and the other is Big Bad Wolf. \nThere are also slot machines inspired by popular traditions: among those with an Irish theme, for example, we mention Rainbow Riches from Barcrest, Lucky Leprechaun from iSoftBet, and Irish Eyes from NextGen Gaming.\n            ",

Everyone knows the adventures of Jack, the boy who sold his cow for a bag of magic beans and became rich by stealing gold objects from the giant who lived on the beanstalk. \nThis slot, inspired by the fairy tale of the magic bean, has been developed with 3D technology and the result is a three-dimensional graphics with incredible effects, which makes it appear almost more like a role-playing game than a slot machine! \nIn the background we find the modest cottage where Jack lives with his mother and the large trunk of the beanstalk, at whose feet lies an axe, which plays a crucial role in defeating the giant. \nNot only the graphics, but also the gameplay system is very articulated, with several special features, including the \"Walking Wild\" one, in which Wild symbols \"walk\" on the reels until they disappear on the left side, offering free spins for the time of their exit.\n\nSymbols, Wilds and Scatters\nThe thematic symbols are those that refer to the fairy tale: in the foreground we find Jack, we then have the two-headed giant, a watering can to grow the beanstalk, the goat friend of the protagonist, the giant's treasure, the key to the chest and the axe with which Jack cuts down the plant defeating the wicked giant. \nAs often happens, in addition to the symbols related to the theme, we find the numbers and letters that represent the poker cards from 9 to Ace, drawn in green as if they were sprouts.\nThe Wild symbol is the protagonist of the story, Jack behaves like a joker and can replace all other symbols to complete a winning alignment. \nThe Scatter is the giant's treasure: if it appears at least three times on the reels, free spins are activated, and if Scatter symbols reappear during free spins, the game will continue for another 5 free spins. Additionally, if the Wild symbol appears during the free spins, all winnings obtained will be tripled. \nThe key represents the third special symbol: if it appears during free spins on the fifth reel, the \"Treasure Collection\" Bonus game will be unlocked, with extra Wilds including a bag of coins, a hen with golden eggs, and a golden harp, which correspond to additional prizes.\n\nOther slots inspired by fairy tales\nThe fairy tale theme is quite developed in the world of slot machines, and Jack and the Beanstalk is no exception! \nVery cute, also from NetEnt, is the Red Riding Hood slot, dedicated to the homonymous fairy tale, while for what concerns the story of the Three Little Pigs, we find two themed slots: one is Pigs and Bricks and the other is Big Bad Wolf. \nThere are also slot machines inspired by popular traditions: among those with an Irish theme, for example, we mention Rainbow Riches from Barcrest, Lucky Leprechaun from iSoftBet, and Irish Eyes from NextGen Gaming.\n            ",

Everyone knows the adventures of Jack, the boy who sold his cow for a bag of magic beans and became rich by stealing gold objects from the giant who lived on the beanstalk. \nThis slot, inspired by the fairy tale of the magic bean, has been developed with 3D technology and the result is a three-dimensional graphics with incredible effects, which makes it appear almost more like a role-playing game than a slot machine! \nIn the background we find the modest cottage where Jack lives with his mother and the large trunk of the beanstalk, at whose feet lies an axe, which plays a crucial role in defeating the giant. \nNot only the graphics, but also the gameplay system is very articulated, with several special features, including the \"Walking Wild\" one, in which Wild symbols \"walk\" on the reels until they disappear on the left side, offering free spins for the time of their exit.\n\nSymbols, Wilds and Scatters\nThe thematic symbols are those that refer to the fairy tale: in the foreground we find Jack, we then have the two-headed giant, a watering can to grow the beanstalk, the goat friend of the protagonist, the giant's treasure, the key to the chest and the axe with which Jack cuts down the plant defeating the wicked giant. \nAs often happens, in addition to the symbols related to the theme, we find the numbers and letters that represent the poker cards from 9 to Ace, drawn in green as if they were sprouts.\nThe Wild symbol is the protagonist of the story, Jack behaves like a joker and can replace all other symbols to complete a winning alignment. \nThe Scatter is the giant's treasure: if it appears at least three times on the reels, free spins are activated, and if Scatter symbols reappear during free spins, the game will continue for another 5 free spins. Additionally, if the Wild symbol appears during the free spins, all winnings obtained will be tripled. \nThe key represents the third special symbol: if it appears during free spins on the fifth reel, the \"Treasure Collection\" Bonus game will be unlocked, with extra Wilds including a bag of coins, a hen with golden eggs, and a golden harp, which correspond to additional prizes.\n\nOther slots inspired by fairy tales\nThe fairy tale theme is quite developed in the world of slot machines, and Jack and the Beanstalk is no exception! \nVery cute, also from NetEnt, is the Red Riding Hood slot, dedicated to the homonymous fairy tale, while for what concerns the story of the Three Little Pigs, we find two themed slots: one is Pigs and Bricks and the other is Big Bad Wolf. \nThere are also slot machines inspired by popular traditions: among those with an Irish theme, for example, we mention Rainbow Riches from Barcrest, Lucky Leprechaun from iSoftBet, and Irish Eyes from NextGen Gaming.\n            ",
