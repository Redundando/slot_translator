With bets ranging from 20p to €100 per spin on all devices, this serene underwater slot is all about the Free Spins feature, where you can start with up to 10 free spins. The amount of scatters you get to activate the feature will reward you with a maximum of 5 picks in which you can get extra free spins, stacked symbols, random wilds, a 2x multiplier, wilds and sticky wilds to increase your winning potential - with an option for the Golden Bet mode for an extra pick in the feature.\n\nThis aquatic-themed game immerses players in the serene depths of the sea as symbols float around a submarine habitat with 5 reels and 20 paylines oriented from left to right. Players are immediately drawn into the game's bright visuals and uplifting music. When the free spin mode is activated by three or more free spin symbols, 18 objects emerge from the depths of the tank and come to life for players to choose from. When the Golden Bet is selected, another object can be chosen. Each object contains a hidden feature that will be activated for the duration of the free spins.\n\nIf you thought sunken treasure chests were the only riches at the bottom of the ocean, think again. When you dive into the crevices of Golden Fish Tank, you'll be surrounded by a plethora of floating symbols. These icons are as active as the water that surrounds them, breaking free from the usual combination of borders and boxes. In fact, unlike almost any other slot game out there, Golden Fish Tank truly immerses you in a world of action. Literally diving into the game, the innovative interface makes you feel like you're spinning in a sea of serenity.\n\nFirstly, there is a Golden Bet feature that can be chosen which adds an extra 5 coins for each base game spin. The minimum bet would increase to 0.25€ per spin, while it would be worth 125€ per spin at maximum bet. Using it will give you an extra bet every time the Free Spins feature is activated.\n\nIn terms of feature selections, you can get multipliers, stacked symbols, blocks or random games or extra games:\n\n- An extra coin that awards an additional 2 or 4 free spins\n- Transform 1 of the fish into a stacked symbol on each free spin\n- Adding 1 or 2 random wilds to the reels on each free spin\n- Increasing all free spin wins with a 2x multiplier\n- Transforming 1 of the fish symbols into a wild every time it lands\n- Adding a wild to the reels that will remain frozen in position for the entire feature.\n\nIf you like interactivity in your slot games, then you'll find plenty to tickle your taste buds in Golden Fish Tank - it offers beautiful and relaxing design, smooth gameplay, and lots of extras. In terms of variety, it's in the middle and offers a maximum win of 400x bets per free spin.\n\nThat being said, the RTP is 96.4% when using the Golden Bet feature (compared to 95.9%), which means your bankroll should last long enough. The key to winning big is to get the 2x multiplier in the Free Spins feature as well as the random wild and stacked symbols. You can activate the feature with 5 scatters (with the Golden Bet feature) for all 6 extras that apply.\n\nHead deep under the waves in Golden Fish Tank, a peaceful underwater-themed slot. With symbols floating underwater, the reels are filled with card seed symbols and a quartet of brightly colored and well-drawn cartoon fishes.\n\nThe green fish and yellow fish are the most valuable, with 5 in combination rewarding you with 12.5x your total bet. There is also a wild symbol that substitutes for all symbols except for the free spin symbol.\n\nIf you like fishy slots, we recommend Playtech's Great Blue Jackpot and/or Blueprint Gaming's Fishin' Frenzy Megaways, which offer much larger potential wins. For example, Fishing Frenzy, a slot machine produced by Blueprint Gaming, offers an incredible RTP of 97%.",

If you use it, you will receive one extra bet every time the Free Spins feature is activated.\n\nAs for the feature picks, you can obtain multipliers, stacked symbols, blocks, or random games or extra games:\n\n- An extra coin that awards another 2 or 4 free spins\n- Transform 1 of the fish into a stacked symbol on every free spin\n- Add 1 or 2 random wilds to the reels on every free spin\n- Increase all free spin wins with a 2x multiplier\n- Transform 1 of the fish symbols into a wild every time it lands\n- Add a wild to reels that will remain frozen in position for the entire feature.\n\nIf you enjoy interactivity in your slot game, then you will find plenty to whet your appetite in Golden Fish Tank - it offers a beautiful and relaxing design, elegant gameplay, and plenty of extras. In terms of variety, it's in the middle and offers a maximum win of 400x bets for every free spin.\n\nThat being said, the RTP is 96.4% when using the Golden Bet feature (compared to 95.9%), which means that your bankroll should last long enough. The key to winning big is to get the 2x multiplier in the Free Spins feature, as well as the random wilds and stacked symbols. You can activate the feature with 5 scatters (with the Golden Bet feature) for all six extras that apply.\n\nDive deep beneath the waves in Golden Fish Tank, a tranquil underwater slot game. With symbols floating underwater, the reels are filled with card suits and a quartet of brightly colored and well-drawn cartoon fishes.\n\nThe green and yellow fish are the most valuable, with five of them in combination rewarding you with 12.5x your total bet. There is also a wild symbol that replaces all symbols except for the free spin symbol.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf you like fishy slots, we recommend Playtech's Great Blue Jackpot and/or Blueprint Gaming's Fishin’ Frenzy Megaways, which offer even bigger potential wins. For example, Blueprint Gaming's Fishing Frenzy slot machine offers an incredible RTP of 97%."

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGolden Fish Tank game overview\nFree Spins feature\nGolden Bet feature\nGameplay\nGraphics\nRTP\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Golden Fish Tank is a Yggdrasil Gaming-powered slot game with 5 reels and 20 paylines. With bets ranging from 20p to €100 per spin on all devices, this serene underwater slot is all about the Free Spins feature, where you can start with up to 10 free spins. The amount of scatters you get to activate the feature will reward you with a maximum of 5 picks in which you can get extra free spins, stacked symbols, random wilds, a 2x multiplier, wilds and sticky wilds to increase your winning potential - with an option for the Golden Bet mode for an extra pick in the feature.\n\nThis aquatic-themed game immerses players in the serene depths of the sea as symbols float around a submarine habitat with 5 reels and 20 paylines oriented from left to right. Players are immediately drawn into the game's bright visuals and uplifting music. When the free spin mode is activated by three or more free spin symbols, 18 objects emerge from the depths of the tank and come to life for players to choose from. When the Golden Bet is selected, another object can be chosen. Each object contains a hidden feature that will be activated for the duration of the free spins.\n\nIf you thought sunken treasure chests were the only riches at the bottom of the ocean, think again. When you dive into the crevices of Golden Fish Tank, you'll be surrounded by a plethora of floating symbols. These icons are as active as the water that surrounds them, breaking free from the usual combination of borders and boxes. In fact, unlike almost any other slot game out there, Golden Fish Tank truly immerses you in a world of action. Literally diving into the game, the innovative interface makes you feel like you're spinning in a sea of serenity.\n\nFirstly, there is a Golden Bet feature that can be chosen which adds an extra 5 coins for each base game spin. The minimum bet would increase to 0.25€ per spin, while it would be worth 125€ per spin at maximum bet. Using it will give you an extra bet every time the Free Spins feature is activated.\n\nIn terms of feature selections, you can get multipliers, stacked symbols, blocks or random games or extra games:\n\n- An extra coin that awards an additional 2 or 4 free spins\n- Transform 1 of the fish into a stacked symbol on each free spin\n- Adding 1 or 2 random wilds to the reels on each free spin\n- Increasing all free spin wins with a 2x multiplier\n- Transforming 1 of the fish symbols into a wild every time it lands\n- Adding a wild to the reels that will remain frozen in position for the entire feature.\n\nIf you like interactivity in your slot games, then you'll find plenty to tickle your taste buds in Golden Fish Tank - it offers beautiful and relaxing design, smooth gameplay, and lots of extras. In terms of variety, it's in the middle and offers a maximum win of 400x bets per free spin.\n\nThat being said, the RTP is 96.4% when using the Golden Bet feature (compared to 95.9%), which means your bankroll should last long enough. The key to winning big is to get the 2x multiplier in the Free Spins feature as well as the random wild and stacked symbols. You can activate the feature with 5 scatters (with the Golden Bet feature) for all 6 extras that apply.\n\nHead deep under the waves in Golden Fish Tank, a peaceful underwater-themed slot. With symbols floating underwater, the reels are filled with card seed symbols and a quartet of brightly colored and well-drawn cartoon fishes.\n\nThe green fish and yellow fish are the most valuable, with 5 in combination rewarding you with 12.5x your total bet. There is also a wild symbol that substitutes for all symbols except for the free spin symbol.\n\nIf you like fishy slots, we recommend Playtech's Great Blue Jackpot and/or Blueprint Gaming's Fishin' Frenzy Megaways, which offer much larger potential wins. For example, Fishing Frenzy, a slot machine produced by Blueprint Gaming, offers an incredible RTP of 97%.\n            ",

The game is powered by Yggdrasil Gaming and offers a serene underwater experience. The game's bright visuals, uplifting music, and innovative interface truly immerse you in a world of action. It's available across all devices, with bets ranging from 20p to €100 per spin.\n\nGameplay Mechanics and Features\n\nGolden Fish Tank immerses players in the serene depths of the sea as symbols float around a submarine habitat with 5 reels and 20 paylines oriented from left to right. The Free Spins feature is activated by three or more free spin symbols, where 18 objects emerge from the depths of the tank, offering hidden features that increase your winning potential. Additionally, Golden Bet is a feature that adds an extra 5 coins for each base game spin. Using it will give you an extra pick every time the Free Spins feature is activated.\n\nFree Spins Feature and its Benefits\n\nThe Free Spins feature rewards players with up to 10 free spins. The amount of scatters you get to activate the feature will reward you with a maximum of 5 picks in which you can get extra free spins, stacked symbols, random wilds, a 2x multiplier, wilds and sticky wilds to increase your winning potential. If you activate the feature with 5 scatters (with the Golden Bet feature), all 6 extras will be applied.\n\nGolden Bet Feature and its Benefits\n\nThe Golden Bet feature adds an extra 5 coins for each base game spin. The minimum bet would increase to 0.25€ per spin, while it would be worth 125€ per spin at maximum bet. Using it will give you an extra pick every time the Free Spins feature is activated. The RTP is 96.4% when using the Golden Bet feature (compared to 95.9%), which means your bankroll should last longer. Players can get an additional pick from each of the 5 hidden Feature Selections in the Free Spins feature when the Golden Bet feature is active.\n\nGame Graphics and Design\n\nGolden Fish Tank immerses players in an underwater paradise with its beautiful and relaxing design. The unique floating symbols create a world of action that makes the player feel like they are diving into a sea of serenity. The game's bright visuals and uplifting music immediately draws players into an underwater world. The design of the game is both innovative and interactive, providing players with a memorable underwater experience.\n\nRTP and Payout Information\n\nThe RTP for Golden Fish Tank is 96.4% when using the Golden Bet feature (compared to 95.9%). The game offers a maximum win of 400x bets per free spin. The key to winning big is to get the 2x multiplier in the Free Spins feature as well as the random wild and stacked symbols. The game offers medium variety and is suited for players who enjoy interactive slot games. If you're looking for fishy slots with larger potential wins, we recommend checking out Playtech's Great Blue Jackpot or Blueprint Gaming's Fishin' Frenzy Megaways, which offer an incredible RTP of 97%.\n\n        \n            ",

With bets ranging from 20p to €100 per spin on all devices, this serene underwater slot is all about the Free Spins feature, where you can start with up to 10 free spins. The amount of scatters you get to activate the feature will reward you with a maximum of 5 picks in which you can get extra free spins, stacked symbols, random wilds, a 2x multiplier, wilds and sticky wilds to increase your winning potential - with an option for the Golden Bet mode for an extra pick in the feature.\n\nThis aquatic-themed game immerses players in the serene depths of the sea as symbols float around a submarine habitat with 5 reels and 20 paylines oriented from left to right. Players are immediately drawn into the game's bright visuals and uplifting music. When the free spin mode is activated by three or more free spin symbols, 18 objects emerge from the depths of the tank and come to life for players to choose from. When the Golden Bet is selected, another object can be chosen. Each object contains a hidden feature that will be activated for the duration of the free spins.\n\nIf you thought sunken treasure chests were the only riches at the bottom of the ocean, think again. When you dive into the crevices of Golden Fish Tank, you'll be surrounded by a plethora of floating symbols. These icons are as active as the water that surrounds them, breaking free from the usual combination of borders and boxes. In fact, unlike almost any other slot game out there, Golden Fish Tank truly immerses you in a world of action. Literally diving into the game, the innovative interface makes you feel like you're spinning in a sea of serenity.\n\nFirstly, there is a Golden Bet feature that can be chosen which adds an extra 5 coins for each base game spin. The minimum bet would increase to 0.25€ per spin, while it would be worth 125€ per spin at maximum bet. Using it will give you an extra bet every time the Free Spins feature is activated.\n\nIn terms of feature selections, you can get multipliers, stacked symbols, blocks or random games or extra games:\n\n- An extra coin that awards an additional 2 or 4 free spins\n- Transform 1 of the fish into a stacked symbol on each free spin\n- Adding 1 or 2 random wilds to the reels on each free spin\n- Increasing all free spin wins with a 2x multiplier\n- Transforming 1 of the fish symbols into a wild every time it lands\n- Adding a wild to the reels that will remain frozen in position for the entire feature.\n\nIf you like interactivity in your slot games, then you'll find plenty to tickle your taste buds in Golden Fish Tank - it offers beautiful and relaxing design, smooth gameplay, and lots of extras. In terms of variety, it's in the middle and offers a maximum win of 400x bets per free spin.\n\nThat being said, the RTP is 96.4% when using the Golden Bet feature (compared to 95.9%), which means your bankroll should last long enough. The key to winning big is to get the 2x multiplier in the Free Spins feature as well as the random wild and stacked symbols. You can activate the feature with 5 scatters (with the Golden Bet feature) for all 6 extras that apply.\n\nHead deep under the waves in Golden Fish Tank, a peaceful underwater-themed slot. With symbols floating underwater, the reels are filled with card seed symbols and a quartet of brightly colored and well-drawn cartoon fishes.\n\nThe green fish and yellow fish are the most valuable, with 5 in combination rewarding you with 12.5x your total bet. There is also a wild symbol that substitutes for all symbols except for the free spin symbol.\n\nIf you like fishy slots, we recommend Playtech's Great Blue Jackpot and/or Blueprint Gaming's Fishin' Frenzy Megaways, which offer much larger potential wins. For example, Fishing Frenzy, a slot machine produced by Blueprint Gaming, offers an incredible RTP of 97%.\n            ",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a review of the game \"Golden Fish Tank\".\n\nPlease provide an FAQ:\n\n- 8 questions\n- Use simple language and provide practical takeaways.\n- Respond with a JSON!\n- Use the key \"faq\" and an array with the keys \"question\" and \"answer\". \n\nReview: Golden Fish Tank is a Yggdrasil Gaming-powered slot game with 5 reels and 20 paylines. With bets ranging from 20p to €100 per spin on all devices, this serene underwater slot is all about the Free Spins feature, where you can start with up to 10 free spins. The amount of scatters you get to activate the feature will reward you with a maximum of 5 picks in which you can get extra free spins, stacked symbols, random wilds, a 2x multiplier, wilds and sticky wilds to increase your winning potential - with an option for the Golden Bet mode for an extra pick in the feature.\n\nThis aquatic-themed game immerses players in the serene depths of the sea as symbols float around a submarine habitat with 5 reels and 20 paylines oriented from left to right. Players are immediately drawn into the game's bright visuals and uplifting music. When the free spin mode is activated by three or more free spin symbols, 18 objects emerge from the depths of the tank and come to life for players to choose from. When the Golden Bet is selected, another object can be chosen. Each object contains a hidden feature that will be activated for the duration of the free spins.\n\nIf you thought sunken treasure chests were the only riches at the bottom of the ocean, think again. When you dive into the crevices of Golden Fish Tank, you'll be surrounded by a plethora of floating symbols. These icons are as active as the water that surrounds them, breaking free from the usual combination of borders and boxes. In fact, unlike almost any other slot game out there, Golden Fish Tank truly immerses you in a world of action. Literally diving into the game, the innovative interface makes you feel like you're spinning in a sea of serenity.\n\nFirstly, there is a Golden Bet feature that can be chosen which adds an extra 5 coins for each base game spin. The minimum bet would increase to 0.25€ per spin, while it would be worth 125€ per spin at maximum bet. Using it will give you an extra bet every time the Free Spins feature is activated.\n\nIn terms of feature selections, you can get multipliers, stacked symbols, blocks or random games or extra games:\n\n- An extra coin that awards an additional 2 or 4 free spins\n- Transform 1 of the fish into a stacked symbol on each free spin\n- Adding 1 or 2 random wilds to the reels on each free spin\n- Increasing all free spin wins with a 2x multiplier\n- Transforming 1 of the fish symbols into a wild every time it lands\n- Adding a wild to the reels that will remain frozen in position for the entire feature.\n\nIf you like interactivity in your slot games, then you'll find plenty to tickle your taste buds in Golden Fish Tank - it offers beautiful and relaxing design, smooth gameplay, and lots of extras. In terms of variety, it's in the middle and offers a maximum win of 400x bets per free spin.\n\nThat being said, the RTP is 96.4% when using the Golden Bet feature (compared to 95.9%), which means your bankroll should last long enough. The key to winning big is to get the 2x multiplier in the Free Spins feature as well as the random wild and stacked symbols. You can activate the feature with 5 scatters (with the Golden Bet feature) for all 6 extras that apply.\n\nHead deep under the waves in Golden Fish Tank, a peaceful underwater-themed slot. With symbols floating underwater, the reels are filled with card seed symbols and a quartet of brightly colored and well-drawn cartoon fishes.\n\nThe green fish and yellow fish are the most valuable, with 5 in combination rewarding you with 12.5x your total bet. There is also a wild symbol that substitutes for all symbols except for the free spin symbol.\n\nIf you like fishy slots, we recommend Playtech's Great Blue Jackpot and/or Blueprint Gaming's Fishin' Frenzy Megaways, which offer much larger potential wins. For example, Fishing Frenzy, a slot machine produced by Blueprint Gaming, offers an incredible RTP of 97%.\n            ",
