The name of this legendary Irish figure comes from \"an\" meaning light, and light is indeed one of the defining features of this slot. The game grid is immersed in a forest where a soft purple light and many small glimmers can be seen.\n\nThe essential buttons are located at the bottom, including the bet changer, autoplay, and start buttons. By clicking on the gear symbol, you can access the internal menu, where all other settings, from reel acceleration to music deactivation, can be found.\n\nThis classic game has a 5-reel, 3-row grid, with 10 fixed paylines to place bets on starting at a minimum of €0.10. You win by matching identical symbols from left to right. If there are multiple combinations on a single line, only the highest payout will be awarded. If the combinations occur on different lines, the winnings will be added. Automatic spins can be activated, and advanced settings allow you to set limits beyond which autoplay stops. The theoretical return to player is 97%.\n\nLucky Lady Moon has different types of symbols. The basic ones are poker-playing cards, from nine to ace. The highest paying symbols, on the other hand, are related to the theme of the slot, such as the Irish tradition symbols of a clover, a horseshoe, a gold coin, a diamond, and a ladybug. The latter two also pay out with a combination of two symbols, while at least three are required for all the others.\n\nThere are two special symbols, the Wild and the Scatter. The Wild is Aine, and it acts as the joker, completing a winning combination by substituting for all symbols except the Scatter. It is also the highest paying symbol of the game, and when it appears, it multiplies winnings by 2! The Scatter is the moon. It too pays out, but its value is lower than the Wild, as well as the ladybug and the diamond. Depending on the number of Scatters landed on the reels, players can be rewarded with up to 15 Free Spins. The Scatter also adds a 3x multiplier.\n\nAnother feature in the game is Gamble, which allows you to double your winnings or lose them. Every time you get a winning combination, you will see two symbols at the bottom, one with a dollar sign and the other with two poker cards. With the first, you collect your winnings, with the latter, you risk losing them. At this point, the grid disappears, and a covered card appears in the center, with two buttons on the side. You must choose whether the middle card is red or black.\n\nIn summary, Lucky Lady Moon is a slot game that immerses players in a magical world of Celtic mythology, with many opportunities to win, including free spins, multipliers, and the added excitement of the Gamble feature.",

The name of this legendary Irish figure comes from \"an\" meaning light, and light is indeed one of the defining features of this slot. The game grid is immersed in a forest where a soft purple light and many small glimmers can be seen.\n\nThe essential buttons are located at the bottom, including the bet changer, autoplay, and start buttons. By clicking on the gear symbol, you can access the internal menu, where all other settings, from reel acceleration to music deactivation, can be found.\n\nThis classic game has a 5-reel, 3-row grid, with 10 fixed paylines to place bets on starting at a minimum of €0.10. You win by matching identical symbols from left to right. If there are multiple combinations on a single line, only the highest payout will be awarded. If the combinations occur on different lines, the winnings will be added. Automatic spins can be activated, and advanced settings allow you to set limits beyond which autoplay stops. The theoretical return to player is 97%.\n\nLucky Lady Moon has different types of symbols. The basic ones are poker-playing cards, from nine to ace. The highest paying symbols, on the other hand, are related to the theme of the slot, such as the Irish tradition symbols of a clover, a horseshoe, a gold coin, a diamond, and a ladybug. The latter two also pay out with a combination of two symbols, while at least three are required for all the others.\n\nThere are two special symbols, the Wild and the Scatter. The Wild is Aine, and it acts as the joker, completing a winning combination by substituting for all symbols except the Scatter. It is also the highest paying symbol of the game, and when it appears, it multiplies winnings by 2! The Scatter is the moon. It too pays out, but its value is lower than the Wild, as well as the ladybug and the diamond. Depending on the number of Scatters landed on the reels, players can be rewarded with up to 15 Free Spins. The Scatter also adds a 3x multiplier.\n\nAnother feature in the game is Gamble, which allows you to double your winnings or lose them. Every time you get a winning combination, you will see two symbols at the bottom, one with a dollar sign and the other with two poker cards. With the first, you collect your winnings, with the latter, you risk losing them. At this point, the grid disappears, and a covered card appears in the center, with two buttons on the side. You must choose whether the middle card is red or black.\n\nIn summary, Lucky Lady Moon is a slot game that immerses players in a magical world of Celtic mythology, with many opportunities to win, including free spins, multipliers, and the added excitement of the Gamble feature.\n            ",

You can place bets starting at a minimum of €0.10 and win by matching identical symbols from left to right. Multiple combinations on a single line will only award the highest payout, while combinations occurring on different lines add up the winnings. You can activate automatic spins and set limits beyond which autoplay stops. The theoretical return to player is 97%.\n\nSymbols\n\nLucky Lady Moon has a set of basic symbols represented by poker-playing cards from nine to ace. The highest paying symbols relate to the theme of the slot and include a clover, a horseshoe, a gold coin, a diamond, and a ladybug. The latter two also pay out with a combination of two symbols, while at least three are required for all the others. The Wild is Aine, the highest paying symbol of the game, which completes winning combinations and multiplies winnings by 2. The Scatter is the moon, which triggers Free Spins and adds a 3x multiplier.\n\nBonuses\n\nIn Lucky Lady Moon, players can receive up to 15 Free Spins by landing three or more Scatters on the reels. The Scatter also adds a 3x multiplier. The Gamble feature allows you to double your winnings or lose them by guessing the color of a covered card. The Wild, represented by Aine, not only triggers payouts but also multiplies them by 2.\n\nDesign\n\nLucky Lady Moon immerses players in a magical forest where a soft purple light and many small glimmers can be seen. The essential buttons, including the bet changer, autoplay, and start buttons, are located at the bottom of the screen, while advanced settings can be accessed by clicking the gear symbol. The game grid is easy to read, and symbols are designed to match the theme of Celtic mythology.\n\nRisk feature\n\nThe Gamble feature allows you to double your winnings or lose them by guessing the color of a covered card. Every time you win, two symbols appear at the bottom of the screen, one with a dollar sign and the other with two poker cards. With the first, you collect your winnings, with the latter, you risk losing them. The feature adds excitement and unpredictability to the game.\n\n        \n            ",

The name of this legendary Irish figure comes from \"an\" meaning light, and light is indeed one of the defining features of this slot. The game grid is immersed in a forest where a soft purple light and many small glimmers can be seen.\n\nThe essential buttons are located at the bottom, including the bet changer, autoplay, and start buttons. By clicking on the gear symbol, you can access the internal menu, where all other settings, from reel acceleration to music deactivation, can be found.\n\nThis classic game has a 5-reel, 3-row grid, with 10 fixed paylines to place bets on starting at a minimum of €0.10. You win by matching identical symbols from left to right. If there are multiple combinations on a single line, only the highest payout will be awarded. If the combinations occur on different lines, the winnings will be added. Automatic spins can be activated, and advanced settings allow you to set limits beyond which autoplay stops. The theoretical return to player is 97%.\n\nLucky Lady Moon has different types of symbols. The basic ones are poker-playing cards, from nine to ace. The highest paying symbols, on the other hand, are related to the theme of the slot, such as the Irish tradition symbols of a clover, a horseshoe, a gold coin, a diamond, and a ladybug. The latter two also pay out with a combination of two symbols, while at least three are required for all the others.\n\nThere are two special symbols, the Wild and the Scatter. The Wild is Aine, and it acts as the joker, completing a winning combination by substituting for all symbols except the Scatter. It is also the highest paying symbol of the game, and when it appears, it multiplies winnings by 2! The Scatter is the moon. It too pays out, but its value is lower than the Wild, as well as the ladybug and the diamond. Depending on the number of Scatters landed on the reels, players can be rewarded with up to 15 Free Spins. The Scatter also adds a 3x multiplier.\n\nAnother feature in the game is Gamble, which allows you to double your winnings or lose them. Every time you get a winning combination, you will see two symbols at the bottom, one with a dollar sign and the other with two poker cards. With the first, you collect your winnings, with the latter, you risk losing them. At this point, the grid disappears, and a covered card appears in the center, with two buttons on the side. You must choose whether the middle card is red or black.\n\nIn summary, Lucky Lady Moon is a slot game that immerses players in a magical world of Celtic mythology, with many opportunities to win, including free spins, multipliers, and the added excitement of the Gamble feature.\n            ",
