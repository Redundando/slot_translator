Prepare to be amazed by the Trail Bonus and Free Spins.</p><p>The Trail Bonus is what we all signed up for when we started playing this game. Triggered by three or more scatter symbols, this game could potentially lead you to a jackpot of 2,000 times your bet or more! This bonus round is like a mini game within the game. The graphics are top-notch, and the anticipation of potentially winning big is exhilarating!</p><p>As if the Trail Bonus wasn't enough, Armadillo Goes West also offers free spins! These are activated by the same trigger as the Trail Bonus: three or more scatter symbols. During the three bonus rounds of free spins, you're guaranteed a random feature. That extra little bit of excitement and unpredictability makes this game even more fun to play.</p><p>Oh, and let's not forget about the Golden Bet function. This function increases your chances of activating random features during the base game. We highly recommend trying it out, even if it means betting a little extra.</p><p>For those of you who want to speed things up, there's also a Bonus Buy function. This function allows you to enter the Trail Bonus round right away, but it's going to cost you an extra 42 times your existing bet amount. But hey, you're not here just to save money, are you?</p><p>To sum it up, Armadillo Goes West knows how to keep things interesting, and its bonus features are a big part of that. Try it out today and enjoy the thrill of adventures in the Wild West, right from the comfort of your couch!</p>\"\n}"
