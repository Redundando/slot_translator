From action movies, cuisine to even decorating with Feng Shui, the world of slots has also been fascinated by China. Feng Fu, an online slot by Tom Horn, presents the Chinese symbolism of wealth and fortune. Let's begin with the graphics.\n\nAs soon as the game screen appears, we are transported to ancient China. The background is reminiscent of ink paintings featuring a landscape of mountains, trees, and even a glimpse of the Great Wall of China. The game grid showcases typical details such as pagoda roofs and bamboo scrolls acting as reels on which symbols scroll.\n\nLet's talk about the symbols as they are crucial to any slot. In Feng Fu, they deserve more attention for their stunning depiction. The symbols include Chinese zodiac animals such as the monkey, rooster, and goat. Furthermore, two animals are considered prosperity bringers in Chinese culture, the carp, and the maneki-neko, a lucky cat. However, there is also a rather bold choice of replacing the classical card symbols with Chinese ideograms, which might take away some meaning from the slot for the Western audience.\n\nFinally, speaking of the technical part of the game, Feng Fu employs the usual 5x3 mechanism commonly found not only in Tom Horn's catalog but also in online slots in general. The pay lines are nine, which implies a lower number of wins but with a higher value. One of the challenges in gameplay would be mastering the various symbols due to the presence of many Chinese characters. In an attempt to be of service, we remind you of the two special symbols: the yin and yang serve as scatter symbols enabling access to bonus features. Meanwhile, a decorative gong or plate appears as the wild symbol, which replaces all normal symbols within the game.\n\nSimilar slots to Feng Fu include Benny the Panda, which features more accessible ideograms, while Chinese New Year and Choy Sun Doa cater to the same oriental theme.",

The game design features ink paintings of typical Chinese elements such as mountains, trees, pagoda roofs, and bamboo scrolls representing the reels, making you feel like you are in ancient China. The game symbols are the animals of the Chinese zodiac, and two animals considered lucky in Chinese culture: the carp and maneki-neko.\n\nLucky animals and Chinese zodiac\n\nFeng Fu's symbols are inspired by the animals of the Chinese zodiac, such as the monkey, rooster, and goat, along with two animals considered lucky in Chinese culture: the carp and maneki-neko. The symbols represent the game's theme of luck and wealth. \n\nUse of Chinese ideograms\n\nFeng Fu takes a daring and unusual choice by replacing traditional playing card symbols with Chinese ideograms. The ideograms may confuse players not familiar with the language. However, it adds an extra layer of depth to the game's meaning, making it perfect for players with an interest in Chinese culture.\n\nGameplay mechanics\n\nFeng Fu is a traditional 5x3 online slot game with nine pay lines. With more pay lines, winning combinations are more difficult to achieve, but the value of the winnings is higher. The scatter symbol in the game is the Yin and Yang sign, which allows players to access the bonus function. Additionally, there is a gong or plate that acts as a scatter and wild symbol, substituting all the regular symbols. The game is perfect for experienced slot players looking to tackle new challenges.\n\nDifficulty for new players\n\nFor new players, the use of Chinese ideograms may make it difficult to distinguish between symbols and thus affect gameplay experience. However, once players familiarize themselves with the symbols, the gameplay is not too challenging. Also, the inclusion of the gong or plate symbol acting as a scatter and wild symbol makes it easier to achieve winning combinations. For a more accessible version of ideograms, players can try other oriental-themed slot games such as Benny the Panda.\n\n        \n            ",

While this decision might confuse an Occidental audience that is not familiar with the language, it adds an extra layer of depth to the game's overall meaning.\nLast but not least, regarding the sound effects, the background music is typical Chinese, perfectly in tune with the Feng Fu theme.\nNow, let's delve into the technical aspects of this slot machine.\n\"Feng Fu\" - Traditional China\nDespite the ideograms that might confuse new players, Feng Fu relies on the same 5x3 mechanism as other Tom Horn titles. Feng Fu has 9 pay lines, which means that winning combinations are more difficult to achieve, but their value is higher.\nThe main difficulty lies in mastering the various symbols, given the presence of numerous Chinese characters that might not help in distinguishing one from another. Nevertheless, you should remember two special symbols: the Yin and Yang sign, acting as a scatter symbol (allowing players to access the bonus function), and a finely decorated gong or plate, acting as a scatter and wild symbol (substituting all regular symbols).\nIf you're a fan of oriental-themed slots, you might want to check out other titles, such as Benny the Panda, which offers a more accessible version of the ideograms, or Chinese New Year and Choy Sun Doa, which cater to a similar taste.\n        ",
