The free spin bonus has a symbol upgrade feature, and there are two symbols that are worth 10,000x on a winning payline. Players need either scatters, scatter wilds, or the wild symbol to win big.\n\nVisuals/Graphics\n\nThe graphics in Dawn of Egypt are stunning. The symbols include a blue lotus flower, an ankh, a scorpion, a snake, and two deities, Osiris and Maahes, the lion god. The rest are royal cards made with impeccable gemstone designs. Each winning combination results in a burst of light and golden dust around the symbols.\n\nEgyptian Theme\n\nPlay'n GO never fails to impress with their Ancient Egypt themed slots, and Dawn of Egypt is no exception. This slot is a treasure trove for history lovers.\n\nWinning Symbols\n\nThe scatter wild and regular scatter symbols both pay 100x for five on a payline, while the regular scatter symbol pays 1000x on the winning bet when five of the same fall somewhere on the reels. The highest paying symbols on the paytable include Osiris paying 100x for five symbols on a winning payline, followed by the lion king symbol with a payout of 40x and the snake and scorpion with a payout of 20x.\n\nRecommendations\n\nOverall, Dawn of Egypt is a must-play slot game for any slot lover. We suggest giving Ankh of Anubis, also produced by Play N Go, a try with its staggering 576 paylines.\n\n        \n            ",

With the chance to win up to 5000x your bet, it features ten fixed paylines and five reels that reveal scatters, wild symbols, and wilds. The free spin bonus has a symbol upgrade feature, and there are two symbols that are worth 10,000x on a winning payline.\n\nPlay'n GO never fails to impress with their Ancient Egypt themed slots, and Dawn of Egypt is no exception. Every aspect of the game is crafted to perfection, making it stand out from other slots in the same theme.\n\nThis slot is a treasure trove for history lovers. The graphics are stunning, and the symbols include a blue lotus flower, an ankh, a scorpion, a snake, and two deities – Osiris and Maahes, the lion god. The rest are royal cards made with impeccable gemstone designs. Every winning combination results in a burst of light and golden dust around the symbols.\n\nTo make big wins in this fantastic online slot game, players need either scatters, scatter wilds, or the wild symbol. The two regular symbols that pay the most can be replaced by either the wild or the wild scatter. The luckiest of players can even win a maximum payout of 5000x their bet.\n\nFor the bonus free spins, three or more scatter symbols of the golden pyramid that emits an electric glow trigger the Wheel of the Gods. Here, players can win from three to 20 free spins. During this bonus round, each scatter symbol results in an upgrade of a randomly selected symbol to the one next on the value scale.\n\nIn addition to the base wins with three or more matching symbols, the game has a bonus feature and modifiers. The highest paying symbols on the paytable include Osiris in the pharaoh role, paying 100x for five symbols on a winning payline, followed by the lion king symbol with a payout of 40x and the snake and scorpion with a payout of 20x.\n\nThe scatter wild and regular scatter symbols both pay 100x for five on a payline, while the regular scatter symbol pays 1000x on the winning bet when five of the same fall somewhere on the reels.\n\nOverall, there are many Egyptian-themed slots online, but Dawn of Egypt is on another level. We suggest giving Ankh of Anubis, also produced by Play N Go, a try with its staggering 576 paylines.\n        ",
