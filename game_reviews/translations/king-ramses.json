He deserved to have a pyramid built in his name, but he did not pursue such a program. Instead, he built cities and signed a peace treaty. These are certainly good reasons to immortalize him in a slot game that has three jackpots. So we have King Ramses, a slot game created by Ainsworth's slot experts that plays on five reels, three rows, and 25 always-active paylines.\n\nWe know the theme, but do we know the details? This is a game that has everything needed for a majestic gaming experience.

All image symbols have the power to evoke the feeling of being inside a royal palace, all plated in gold and decorated with precious stones.

What's astounding is the lowest bet per spin - that of €1.25 per spin, so players who aren't ready to spend such money on a single bet will avoid the King Ramses slot.\n\nBut there is a reason why that bet is so high: the game has three jackpots, so it is natural that these are not given for a few cents. Another detail is that the jackpots progress with the size of the bet, but they are not progressive in the technical understanding of the term \"progressive jackpot.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the most expensive bet is not that expensive, so let's see what Ainsworth has done with this game. Raise the minimum bet, but do not raise the maximum bet, so that a range of players can engage in a high bet on a game that is not at all high bet, but on the other hand can provide a fairly consistent payout.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nYggdrasil draws on some of the most beloved images of Ancient Egypt with their Valley of the Gods slot.

Ciò che sbalordisce è la scommessa più bassa per giro – quella di 1,25 euro per giro, quindi i giocatori che non sono pronti a spendere tali soldi per una singola scommessa eviteranno la slot King Ramses.\nMa c’è una ragione per cui quella scommessa è così alta: il gioco ha tre jackpot, quindi è naturale che questi non vengano dati per pochi centesimi. Un altro dettaglio è che i jackpot progrediscono con l’entità della scommessa, ma non sono progressivi nella comprensione tecnica del termine “jackpot progressivo”.\nD’altra parte, la scommessa più costosa non è così costosa, quindi vediamo cosa ha fatto Ainsworth con questo gioco. Alzare la puntata minima, ma non alzare la puntata massima, in modo che una serie di giocatori possa impegnarsi in una scommessa ad alta puntata su un gioco che non è affatto ad alta puntata, ma che d’altra parte può fornire un payout piuttosto consistente.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nYggdrasil si avvale di alcune delle immagini più amate dell’Antico Egitto con la loro slot Valley of the Gods. Ogni vincita garantirà una respin per aiutarvi a raccogliere il maggior numero possibile di premi. Combatti il tuo cammino attraverso i bloccanti per liberare gli scarabei e un moltiplicatore di vincita.\nLegend of the Pharaohs di Barcrest è il gioco perfetto per tutti coloro che amano le slot classiche con un colpo di scena. Questo gioco ha molteplici bonus che si possono attivare oltre ai giri gratuiti. Potreste anche provare la funzione Big Bet gamble per sbloccare più giri gratuiti con bonus più alti.\n\n        ",

There are also free spins and scatter wins to keep all types of players happy. This game offers plenty of surprises to keep any aspiring Egyptian happy. Ainsworth loves developing slots with simple mechanics that all players can get behind. We are sure they have done exactly that with their slot game King Ramses.\n\nInterested? Keep reading our review of the King Ramses online slot to learn more about this game.\n\nA graphic masterpiece for Ancient Egypt enthusiasts\n\nAinsworth takes us back to the time of Ancient Egypt, when Ramses ruled the land and raised it to new levels of glory. He deserved a pyramid built in his name, but he did not pursue such a program. Instead, he built cities and signed a peace treaty. These are certainly good reasons to immortalize him in a slot game that has three jackpots. And so we have King Ramses, a slot created by the experts at Ainsworth that plays on five reels, three rows and 25 paylines always in action.\n\nWe know the theme, but do we know the details? This is a game that has everything needed for a majestic gaming experience. With a payout of 10,000x on the symbol payline, jackpots are not the only lucrative prizes that can be won on King Ramses. While the reel set is not fully animated, image symbols come to life when they become part of a winning combination. All image symbols have the power to evoke the feeling of being inside a royal palace, all plated in gold and decorated with precious stones. So let’s take a look at how to set up for the game.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe main bonus feature of the King Ramses slot machine is the free spin feature. They can be triggered using the Ramses Scatter symbol. You can earn up to 25 free spins when you initially activate them and 5 additional spins for every 2 scatters you land during these spins.\n\nThe other feature that our reviewers thought could capture players’ interest is the Bonus. This will lead a player to take the Minor, Maxi or Major jackpot. The Minor bonus is awarded with a 5 of a kind plus a wild and the Bonus scatter in the sixth reel. The Maxi bonus is awarded with 5 symbols of a low-paying type, no wilds, and a Triple Hit bonus. Finally, the Major can be won with 5 symbols of a unique type, no wilds, and - of course - a Bonus scatter. With a maximum of 10,000 credits at stake with this feature, it can add a real boost to your wins with this game.\n\nAinsworth knows how to put together interesting and unique bonuses. If you want to try some of their other games, check out some of our favorites below.\n\nThe game setting simply requires selecting a value for the bet, from the Total Bet setting. The game's 25 paylines are always active, so line bets are automatically calculated. What is astonishing is the lowest bet per spin - that of €1.25 per spin - so players who are not ready to spend such money on a single bet will avoid the King Ramses slot machine.\n\nBut there is a reason why that bet is so high: the game has three jackpots, so it is natural that these are not given away for a few cents. Another detail is that the jackpots progress with the size of the bet, but they are not technically progressive in the understanding of the term \"progressive jackpot\".\n\nOn the other hand, the most expensive bet is not that expensive, so let's see what Ainsworth has done with this game. Raise the minimum bet, but don’t raise the maximum bet, so that a range of players can engage in a high-stakes bet on a game that is not high stakes at all, but on the other hand can provide a rather consistent payout.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nYggdrasil uses some of the most beloved images of Ancient Egypt with their Valley of the Gods slot. Every win will guarantee a respin to help you collect as many prizes as possible. Fight your way through the blockers to free the scarabs and a winning multiplier.\n\nBarcrest's Legend of the Pharaohs is the perfect game for anyone who loves classic slots with a twist. This game has multiple bonuses that can be triggered in addition to free spins. You could also try the Big Bet gamble feature to unlock more free spins with higher bonuses."

Ainsworth loves developing slots with simple mechanics that all players can get behind. We are sure they have done exactly that with their slot game King Ramses.\n\nInterested? Keep reading our review of the King Ramses online slot to learn more about this game.\n\nA graphic masterpiece for Ancient Egypt enthusiasts\n\nAinsworth takes us back to the time of Ancient Egypt, when Ramses ruled the land and raised it to new levels of glory. He deserved a pyramid built in his name, but he did not pursue such a program. Instead, he built cities and signed a peace treaty. These are certainly good reasons to immortalize him in a slot game that has three jackpots. And so we have King Ramses, a slot created by the experts at Ainsworth that plays on five reels, three rows and 25 paylines always in action.\n\nWe know the theme, but do we know the details? This is a game that has everything needed for a majestic gaming experience. With a payout of 10,000x on the symbol payline, jackpots are not the only lucrative prizes that can be won on King Ramses. While the reel set is not fully animated, image symbols come to life when they become part of a winning combination. All image symbols have the power to evoke the feeling of being inside a royal palace, all plated in gold and decorated with precious stones. So let’s take a look at how to set up for the game.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe main bonus feature of the King Ramses slot machine is the free spin feature. They can be triggered using the Ramses Scatter symbol. You can earn up to 25 free spins when you initially activate them and 5 additional spins for every 2 scatters you land during these spins.\n\nThe other feature that our reviewers thought could capture players’ interest is the Bonus. This will lead a player to take the Minor, Maxi or Major jackpot. The Minor bonus is awarded with a 5 of a kind plus a wild and the Bonus scatter in the sixth reel. The Maxi bonus is awarded with 5 symbols of a low-paying type, no wilds, and a Triple Hit bonus. Finally, the Major can be won with 5 symbols of a unique type, no wilds, and - of course - a Bonus scatter. With a maximum of 10,000 credits at stake with this feature, it can add a real boost to your wins with this game.\n\nAinsworth knows how to put together interesting and unique bonuses. If you want to try some of their other games, check out some of our favorites below.\n\nThe game setting simply requires selecting a value for the bet, from the Total Bet setting. The game's 25 paylines are always active, so line bets are automatically calculated. What is astonishing is the lowest bet per spin - that of €1.25 per spin - so players who are not ready to spend such money on a single bet will avoid the King Ramses slot machine.\n\nBut there is a reason why that bet is so high: the game has three jackpots, so it is natural that these are not given away for a few cents. Another detail is that the jackpots progress with the size of the bet, but they are not technically progressive in the understanding of the term \"progressive jackpot\".\n\nOn the other hand, the most expensive bet is not that expensive, so let's see what Ainsworth has done with this game. Raise the minimum bet, but don’t raise the maximum bet, so that a range of players can engage in a high-stakes bet on a game that is not high stakes at all, but on the other hand can provide a rather consistent payout.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nYggdrasil uses some of the most beloved images of Ancient Egypt with their Valley of the Gods slot. Every win will guarantee a respin to help you collect as many prizes as possible. Fight your way through the blockers to free the scarabs and a winning multiplier.\n\nBarcrest's Legend of the Pharaohs is the perfect game for anyone who loves classic slots with a twist. This game has multiple bonuses that can be triggered in addition to free spins. You could also try the Big Bet gamble feature to unlock more free spins with higher bonuses.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay features\n\nKing Ramses slot game features five reels and 25 paylines. The game includes stacked Wild symbols and a free spins bonus, which can be triggered using the Ramses Scatter symbol. Players can earn up to 25 free spins when activating the feature and receive 5 additional spins for every 2 scatters landed during the free spins. The game also offers three jackpots, which can be triggered using the Minor, Maxi, or Major bonus.\n\nJackpots\n\nKing Ramses casino game offers three jackpots to grab with Ainsworth's special feature. The Minor bonus is awarded with a 5 of a kind plus a wild and the Bonus scatter in the sixth reel. The Maxi bonus is awarded with 5 symbols of a low-paying type, no wilds, and a Triple Hit bonus. The Major can be won with 5 symbols of a unique type, no wilds, and a Bonus scatter. With a maximum of 10,000 credits at stake with this feature, it can add a real boost to your wins with this game. The jackpots progress with the size of the bet, but they are not technically progressive in the sense of the term.\n\nFree spins bonus\n\nIn the King Ramses slot machine, the main bonus feature is the free spin feature. By landing the Ramses Scatter symbol, players can trigger up to 25 free spins initially and can receive 5 additional spins for every 2 scatters landed during the free spins. This feature offers players more opportunities to land winning combinations and is a popular feature among slot game enthusiasts.\n\nDesign and graphics\n\nThe King Ramses online slot has an Ancient Egyptian theme and is created by the experts at Ainsworth. The game's symbols are decked in gold and decorated with precious stones, creating a sense of opulence. All image symbols can evoke the feeling of being inside a royal palace, and though the reel set is not fully animated, the image symbols come to life when they become part of a winning combination. The graphics and designs of the game can please the eyes of Ancient Egypt enthusiasts quite well.\n\nSymbol payouts\n\nThe symbol payouts for the King Ramses slot can translate to lucrative prizes. The payout for the highest symbol on a payline is 10,000x the player's line bet. The symbols include images such as a Pharaoh, a statue of Anubis, a scarab beetle, the Eye of Ra, and playing card symbols. The image symbols are more valuable than the playing card symbols, but landing any winning combination can translate to a payout.\n\nBetting sizes\n\nThe King Ramses slot game's Total Bet setting allows players to select the value for their bet. The game's 25 paylines are always active, so line bets are automatically calculated. The lowest bet per spin is €1.25, and the highest bet per spin is €25. The range of betting sizes allows different types of players to engage in a high-stakes bet on a game that is not high stakes at all. The reason why the minimum bet is high is that the game has three jackpots, and they are not given away for a few cents.\n\nConsistent payout percentage\n\nThe King Ramses slot machine has a theoretical player return percentage of 94.31%, which is a consistent payout ratio. The game's mechanics, payouts, and bonuses are straightforward, and Ainsworth loves developing slots with simple mechanics that all players can get behind. Players can land winning combinations in different ways, including via the free spins bonus and the jackpots. Winning combinations can offer consistent payouts.\n\nCreator of the game (Ainsworth)\n\nThe King Ramses slot machine is created by Ainsworth, a leading slot game provider in the market. Ainsworth knows how to put together interesting and unique bonuses for players. They are also behind other popular slot games, such as Panda King, Mustang Money, and Electric Nights. King Ramses is another exemplary game from Ainsworth that plays on five reels, three rows, and 25 paylines with exciting bonus features and jackpots to keep players entertained for hours.\n\n        \n            ",

There are also free spins and scatter wins to keep all types of players happy. This game offers plenty of surprises to keep any aspiring Egyptian happy. Ainsworth loves developing slots with simple mechanics that all players can get behind. We are sure they have done exactly that with their slot game King Ramses.\n\nInterested? Keep reading our review of the King Ramses online slot to learn more about this game.\n\nA graphic masterpiece for Ancient Egypt enthusiasts\n\nAinsworth takes us back to the time of Ancient Egypt, when Ramses ruled the land and raised it to new levels of glory. He deserved a pyramid built in his name, but he did not pursue such a program. Instead, he built cities and signed a peace treaty. These are certainly good reasons to immortalize him in a slot game that has three jackpots. And so we have King Ramses, a slot created by the experts at Ainsworth that plays on five reels, three rows and 25 paylines always in action.\n\nWe know the theme, but do we know the details? This is a game that has everything needed for a majestic gaming experience. With a payout of 10,000x on the symbol payline, jackpots are not the only lucrative prizes that can be won on King Ramses. While the reel set is not fully animated, image symbols come to life when they become part of a winning combination. All image symbols have the power to evoke the feeling of being inside a royal palace, all plated in gold and decorated with precious stones. So let’s take a look at how to set up for the game.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe main bonus feature of the King Ramses slot machine is the free spin feature. They can be triggered using the Ramses Scatter symbol. You can earn up to 25 free spins when you initially activate them and 5 additional spins for every 2 scatters you land during these spins.\n\nThe other feature that our reviewers thought could capture players’ interest is the Bonus. This will lead a player to take the Minor, Maxi or Major jackpot. The Minor bonus is awarded with a 5 of a kind plus a wild and the Bonus scatter in the sixth reel. The Maxi bonus is awarded with 5 symbols of a low-paying type, no wilds, and a Triple Hit bonus. Finally, the Major can be won with 5 symbols of a unique type, no wilds, and - of course - a Bonus scatter. With a maximum of 10,000 credits at stake with this feature, it can add a real boost to your wins with this game.\n\nAinsworth knows how to put together interesting and unique bonuses. If you want to try some of their other games, check out some of our favorites below.\n\nThe game setting simply requires selecting a value for the bet, from the Total Bet setting. The game's 25 paylines are always active, so line bets are automatically calculated. What is astonishing is the lowest bet per spin - that of €1.25 per spin - so players who are not ready to spend such money on a single bet will avoid the King Ramses slot machine.\n\nBut there is a reason why that bet is so high: the game has three jackpots, so it is natural that these are not given away for a few cents. Another detail is that the jackpots progress with the size of the bet, but they are not technically progressive in the understanding of the term \"progressive jackpot\".\n\nOn the other hand, the most expensive bet is not that expensive, so let's see what Ainsworth has done with this game. Raise the minimum bet, but don’t raise the maximum bet, so that a range of players can engage in a high-stakes bet on a game that is not high stakes at all, but on the other hand can provide a rather consistent payout.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nYggdrasil uses some of the most beloved images of Ancient Egypt with their Valley of the Gods slot. Every win will guarantee a respin to help you collect as many prizes as possible. Fight your way through the blockers to free the scarabs and a winning multiplier.\n\nBarcrest's Legend of the Pharaohs is the perfect game for anyone who loves classic slots with a twist. This game has multiple bonuses that can be triggered in addition to free spins. You could also try the Big Bet gamble feature to unlock more free spins with higher bonuses.\n            ",

This slot is truly fit for a king. The symbols drip with gold, creating a very opulent game that will surely attract many types of players.\n\nThis game offers three jackpots to grab with Ainsworth's special feature. There are also free spins and scatter wins to keep all types of players happy. This game offers plenty of surprises to keep any aspiring Egyptian happy. Ainsworth loves developing slots with simple mechanics that all players can get behind. We are sure they have done exactly that with their slot game King Ramses.\n\nInterested? Keep reading our review of the King Ramses online slot to learn more about this game.\n\nA graphic masterpiece for Ancient Egypt enthusiasts\n\nAinsworth takes us back to the time of Ancient Egypt, when Ramses ruled the land and raised it to new levels of glory. He deserved a pyramid built in his name, but he did not pursue such a program. Instead, he built cities and signed a peace treaty. These are certainly good reasons to immortalize him in a slot game that has three jackpots. And so we have King Ramses, a slot created by the experts at Ainsworth that plays on five reels, three rows and 25 paylines always in action.\n\nWe know the theme, but do we know the details? This is a game that has everything needed for a majestic gaming experience. With a payout of 10,000x on the symbol payline, jackpots are not the only lucrative prizes that can be won on King Ramses. While the reel set is not fully animated, image symbols come to life when they become part of a winning combination. All image symbols have the power to evoke the feeling of being inside a royal palace, all plated in gold and decorated with precious stones. So let’s take a look at how to set up for the game.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe main bonus feature of the King Ramses slot machine is the free spin feature. They can be triggered using the Ramses Scatter symbol. You can earn up to 25 free spins when you initially activate them and 5 additional spins for every 2 scatters you land during these spins.\n\nThe other feature that our reviewers thought could capture players’ interest is the Bonus. This will lead a player to take the Minor, Maxi or Major jackpot. The Minor bonus is awarded with a 5 of a kind plus a wild and the Bonus scatter in the sixth reel. The Maxi bonus is awarded with 5 symbols of a low-paying type, no wilds, and a Triple Hit bonus. Finally, the Major can be won with 5 symbols of a unique type, no wilds, and - of course - a Bonus scatter. With a maximum of 10,000 credits at stake with this feature, it can add a real boost to your wins with this game.\n\nAinsworth knows how to put together interesting and unique bonuses. If you want to try some of their other games, check out some of our favorites below.\n\nThe game setting simply requires selecting a value for the bet, from the Total Bet setting. The game's 25 paylines are always active, so line bets are automatically calculated. What is astonishing is the lowest bet per spin - that of €1.25 per spin - so players who are not ready to spend such money on a single bet will avoid the King Ramses slot machine.\n\nBut there is a reason why that bet is so high: the game has three jackpots, so it is natural that these are not given away for a few cents. Another detail is that the jackpots progress with the size of the bet, but they are not technically progressive in the understanding of the term \"progressive jackpot\".\n\nOn the other hand, the most expensive bet is not that expensive, so let's see what Ainsworth has done with this game. Raise the minimum bet, but don’t raise the maximum bet, so that a range of players can engage in a high-stakes bet on a game that is not high stakes at all, but on the other hand can provide a rather consistent payout.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nYggdrasil uses some of the most beloved images of Ancient Egypt with their Valley of the Gods slot. Every win will guarantee a respin to help you collect as many prizes as possible. Fight your way through the blockers to free the scarabs and a winning multiplier.\n\nBarcrest's Legend of the Pharaohs is the perfect game for anyone who loves classic slots with a twist. This game has multiple bonuses that can be triggered in addition to free spins. You could also try the Big Bet gamble feature to unlock more free spins with higher bonuses.\n        ",
