What makes Cleopatra, the free and no-registration slot, special besides its setting in ancient Egypt? Let's find out together in this review that will reveal new tricks to win the best winning combinations.\n\nCleopatra: The Queen of Egypt\n\nCleopatra is a traditional slot developed by iGaming giant IGT. It is one of the most popular Egyptian-themed slots of all time. It has 5 reels and 20 paylines, with an RTP that exceeds 92%. It can be played by betting from 0.10€ up to a maximum of 10.00€ per spin on both desktop and mobile devices. Released a few years ago, the graphics and animations may seem a bit dated, but they actually add a vintage touch to the game.\n\nThe Main Winning Symbols\n\nAs soon as you start the game, you will find yourself in front of an ancient Egyptian temple backdrop with reels adorned with precious Egyptian-style icons and classic symbols:\n\nCleopatra is the Wild symbol and replaces all icons except the Sphinx,\nThe Scarab is the most rewarding and fortunate symbol of this online slot. If 5 appear on a payline, you win 37.5 times your bet,\nCartouches (inscribed tablets),\nLotus flowers,\nA, K, Q, J, 10, and 9 Royals.\n\nImportant! When you get a winning combination that involves 1 or more Wilds, your payout is doubled. If you are super lucky and manage to get 5 Wilds on a payline, you will win 500 times your bet.\n\nBonuses and Other Special Features\n\nIn IGT's online slot, everything revolves around the figure of Cleopatra and her bonus, called Cleopatra Bonus, which can win you up to 180 free spins with a fantastic 3x multiplier. This feature is triggered when you get 3, 4, or 5 Sphinx Scatter symbols in any position on the reels, with a reward that will be 5, 20, or 100 times your bet + 15 free spins. The only case where this option cannot apply is if you get 5 Cleopatra Wilds on a payline. If you get 4 Scarabs and a Wild combination, you'll take home a double win from Cleopatra and a 3x multiplier that will give you a 6x multiplier.\n\nWhy Choose Cleopatra Online Slot?\n\nThe game convinced us, the graphics, although dated, are finely detailed, with well-designed icons. The background music is engaging and makes you feel like you're living a realistic adventure alongside the regal Cleopatra. You can also turn off the sound and focus on the game, both in demo mode and with real money, if you're looking for welcome bonuses and special promotions worthy of a king!\n            ",
