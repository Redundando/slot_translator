Le armi utilizzate per portare a termine la sua missione sono un arco e delle frecce con la punta a forma di cuore. Chiunque venga colpito dai suoi dardi cade preda di quello che si chiama mal d’amore. Comunque, Cupido non viene ricordato solo per il suo fascino e per l’indubbia capacità di far innamorare le persone. Egli, infatti, viene rappresentato spesso con la lira, lo strumento musicale caro ai greci.\nLa slot Cupid rende omaggio anche a sua madre Afrodite grazie all’utilizzo di tutti i principali cari alla dea, come l’anello, la coppa, la colomba e la rosa.\nLa grafica di Cupid è ben definita. La griglia di grandi dimensioni si staglia su un cielo azzurro e riempie interamente lo schermo. Nella parte inferiore si trovano le linee di pagamento attive e il valore della scommessa. Il tasto a destra ha una doppia funzione: menù prima di uno spin e funzione Gamble a seguito di una vincita. Doppia funzione anche per il pulsante di sinistra che serve sia per modificare l’importo della scommessa, sia per incassare le vincite. La musica arcade per nulla invasiva ci permette di giocare senza alcuna distrazione.\nCaratteristiche di Cupid\nLa Endorphina ha utilizzato una griglia classica con 5 rulli e 3 righe. Le linee di pagamento variano da minimo 1 a massimo 20. Va da sé che all’aumentare delle linee attive aumentano anche le probabilità di vincita. La scommessa varia da 0,01 € a un massimo di 200 €. Si possono selezionare tra 5 e 1.000 giri automatici e impostare limiti di tempo, di vincita singola o totale, ma anche di perdita.\nIl valore RTP pienamente nella media è del 96%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nIn Cupid ci sono alcuni simboli di basso valore, altri che invece sono molto remunerativi. I primi sono rappresentati dalle carte da gioco dal 9 all’asso. La coppa e l’anello ripagano la stessa cifra, a seguire troviamo la lira, la colomba, la rosa e infine Cupido. Oltre a essere un simbolo pagante, esso ricopre anche la funzione di Wild, per cui sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter e raddoppia le vincite. Lo Scatter è il cuore e oltre a offrire dei giri gratuiti, è un simbolo pagante. Anzi, è il simbolo che vale di più in assoluto. La rosa, il cuore e cupido pagano anche in combinazioni minime di due simboli, anziché tre come tutti gli altri.\nTre Scatter ci ricompensano con ben 20 Free Spins. Durante il gioco bonus potrebbero apparire dei cuori a metà di diversi colori. Quando la metà di sinistra si incontra con quella di destra, allora verranno applicati dei multipli. L’ampiezza del moltiplicatore dipende dal colore del simbolo. Ad esempio, con il cuore rosa chiaro il multiplo sarà x1, con il rosa scuro sarà 2x, con il verde x5, con il giallo 10x, con il viola x2o, con il verde diamante 50x, con il blu diamante x100, con quello multicolore x200 e infine con il rosso 500x!\nIn Cupid è presente anche la funzione Gamble. In questo caso potremmo provare a raddoppiare la vincita scegliendo una carta coperta. Se il valore è maggiore di quella del banco, allora raddoppieremo la somma e avremo una nuova opportunità (sino a un massimo di 5), nel caso invece la carta si riveli più bassa, allora perderemo tutto.\n",

His weapons for accomplishing his mission are a bow and arrows with heart-shaped tips. Whoever is hit by his arrows falls prey to what is called lovesickness. However, Cupid is not only remembered for his charm and his undeniable ability to make people fall in love. He is also often depicted with the lyre, the musical instrument dear to the Greeks.\n\nThe Cupid slot game also pays tribute to his mother Aphrodite by using all the main items dear to the goddess, such as the ring, the cup, the dove, and the rose.\n\nThe graphics of Cupid are well-defined. The large grid stands out against a blue sky and fills the entire screen. The active paylines and the value of the bet are located at the bottom.

The first are represented by the playing cards from 9 to Ace. The cup and the ring pay the same amount, followed by the lyre, the dove, the rose, and finally Cupid. In addition to being a paying symbol, Cupid also serves as a Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter and doubling winnings. The Scatter is the heart, and besides offering free spins, it is also a paying symbol. In fact, it is the symbol that is worth the most. The rose, heart, and Cupid also pay out on minimum combinations of two symbols, rather than three like all the others.\n\nThree Scatters reward us with 20 free spins.

His weapons for accomplishing his mission are a bow and arrows with heart-shaped tips. Whoever is hit by his arrows falls prey to what is called lovesickness. However, Cupid is not only remembered for his charm and his undeniable ability to make people fall in love. He is also often depicted with the lyre, the musical instrument dear to the Greeks.\n\nThe Cupid slot game also pays tribute to his mother Aphrodite by using all the main items dear to the goddess, such as the ring, the cup, the dove, and the rose.\n\nThe graphics of Cupid are well-defined. The large grid stands out against a blue sky and fills the entire screen. The active paylines and the value of the bet are located at the bottom. The button on the right has a dual function: menu before a spin and Gamble function after a win. The button on the left also has a dual function, serving both to modify the bet amount and to collect the winnings. The non-invasive arcade music allows us to play without any distractions.\n\nFeatures of Cupid\nEndorphina has used a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 20. As the number of active lines increases, so do the chances of winning. The bet ranges from €0.01 to a maximum of €200. You can select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins and set time, single or total win limits, as well as loss limits.\n\nThe RTP value is fully average at 96%.\n\nSymbols and features\nIn Cupid, there are some low-value symbols, and others that are very rewarding. The first are represented by the playing cards from 9 to Ace. The cup and the ring pay the same amount, followed by the lyre, the dove, the rose, and finally Cupid. In addition to being a paying symbol, Cupid also serves as a Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter and doubling winnings. The Scatter is the heart, and besides offering free spins, it is also a paying symbol. In fact, it is the symbol that is worth the most. The rose, heart, and Cupid also pay out on minimum combinations of two symbols, rather than three like all the others.\n\nThree Scatters reward us with 20 free spins. During the bonus game, half hearts of different colors may appear. When the left half meets the right half, then multipliers will be applied.

For example, with the light pink heart, the multiple will be x1, with the dark pink one it will be 2x, with green x5, with yellow 10x, with purple 20x, with diamond green 50x, with diamond blue x100, with multicolored x200 and finally with red 500x!\n\nCupid also features the Gamble function.

The paylines range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 20. As the number of active lines increases, so do the chances of winning. The bet ranges from €0.01 to a maximum of €200. You can select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins and set time, single or total win limits, as well as loss limits.\n\nThe RTP value is fully average at 96%.\n\nSymbols and features\nIn Cupid, there are some low-value symbols, and others that are very rewarding. The first are represented by the playing cards from 9 to Ace. The cup and the ring pay the same amount, followed by the lyre, the dove, the rose, and finally Cupid. In addition to being a paying symbol, Cupid also serves as a Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter and doubling winnings. The Scatter is the heart, and besides offering free spins, it is also a paying symbol. In fact, it is the symbol that is worth the most. The rose, heart, and Cupid also pay out on minimum combinations of two symbols, rather than three like all the others.\n\nThree Scatters reward us with 20 free spins. During the bonus game, half hearts of different colors may appear. When the left half meets the right half, then multipliers will be applied. The magnitude of the multiplier depends on the color of the symbol. For example, with the light pink heart, the multiple will be x1, with the dark pink one it will be 2x, with green x5, with yellow 10x, with purple 20x, with diamond green 50x, with diamond blue x100, with multicolored x200 and finally with red 500x!\n\nCupid also features the Gamble function. In this case, we can try to double our winnings by choosing a hidden card. If the value is higher than that of the bank, then we will double the amount and have a new opportunity (up to a maximum of 5), but if the card turns out to be lower, then we will lose everything.\n            ",

The graphics are well-defined, and the large grid stands out against a blue sky and fills the entire screen. The active paylines and the value of the bet are located at the bottom, with the button on the right having a dual function: menu before a spin and Gamble function after a win. The non-invasive arcade music allows us to play without any distractions.\n\nSlot Game Layout and Features\n\nCupid utilizes a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 20. The bet ranges from €0.01 to a maximum of €200. Players can select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins and set time, single or total win limits, as well as loss limits. The RTP value is fully average at 96%.\n\nSymbols and Their Values\n\nCupid features low-value symbols, which are represented by the playing cards from 9 to Ace. The cup and the ring pay the same amount, followed by the lyre, the dove, the rose, and finally Cupid. In addition to being a paying symbol, Cupid also serves as a Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter and doubling winnings. The Scatter is the heart, and besides offering free spins, it is also a paying symbol. The rose, heart, and Cupid also pay out on minimum combinations of two symbols, rather than three like all the others.\n\nWilds and Scatters\n\nCupid is the Wild symbol in the game, and it replaces all symbols except the Scatter and doubles winnings. The Scatter is represented by the heart, and it is the symbol that pays out the most. Three Scatters reward players with 20 free spins. During the bonus game, half hearts of different colors may appear. When the left half meets the right half, then multipliers will be applied. The magnitude of the multiplier depends on the color of the symbol.\n\nFree Spins and Multipliers\n\nIn Cupid, three Scatters reward players with 20 free spins. During the bonus game, half hearts of different colors appear. When the left half meets the right half, multipliers will be applied. The magnitude of the multiplier depends on the color of the symbol, ranging from x1 to x500. Cupid also features the Gamble function, where players can try to double their winnings by choosing a hidden card. If the value is higher than that of the bank, the player doubles the amount and has a new opportunity (up to a maximum of 5), but if the card turns out to be lower, the player loses everything.\n\n        \n            ",

His weapons for accomplishing his mission are a bow and arrows with heart-shaped tips. Whoever is hit by his arrows falls prey to what is called lovesickness. However, Cupid is not only remembered for his charm and his undeniable ability to make people fall in love. He is also often depicted with the lyre, the musical instrument dear to the Greeks.\n\nThe Cupid slot game also pays tribute to his mother Aphrodite by using all the main items dear to the goddess, such as the ring, the cup, the dove, and the rose.\n\nThe graphics of Cupid are well-defined. The large grid stands out against a blue sky and fills the entire screen. The active paylines and the value of the bet are located at the bottom. The button on the right has a dual function: menu before a spin and Gamble function after a win. The button on the left also has a dual function, serving both to modify the bet amount and to collect the winnings. The non-invasive arcade music allows us to play without any distractions.\n\nFeatures of Cupid\nEndorphina has used a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 20. As the number of active lines increases, so do the chances of winning. The bet ranges from €0.01 to a maximum of €200. You can select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins and set time, single or total win limits, as well as loss limits.\n\nThe RTP value is fully average at 96%.\n\nSymbols and features\nIn Cupid, there are some low-value symbols, and others that are very rewarding. The first are represented by the playing cards from 9 to Ace. The cup and the ring pay the same amount, followed by the lyre, the dove, the rose, and finally Cupid. In addition to being a paying symbol, Cupid also serves as a Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter and doubling winnings. The Scatter is the heart, and besides offering free spins, it is also a paying symbol. In fact, it is the symbol that is worth the most. The rose, heart, and Cupid also pay out on minimum combinations of two symbols, rather than three like all the others.\n\nThree Scatters reward us with 20 free spins. During the bonus game, half hearts of different colors may appear. When the left half meets the right half, then multipliers will be applied. The magnitude of the multiplier depends on the color of the symbol. For example, with the light pink heart, the multiple will be x1, with the dark pink one it will be 2x, with green x5, with yellow 10x, with purple 20x, with diamond green 50x, with diamond blue x100, with multicolored x200 and finally with red 500x!\n\nCupid also features the Gamble function. In this case, we can try to double our winnings by choosing a hidden card. If the value is higher than that of the bank, then we will double the amount and have a new opportunity (up to a maximum of 5), but if the card turns out to be lower, then we will lose everything.\n            ",

His weapons for accomplishing his mission are a bow and arrows with heart-shaped tips. Whoever is hit by his arrows falls prey to what is called lovesickness. However, Cupid is not only remembered for his charm and his undeniable ability to make people fall in love. He is also often depicted with the lyre, the musical instrument dear to the Greeks.\n\nThe Cupid slot game also pays tribute to his mother Aphrodite by using all the main items dear to the goddess, such as the ring, the cup, the dove, and the rose.\n\nThe graphics of Cupid are well-defined. The large grid stands out against a blue sky and fills the entire screen. The active paylines and the value of the bet are located at the bottom. The button on the right has a dual function: menu before a spin and Gamble function after a win. The button on the left also has a dual function, serving both to modify the bet amount and to collect the winnings. The non-invasive arcade music allows us to play without any distractions.\n\nFeatures of Cupid\nEndorphina has used a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 20. As the number of active lines increases, so do the chances of winning. The bet ranges from €0.01 to a maximum of €200. You can select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins and set time, single or total win limits, as well as loss limits.\n\nThe RTP value is fully average at 96%.\n\nSymbols and features\nIn Cupid, there are some low-value symbols, and others that are very rewarding. The first are represented by the playing cards from 9 to Ace. The cup and the ring pay the same amount, followed by the lyre, the dove, the rose, and finally Cupid. In addition to being a paying symbol, Cupid also serves as a Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter and doubling winnings. The Scatter is the heart, and besides offering free spins, it is also a paying symbol. In fact, it is the symbol that is worth the most. The rose, heart, and Cupid also pay out on minimum combinations of two symbols, rather than three like all the others.\n\nThree Scatters reward us with 20 free spins. During the bonus game, half hearts of different colors may appear. When the left half meets the right half, then multipliers will be applied. The magnitude of the multiplier depends on the color of the symbol. For example, with the light pink heart, the multiple will be x1, with the dark pink one it will be 2x, with green x5, with yellow 10x, with purple 20x, with diamond green 50x, with diamond blue x100, with multicolored x200 and finally with red 500x!\n\nCupid also features the Gamble function. In this case, we can try to double our winnings by choosing a hidden card. If the value is higher than that of the bank, then we will double the amount and have a new opportunity (up to a maximum of 5), but if the card turns out to be lower, then we will lose everything.\n            ",
