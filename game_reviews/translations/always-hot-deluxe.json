This particular game manages to take everything people loved about classic slot machines of the past and put it into something you'll love, even if you're not a fan of old-school slot machines.\n\nA retro graphics style\nThe hot red fruits are back in Novomatic's sequel to the popular retro slot machine, Always Hot. The fruits are bigger and hotter than ever in Always Hot Deluxe. With increased heat and fun, this slot game offers the opportunity to win up to 60,000 coins in the non-progressive jackpot located below the reels. Unlike its predecessor, Always Hot Deluxe offers paired fruits – this means better potential for winning and bigger payouts. With 3 reels and 5 paylines, you can spin from 0.40 to 0.40 while hunting for the fruits that lead to the jackpot. \n\nFair play to Novomatic, they have created a portfolio of classic slot machines that offer much more than traditional gameplay. Take, for example, the 5 Line Mystery slot machine, which features a classic fruit machine with mystery bonuses, wilds, and a gambling feature. Each spin has the potential to unlock thousands of coins. The Always Hot Deluxe slot machine is equally exciting, despite the lack of features – but the jackpot more than makes up for it.\n\nThe theme of this slot machine is as you'd imagine – thanks to its name. The reels are solid white and embedded in a flaming design that resembles flickering flames. Both sides of the reels feature five orange buttons – these highlight the 5 paylines present in this game. There's a control panel at the bottom of the screen that offers a message bar with encouraging messages while you play, the current credit, and the last win. Below it are the paytable, autoplay feature, betting regulator, gambling feature, and start buttons.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThere's only one feature present in the Always Hot Deluxe slot machine, and it's the Gamble feature. While playing the slot, you have the opportunity to activate this feature by spinning in any winning combination on your reels. You have a time limit to decide whether to gamble or not – take too long, and the slot machine will credit your initial winnings to your account.\n\nIf you decide to gamble, you'll be taken to a new screen where trembling playing cards will be on the left and right of your screen. The card history that has been produced will appear at the top of the screen, allowing you to try and guess the color of the next card. Guess correctly to double your initial win. You can keep going for as long as you win, but guess incorrectly at any time, and you'll lose everything in this gambling feature.\n\nA game with the word \"hot\" in the name is certainly full of hot rewards, and this is no exception. Always Hot Deluxe offers up to 4,000 coins for aligning cherries, lemons, oranges, and plums on the reels. If you want to squeeze a little more, then take bells or grapes for up to 8,000 coins. Things can go even better than that, which will be music to the ears of avid slot players. Melons can pay up to 10,000 coins if you're lucky. For a 20,000-coin prize, you need stars, while lucky sevens give you a grand prize of up to 30,000 coins.\n\nOnline slot players will find something fun here regardless of their budget or experience. This 5-line game allows you to place a bet that suits your playing style and budget. Your bet is between 5 and 500 coins, with coin values ranging from 0.5 to 2.0. So the minimum bet for a full spin is 2.5 coins. There are many different bets you can make up to the maximum bet of 500 coins per spin.\n\nThere are 3 reels and 5 fixed paylines for Always Hot Deluxe. The minimum bets start from just 0.40 per spin, while the maximum bets can be increased up to 100.00 per spin – perfect for high-level players.\n\nSpin a trio of double red 7s and unlock the non-progressive jackpot of 60,000 coins – this is awarded to those who place the maximum bet. The second-highest paying symbol on the reels is the double gold stars, which offer a payout of 40,000 coins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nBefore, we mentioned another famous slot machine produced by Novomatic, so we recommend it as an alternative.

This particular game takes everything people loved about classic slot machines of the past and puts it into something you will enjoy, even if you are not a fan of old-school slot machines.\n\nRetro graphics\nThe hot red fruits are back in Novomatic's second instalment. Always Hot Deluxe is a follow-up to the popular retro slot machine Always Hot, and the fruits are bigger and hotter than ever. With increasing heat and excitement, this slot game offers the chance to win up to 60,000 coins in the non-progressive jackpot located below the reels. Unlike its predecessor, Always Hot Deluxe offers paired fruits - this means better winning potential and better wins. With 3 reels and 5 paylines, you can spin from 0.40 to 0.40 while hunting for the fruits that bring the jackpot. \n\nFair play to Novomatic, they have created a portfolio of classic slot machines that offer much more than traditional gameplay. Take, for example, the 5 Line Mystery slot machine, which offers a classic fruit machine with a mystery bonus game, wilds and a gambling feature. Each spin has the potential to unlock thousands of coins. The Always Hot Deluxe slot machine is equally exciting, despite the lack of features - but the jackpot more than makes up for it.\n\nThe theme of this slot machine is as you imagine - thanks to its name. The reels are a solid white and are set on a flaming design that evokes flickering flames. Both sides of the reels are five orange buttons - these highlight the 5 paylines present in this game. There is a control panel at the bottom of the screen that offers a message bar with encouraging messages while playing, your current credit, and your last win. Below it are the paytable, autoplay feature, bet regulator, gambling feature, and play buttons.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nThere is only one feature present with the Always Hot Deluxe slot machine, and it is the Gamble feature. While playing the slot machine, you have the chance to activate this feature by spinning any winning combination on your reels. You have a limited time to decide whether to gamble or not - take too long, and the slot machine will credit the initial winnings to your account.\n\nIf you decide to gamble, you will be taken to a new screen where trembling playing cards are on the left and right of your screen. At the top of the screen will be the history of the cards that have been dealt, allowing you to guess what colour the next card will be. Guess correctly to double your initial win. You can continue as long as you keep winning, but guess wrong at any time, and you'll lose everything in this gambling game.\n\nA game with the word \"hot\" in the name is certainly full of hot prizes, and this is no exception. Always Hot Deluxe offers up to 4,000 coins for aligning cherries, lemons, oranges, and plums on the reels. If you want to squeeze a bit more, then take bells or grapes for up to 8,000 coins. Things can go even better than that, which will be music to the ears of avid slot players. Melons can pay up to 10,000 coins if you're lucky. For a prize of 20,000 coins, you need stars, while lucky sevens give you a grand prize of up to 30,000 coins.\n\nOnline slot players will find something fun here, regardless of their budget or experience. This 5-line game allows you to make a bet that suits your play style and budget. Your bet ranges from 5 to 500 coins, with coin values ranging from 0.5 to 2.0. So the minimum bet for a full spin is 2.5 coins. There are many different bets you can make up to a maximum bet of 500 coins per spin.\n\nThere are 3 reels and 5 fixed paylines for Always Hot Deluxe. Minimum bets start at just 0.40 per spin, while maximum bets can be increased up to 100.00 per spin - perfect for high-level players.\n\nSpin a trio of red double 7s and unlock the non-progressive jackpot of 60,000 coins - this is awarded to those who play the maximum bet. The second highest paying symbol on the reels is the double gold stars, which offers a payout of 40,000 coins.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nWe previously mentioned another famous slot machine produced by Novomatic, so we recommend it as an alternative. If you're looking for a simple and classic slot with a hint of modern functionality, Sizzling Hot Deluxe is a low volatility slot with small regular win"

This particular game takes everything people loved about classic slot machines of the past and puts it into something you will enjoy, even if you are not a fan of old-school slot machines.\n\nRetro graphics\nThe hot red fruits are back in Novomatic's second instalment. Always Hot Deluxe is a follow-up to the popular retro slot machine Always Hot, and the fruits are bigger and hotter than ever. With increasing heat and excitement, this slot game offers the chance to win up to 60,000 coins in the non-progressive jackpot located below the reels. Unlike its predecessor, Always Hot Deluxe offers paired fruits - this means better winning potential and better wins. With 3 reels and 5 paylines, you can spin from 0.40 to 0.40 while hunting for the fruits that bring the jackpot. \n\nFair play to Novomatic, they have created a portfolio of classic slot machines that offer much more than traditional gameplay. Take, for example, the 5 Line Mystery slot machine, which offers a classic fruit machine with a mystery bonus game, wilds and a gambling feature. Each spin has the potential to unlock thousands of coins. The Always Hot Deluxe slot machine is equally exciting, despite the lack of features - but the jackpot more than makes up for it.\n\nThe theme of this slot machine is as you imagine - thanks to its name. The reels are a solid white and are set on a flaming design that evokes flickering flames. Both sides of the reels are five orange buttons - these highlight the 5 paylines present in this game. There is a control panel at the bottom of the screen that offers a message bar with encouraging messages while playing, your current credit, and your last win. Below it are the paytable, autoplay feature, bet regulator, gambling feature, and play buttons.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nThere is only one feature present with the Always Hot Deluxe slot machine, and it is the Gamble feature. While playing the slot machine, you have the chance to activate this feature by spinning any winning combination on your reels. You have a limited time to decide whether to gamble or not - take too long, and the slot machine will credit the initial winnings to your account.\n\nIf you decide to gamble, you will be taken to a new screen where trembling playing cards are on the left and right of your screen. At the top of the screen will be the history of the cards that have been dealt, allowing you to guess what colour the next card will be. Guess correctly to double your initial win. You can continue as long as you keep winning, but guess wrong at any time, and you'll lose everything in this gambling game.\n\nA game with the word \"hot\" in the name is certainly full of hot prizes, and this is no exception. Always Hot Deluxe offers up to 4,000 coins for aligning cherries, lemons, oranges, and plums on the reels. If you want to squeeze a bit more, then take bells or grapes for up to 8,000 coins. Things can go even better than that, which will be music to the ears of avid slot players. Melons can pay up to 10,000 coins if you're lucky. For a prize of 20,000 coins, you need stars, while lucky sevens give you a grand prize of up to 30,000 coins.\n\nOnline slot players will find something fun here, regardless of their budget or experience. This 5-line game allows you to make a bet that suits your play style and budget. Your bet ranges from 5 to 500 coins, with coin values ranging from 0.5 to 2.0. So the minimum bet for a full spin is 2.5 coins. There are many different bets you can make up to a maximum bet of 500 coins per spin.\n\nThere are 3 reels and 5 fixed paylines for Always Hot Deluxe. Minimum bets start at just 0.40 per spin, while maximum bets can be increased up to 100.00 per spin - perfect for high-level players.\n\nSpin a trio of red double 7s and unlock the non-progressive jackpot of 60,000 coins - this is awarded to those who play the maximum bet. The second highest paying symbol on the reels is the double gold stars, which offers a payout of 40,000 coins.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nWe previously mentioned another famous slot machine produced by Novomatic, so we recommend it as an alternative. If you're looking for a simple and classic slot with a hint of modern functionality, Sizzling Hot Deluxe is a low volatility slot with small regular win\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and Rules\n\nAlways Hot Deluxe is a classic slot machine with 3 reels and 5 paylines. The game offers paired fruits, increasing winning potential, and wins. The slot machine also offers a non-progressive jackpot of up to 60,000 coins, which is awarded to those who play the maximum bet. The control panel located at the bottom of the screen offers players a message bar, the current credit, and the last win. Players can also access the paytable, autoplay feature, bet regulator, gambling feature, and play buttons.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nAlways Hot Deluxe offers players the chance to win up to 60,000 coins in the non-progressive jackpot located below the reels. The game has a relatively simple symbol system that rewards players for aligning cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, bells, grapes, melons, stars, and lucky sevens on the reels. Spin a trio of red double 7s for the highest payout. The game also includes a gambling feature where players can double their initial win by correctly guessing the colour of the next card.\n\nGamble Feature\n\nThe only feature in Always Hot Deluxe is the Gamble feature. After spinning a winning combination on the reels, players can activate the feature, which takes them to a new screen where they can gamble to double their initial win. Players are shown a history of the cards that have been dealt and must guess the colour of the next card to continue winning. Players can continue as long as they keep winning, but a wrong guess will result in a loss of all winnings.\n\nDesign and Theme\n\nThe theme of Always Hot Deluxe is retro and reminiscent of classic slot machines. The reels are set on a flaming design, and both sides of the reels are five orange buttons. The control panel at the bottom of the screen offers players access to various features and buttons, including the message bar, current credit, and last win. The slot machine uses simple graphics, with vibrant hot red fruits as its main symbols.\n\nBetting Options\n\nAlways Hot Deluxe offers players a variety of betting options. The minimum bet is 0.40 per spin, while the maximum bet can be increased up to 500.00 per spin. The coin value ranges from 0.5 to 2.0, and players can bet anywhere from 5 to 500 coins per spin. The game has a low to medium volatility, with a reasonably high maximum payout of 60,000 coins.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nAlways Hot Deluxe will appeal to fans of classic slot machines, as well as those who enjoy simple and straightforward gameplay. The game is also suitable for players who like to bet low or high stakes. The gambling feature adds an element of risk to the game, making it more entertaining for players who enjoy taking chances.\n\nComparison with Similar Games\n\nAlways Hot Deluxe is similar to other classic slot machines developed by Novomatic, such as Sizzling Hot Deluxe. However, Always Hot Deluxe offers a non-progressive jackpot of up to 60,000 coins, which is higher than the maximum payout offered by Sizzling Hot Deluxe. Always Hot Deluxe also offers a pair of fruits for increased winning potential and better wins. Sizzling Hot Deluxe, on the other hand, has a low volatility, which makes it more suitable for players who want small regular wins.\n\n        \n            ",

It has retro graphics and is easy to play with a simple control panel at the bottom of the screen. The game only has one feature - the gambling feature - but the potential for a non-progressive jackpot of 60,000 coins more than makes up for it.\n\nWinning potential\n\nAlways Hot Deluxe has a maximum jackpot of 60,000 coins and offers good winning potential with paired fruits and a variety of symbols on the reels. Cherries, lemons, oranges and plums pay up to 4,000 coins, while bells or grapes pay up to 8,000 coins. Melons can pay up to 10,000 coins and stars up to 20,000 coins, while lucky sevens give a grand prize of up to 30,000 coins. The second highest paying symbol on the reels is the double gold stars, which offers a payout of 40,000 coins.\n\nGambling feature\n\nThe only feature present in the Always Hot Deluxe slot machine is the gambling feature. When you spin any winning combination, you have the option to activate this feature. Take too long to decide, and the slot machine will credit the initial winnings to your account. If you decide to gamble, you will be taken to a new screen where trembling playing cards are on the left and right of your screen. The aim is to guess the colour of the next card and double your initial win. You can continue as long as you keep winning, but if you guess wrong at any time, you'll lose everything.\n\nDesign and theme\n\nAlways Hot Deluxe has a bold and colourful design that perfectly suits its retro theme. The reels are set on a flaming design, and highlights the 5 paylines with five orange buttons. There is a control panel at the bottom of the screen with a message bar, your current credits, and your last win. The game is easy to navigate with clear graphics and a simple design.\n\nBetting options\n\nAlways Hot Deluxe offers a range of betting options, making it suitable for players of all levels and budgets. The game has 3 reels and 5 fixed paylines, with minimum bets starting at just 0.40 per spin and maximum bets up to 100.00 per spin, perfect for high-level players. Your bet ranges from 5 to 500 coins, with coin values ranging from 0.5 to 2.0. The minimum bet for a full spin is 2.5 coins.\n\nSimilar Novomatic slots\n\nIf you enjoy classic slot machines, Novomatic offers a range of similar games to Always Hot Deluxe. These include Sizzling Hot Deluxe, which has a low volatility and small regular wins, and 5 Line Mystery, which offers a classic fruit machine with a mystery bonus game, wilds and a gambling feature.\n\nSuitable for all players\n\nAlways Hot Deluxe is suitable for players of all levels and budgets. With a range of betting options, you can choose a wager that suits your play style and budget. The game is easy to navigate, has simple controls, and is perfect for those who want a retro feel with the potential for big wins.\n\n        \n            ",

This particular game takes everything people loved about classic slot machines of the past and puts it into something you will enjoy, even if you are not a fan of old-school slot machines.\n\nRetro graphics\nThe hot red fruits are back in Novomatic's second instalment. Always Hot Deluxe is a follow-up to the popular retro slot machine Always Hot, and the fruits are bigger and hotter than ever. With increasing heat and excitement, this slot game offers the chance to win up to 60,000 coins in the non-progressive jackpot located below the reels. Unlike its predecessor, Always Hot Deluxe offers paired fruits - this means better winning potential and better wins. With 3 reels and 5 paylines, you can spin from 0.40 to 0.40 while hunting for the fruits that bring the jackpot. \n\nFair play to Novomatic, they have created a portfolio of classic slot machines that offer much more than traditional gameplay. Take, for example, the 5 Line Mystery slot machine, which offers a classic fruit machine with a mystery bonus game, wilds and a gambling feature. Each spin has the potential to unlock thousands of coins. The Always Hot Deluxe slot machine is equally exciting, despite the lack of features - but the jackpot more than makes up for it.\n\nThe theme of this slot machine is as you imagine - thanks to its name. The reels are a solid white and are set on a flaming design that evokes flickering flames. Both sides of the reels are five orange buttons - these highlight the 5 paylines present in this game. There is a control panel at the bottom of the screen that offers a message bar with encouraging messages while playing, your current credit, and your last win. Below it are the paytable, autoplay feature, bet regulator, gambling feature, and play buttons.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nThere is only one feature present with the Always Hot Deluxe slot machine, and it is the Gamble feature. While playing the slot machine, you have the chance to activate this feature by spinning any winning combination on your reels. You have a limited time to decide whether to gamble or not - take too long, and the slot machine will credit the initial winnings to your account.\n\nIf you decide to gamble, you will be taken to a new screen where trembling playing cards are on the left and right of your screen. At the top of the screen will be the history of the cards that have been dealt, allowing you to guess what colour the next card will be. Guess correctly to double your initial win. You can continue as long as you keep winning, but guess wrong at any time, and you'll lose everything in this gambling game.\n\nA game with the word \"hot\" in the name is certainly full of hot prizes, and this is no exception. Always Hot Deluxe offers up to 4,000 coins for aligning cherries, lemons, oranges, and plums on the reels. If you want to squeeze a bit more, then take bells or grapes for up to 8,000 coins. Things can go even better than that, which will be music to the ears of avid slot players. Melons can pay up to 10,000 coins if you're lucky. For a prize of 20,000 coins, you need stars, while lucky sevens give you a grand prize of up to 30,000 coins.\n\nOnline slot players will find something fun here, regardless of their budget or experience. This 5-line game allows you to make a bet that suits your play style and budget. Your bet ranges from 5 to 500 coins, with coin values ranging from 0.5 to 2.0. So the minimum bet for a full spin is 2.5 coins. There are many different bets you can make up to a maximum bet of 500 coins per spin.\n\nThere are 3 reels and 5 fixed paylines for Always Hot Deluxe. Minimum bets start at just 0.40 per spin, while maximum bets can be increased up to 100.00 per spin - perfect for high-level players.\n\nSpin a trio of red double 7s and unlock the non-progressive jackpot of 60,000 coins - this is awarded to those who play the maximum bet. The second highest paying symbol on the reels is the double gold stars, which offers a payout of 40,000 coins.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nWe previously mentioned another famous slot machine produced by Novomatic, so we recommend it as an alternative. If you're looking for a simple and classic slot with a hint of modern functionality, Sizzling Hot Deluxe is a low volatility slot with small regular win\n            ",

This particular game takes everything people loved about classic slot machines of the past and puts it into something you will enjoy, even if you are not a fan of old-school slot machines.\n\nRetro graphics\nThe hot red fruits are back in Novomatic's second instalment. Always Hot Deluxe is a follow-up to the popular retro slot machine Always Hot, and the fruits are bigger and hotter than ever. With increasing heat and excitement, this slot game offers the chance to win up to 60,000 coins in the non-progressive jackpot located below the reels. Unlike its predecessor, Always Hot Deluxe offers paired fruits - this means better winning potential and better wins. With 3 reels and 5 paylines, you can spin from 0.40 to 0.40 while hunting for the fruits that bring the jackpot. \n\nFair play to Novomatic, they have created a portfolio of classic slot machines that offer much more than traditional gameplay. Take, for example, the 5 Line Mystery slot machine, which offers a classic fruit machine with a mystery bonus game, wilds and a gambling feature. Each spin has the potential to unlock thousands of coins. The Always Hot Deluxe slot machine is equally exciting, despite the lack of features - but the jackpot more than makes up for it.\n\nThe theme of this slot machine is as you imagine - thanks to its name. The reels are a solid white and are set on a flaming design that evokes flickering flames. Both sides of the reels are five orange buttons - these highlight the 5 paylines present in this game. There is a control panel at the bottom of the screen that offers a message bar with encouraging messages while playing, your current credit, and your last win. Below it are the paytable, autoplay feature, bet regulator, gambling feature, and play buttons.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nThere is only one feature present with the Always Hot Deluxe slot machine, and it is the Gamble feature. While playing the slot machine, you have the chance to activate this feature by spinning any winning combination on your reels. You have a limited time to decide whether to gamble or not - take too long, and the slot machine will credit the initial winnings to your account.\n\nIf you decide to gamble, you will be taken to a new screen where trembling playing cards are on the left and right of your screen. At the top of the screen will be the history of the cards that have been dealt, allowing you to guess what colour the next card will be. Guess correctly to double your initial win. You can continue as long as you keep winning, but guess wrong at any time, and you'll lose everything in this gambling game.\n\nA game with the word \"hot\" in the name is certainly full of hot prizes, and this is no exception. Always Hot Deluxe offers up to 4,000 coins for aligning cherries, lemons, oranges, and plums on the reels. If you want to squeeze a bit more, then take bells or grapes for up to 8,000 coins. Things can go even better than that, which will be music to the ears of avid slot players. Melons can pay up to 10,000 coins if you're lucky. For a prize of 20,000 coins, you need stars, while lucky sevens give you a grand prize of up to 30,000 coins.\n\nOnline slot players will find something fun here, regardless of their budget or experience. This 5-line game allows you to make a bet that suits your play style and budget. Your bet ranges from 5 to 500 coins, with coin values ranging from 0.5 to 2.0.
