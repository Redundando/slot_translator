In fact, there are dozens of games with an Ancient Egyptian theme, and the leading providers constantly offer new ones or improved versions of existing games. We have only seen such success with Fruit Machines, the classic fruit-themed games that still have the power to attract both old and new players over the years.\nRegarding Ancient Egypt, the reasons for such success may lie in the irresistible charm of Egyptian culture with its splendor and mysteries, as well as in the possibility given by the theme itself to indulge in spectacular graphics and to use ancient Egyptian symbols as game icons.\nIn addition to the most famous Egyptian themed slot machines, such as the lucky saga of Book of Ra, Book of Ra Deluxe, and Book of Ra 6, we also recommend some lesser-known ones that are worth trying out.\nThese include:\n\nTreasure of Horus\nJohn Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen\nCleopatra Plus\nPyramid Escape\nSecret of Nefertiti\nPyramid Quest for immortality\n\n...and many more!\nYou can try them all, even in play-for-fun mode without betting real money, on the leading online casinos!\nEgyptian Fortune: key features\nWe have already seen the theme, and in terms of graphics, as mentioned above, the world of Ancient Egypt is highly suitable for rich elaboration: Egyptian Fortune is no exception in this respect!\nThe gameplay of this Pragmatic slot is fairly straightforward, with 5 reels, 20 paylines, and a total betting range from 0.20 to 100 € per spin.\nYou can also play Egyptian Fortunes in Autoplay mode, selecting the number of automatic spins, from 10 to 100, and the win and loss limits.\nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters\nThe main screen opens with the enigmatic Sphinx, while on the reels, in addition to the playing cards from 10 to Ace, we find ancient golden amulets, hieroglyphs, deities with half-animal and half-human features, pyramids, and scarabs.\nThe Wild symbol is represented by a golden amulet adorned with precious stones, which acts as a wildcard and can replace all other symbols, except the Scatter, in completing a winning combination; the Wild is also the symbol that pays the most overall.\nThe Scatter, on the other hand, is a Pyramid and can only appear on odd reels: when three of them appear, you will gain access to the Free Spins Bonus, which not only gives you free spins but also generous multipliers.\n        ",
