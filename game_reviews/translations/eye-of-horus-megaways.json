This game is a revamped and modernized version of the historic Eye of Horus slot, also from Blueprint. Wins are obtained when you have a combination of at least three identical symbols on adjacent reels starting from the left. The Ancient Egypt theme, widely used in the world of slot machines, accompanies a quite elaborate gameplay, made unique by the recent Megaways game system. Regarding the graphics, Blueprint made the wise decision to keep the style and images of the previous version, updating them and making them more modern, but focusing primarily on the new slot's gameplay.\n\nRegular and special symbols of Eye of Horus Megaways\nAs in any respectable slot, you can preview the value of all symbols by consulting the paytable. Among the non-themed regular symbols, we find the numbers and letters referring to playing cards from J to Ace, which determine a maximum win equal to 0.4 times the initial bet. Besides, there are thematic symbols related to Ancient Egypt culture, such as the Ankh cross, the blue sacred scarab, the falcon, the god Anubis with half-human and half-canine features, and of course, the Eye of Horus, which is also the game's wild and as such, can replace all other symbols to complete winning combinations. Regarding the Scatter, it's represented by an ancient golden temple and allows access to the special features of Eye of Horus Megaways.\n\nSpecial features of Eye of Horus Megaways\nInstead of special features, we should talk about a single extra feature, namely the free spins. If three to six Scatters (the golden temple) appear on the reels, 12 free spins are automatically activated, and additional ones (up to five) are given every time the Wild symbol appears during the free spins. Moreover, the Scatter symbol not only gives free spins but also fantastic multipliers: depending on the number of times it appears on the reels, it determines wins of up to 100 times the initial bet. Finally, regarding the Wild (the Eye of Horus), we add that during the free spins, it not only increases them but also acts as an expandable symbol on all six reels, determining the most substantial wins, up to the jackpot of 10,000 times the bet!",

This game is a revisited and modernized version of the historic slot Eye of Horus, also from Blueprint. Wins are obtained when there is a combination of at least three identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right.

As for the graphic department, Blueprint has wisely decided to maintain the style and images of the previous version, updating them, and making them more modern but focusing mainly on the new slot's gameplay mode.\n\nRegular and Special Symbols of Eye of Horus Megaways\nAs in every respectable slot, it is also possible to know the value of all symbols in advance by consulting the paytable in Eye of Horus Megaways. Among the non-themed regular symbols, we find the numbers and letters referring to playing cards from J to Ace (the so-called royal symbols), which determine a maximum win equal to 0.4 times the initial bet. Next to these are the thematic symbols related to the culture of Ancient Egypt, including the Ankh cross, the sacred blue scarab, the falcon, the god Anubi with features halfway between human and canine, and of course, the Eye of Horus, which is also the game's Wild and can substitute for all other symbols to complete winning combinations. As for the Scatter, this is represented by an ancient golden temple and allows access to the special features of Eye of Horus Megaways.\n\nSpecial Features of Eye of Horus Megaways\nActually, more than special features, we should talk about a single extra feature, namely the free spins. If three to six Scatters (the golden temple) appear on the reels, 12 free spins are automatically activated, and more (up to five) will be awarded each time the Wild symbol appears during the free spins. Moreover, the Scatter symbol not only gives free spins but also delicious multipliers: depending on how many times it appears on the reels, it determines winnings up to one hundred times the initial bet. Finally, regarding the Wild (the Eye of Horus), we add that during free spins, in addition to increasing the number of free spins, it also behaves as an expandable symbol on all six reels, determining the most substantial wins, up to a jackpot of 10,000 times the bet!\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and Features\n\nEye of Horus Megaways is a modernized version of the historic slot Eye of Horus, featuring six reels, five lines, and 15,625 different ways to win. Wins are obtained with a combination of at least three identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right. The game has a fairly articulated gameplay, made special by the recent Megaways gaming system.\n\nTheme and Design\n\nThe slot's theme is Ancient Egypt, a commonly used theme in the world of slot machines. Blueprint has maintained the style and images of the previous version, updating them, and making them more modern. The graphic department's focus is mainly on the new slot's gameplay mode.\n\nWinning Potential and Jackpots\n\nPlayers can win up to 10,000 times the bet with Eye of Horus Megaways. The Wild symbol (the Eye of Horus) during free spins behaves as an expandable symbol on all six reels, determining the most substantial wins. The Scatter symbol gives free spins and also multipliers for winnings up to one hundred times the initial bet.\n\nSymbols and Paytable\n\nPlayers can check the paytable for the value of all symbols in advance. Non-themed regular symbols include playing card symbols from J to Ace, which determine a maximum win equal to 0.4 times the initial bet. Thematic symbols related to the culture of Ancient Egypt include the Ankh cross, the sacred blue scarab, the falcon, the god Anubi, and of course, the Eye of Horus, which is also the game's Wild and can substitute for all other symbols to complete winning combinations.\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nThe game's only extra feature is the free spins. Players can activate 12 free spins if three to six Scatters (the golden temple) appear on the reels, and more (up to five) will be awarded each time the Wild symbol appears during the free spins. The Wild symbol behaves as an expandable symbol on all six reels, determining the most substantial wins, up to a jackpot of 10,000 times the bet!\n\n        \n            ",

Wins are achieved by landing a combination of at least three identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nBlueprint Gaming has updated and modernized the graphics and design of Eye of Horus Megaways while maintaining the style and images of the previous version. The game's Ancient Egyptian theme is well-executed and features a Megaways gaming system, making the gameplay mode unique.\n\nTheme and Setting\n\nThe theme of Eye of Horus Megaways is Ancient Egypt, which is a common theme in the world of slot machines. However, Blueprint Gaming has chosen to incorporate the Megaways gaming system to make the game more exciting and complex. The game introduces several non-themed regular symbols, playing cards from J to Ace, as well as thematic symbols such as the Ankh cross, the sacred blue scarab, the falcon, the god Anubi, and the Eye of Horus symbol.\n\nSpecial Features and Bonuses\n\nThe only extra feature in Eye of Horus Megaways is the free spins. When a player lands three to six Scatters (the golden temple) on the reels, they will gain 12 free spins. Furthermore, each time the Wild symbol appears during the free spins, a player will get additional free spins, up to five. The Scatter symbol also offers attractive multipliers, depending on how many times it appears on the reels. Finally, the Wild symbol (the Eye of Horus) behaves as an expandable symbol on all six reels during free spins, increasing the number of free spins, and determining the most substantial wins up to a jackpot of 10,000 times the bet.\n\nJackpot Potential\n\nEye of Horus Megaways offers players a chance to win a jackpot of 10,000 times the initial bet during free spins. Despite the lack of a progressive jackpot, this is still a massive payout that could attract players. With each spin, players have a chance to gain a big win, making the game exciting and potentially lucrative.\n\n        \n            ",

This game is a revisited and modernized version of the historic slot Eye of Horus, also from Blueprint. Wins are obtained when there is a combination of at least three identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right. The theme is Ancient Egypt, widely used in the world of slot machines, but here it accompanies a fairly articulated gameplay, made special by the recent Megaways gaming system. As for the graphic department, Blueprint has wisely decided to maintain the style and images of the previous version, updating them, and making them more modern but focusing mainly on the new slot's gameplay mode.\n\nRegular and Special Symbols of Eye of Horus Megaways\nAs in every respectable slot, it is also possible to know the value of all symbols in advance by consulting the paytable in Eye of Horus Megaways. Among the non-themed regular symbols, we find the numbers and letters referring to playing cards from J to Ace (the so-called royal symbols), which determine a maximum win equal to 0.4 times the initial bet. Next to these are the thematic symbols related to the culture of Ancient Egypt, including the Ankh cross, the sacred blue scarab, the falcon, the god Anubi with features halfway between human and canine, and of course, the Eye of Horus, which is also the game's Wild and can substitute for all other symbols to complete winning combinations. As for the Scatter, this is represented by an ancient golden temple and allows access to the special features of Eye of Horus Megaways.\n\nSpecial Features of Eye of Horus Megaways\nActually, more than special features, we should talk about a single extra feature, namely the free spins. If three to six Scatters (the golden temple) appear on the reels, 12 free spins are automatically activated, and more (up to five) will be awarded each time the Wild symbol appears during the free spins. Moreover, the Scatter symbol not only gives free spins but also delicious multipliers: depending on how many times it appears on the reels, it determines winnings up to one hundred times the initial bet. Finally, regarding the Wild (the Eye of Horus), we add that during free spins, in addition to increasing the number of free spins, it also behaves as an expandable symbol on all six reels, determining the most substantial wins, up to a jackpot of 10,000 times the bet!\n        ",
