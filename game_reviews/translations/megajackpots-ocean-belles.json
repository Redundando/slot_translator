IGT has incorporated pin-ups, boats, and the sea into this game, making it a unique and charming online slot game.\n\nVisual Appeal – A Beautiful Slot Game Set on a Luxurious Ship\n\nThe slot game is set on a luxurious ship with a stunning blue sea lining the horizon. Megajackpots Ocean Belles has a simple game grid, making the symbols stand out. The pin-up girls illustrated in 1950s style are the main attraction, along with other symbols such as binoculars, a captain's hat, a steering wheel, and playing card symbols with a shiny and sparkling look.\n\nGame Structure and Pay Lines – A Welcome Change from IGT's Traditional Formats\n\nMegajackpots Ocean Belles has a 5*4 skeleton, with a total of 20 symbols on the reels, which is a welcome change from IGT's traditional formats. It has 75 pay lines and is one of the most engaging online slot games. The game has wild symbols that can expand along the entire reel, giving gamers the possibility of obtaining significant wins, and a Bonus feature that initiates the free spins feature.\n\nSpecial Features – Wild Symbols and Bonus Rounds\n\nMegajackpots Ocean Belles has several special features that make the game more engaging. The wild symbols can expand to cover the entire reel, providing the chance of more substantial wins. The Bonus feature, on the other hand, grants gamers access to the free spins feature, where they can win big.\n\nRecommendation for Slot Games Similar to Megajackpots Ocean Belles\n\nThe theme of pin-ups is not widespread in online slot games. If gamers are looking for similar slot games, they could try WorldMatch's 50s Pin-Up, which is also inspired by pin-ups and provides gamers with an exciting experience.\n\n        \n            ",

Women, regardless of the context in which they find themselves, whether it be fantasy, historical, or modern, become so, making them excellent gaming companions.\nMegajackpots Ocean Belles from IGT is inspired by a phenomenon born during the First World War: pin-ups. Voluptuous and beautiful girls painted or photographed on colorful posters. In Megajackpots Ocean Belles, pin-ups join the theme of boats and the sea, making the slot even more unique.\nOur review begins by analyzing the aesthetic aspect of this delightful slot game.\nMegajackpots Ocean Belles – The Charm of Pin-ups\nSet on the deck of a luxurious ship with a beautiful blue sea lining the horizon, Megajackpots Ocean Belles immediately gives the impression of a visually pleasing slot game.\nThe game grid is very simple, allowing the symbols to stand out more. As the theme of this Megajackpots Ocean Belles is pin-ups, we won't be disappointed as we'll find attractive and smiling girls illustrated in 1950s style representing the symbols of the slot game.\nBut along with the pin-ups, we'll also see other symbols such as the impression of a lipstick-veiled kiss, or more maritime-inspired symbols like binoculars, a captain's hat, a steering wheel, and even the bonus symbol represented by a lighthouse.\nThe playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J) are also present. Generally, these symbols are the least cared for as they need to be immediately recognizable. In Megajackpots Ocean Belles, they have a shiny and sparkling look that perfectly matches the rest of the illustrations.\nFrom a sound point of view, Megajackpots Ocean Belles is, however, inconsistent. On the one hand, we have a playful and catchy music theme, on the other hand, there are sounds that clash with the setting. Such as the inevitable bell that is annoying and too noisy.\nBut let's move on to the technical part.\nMegajackpots Ocean Belles – Let's get to the heart of the slot\nAs a game developer, IGT usually uses two winning formulas for its slot games: either the 5*3 pattern, shared by most online titles, or a prism-shaped structure with reels that expand towards the center.\nThis makes it welcome news to discover the structure on which Megajackpots Ocean Belles is based: unlike its IGT cousins, in this case, we have a 5*4 skeleton. While the number of reels remains the same, the symbols shown on each of them increase to four, reaching twenty symbols compared to the fifteen of the 5*3 and the nineteen of the prism.\nMegajackpots Ocean Belles has 75 pay lines and is rich in special features, including Wild symbols (represented by one of the pinups) that can expand along the entire reel, thus giving the possibility of obtaining very interesting wins.\nThe Bonus, on the other hand, allows access to the free spins feature.\nSlot Games similar to Megajackpots Ocean Belles\nThe theme of pin-ups, while being a feast for the eyes and spirit, is not particularly widespread in the world of online slots, but it is still possible to find some titles that suit our tastes. Among these, we definitely recommend WorldMatch's 50s Pin-Up, which moves along the same style as the slot game we have dedicated ourselves to today.\n        ",
