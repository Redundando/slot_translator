Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGraphics\nBonus Features\nMusic\nGameplay Mechanics\nUser Interface\nPopularity\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Atop a mystical mountain lies the temple dedicated to the 9 Lions, ancient deities that bring fortune to their true followers. Alongside other fortune deities and their special bonuses, these beasts create an extraordinary experience that has garnered exceptional popularity among the crowds!\n\nBut gameplay is not the only exceptional element of this game. What has brought it to its enormous popularity is the enchanting graphics - detailed backgrounds, an elegant and functional user interface, and splendid symbols. Together with a pleasant background music, they create a truly rewarding experience.\n\nThousands of players can't be wrong - you will fall in love with 9 Lions immediately!\n\nExtraordinary graphics\n\nChinese-themed slots are expected to do things in a certain way and offer lots of red and gold, which can sometimes be a challenge for designers. But 9 Lions have excellently designed this theme, making it probably the most beautiful slot game of its kind. All symbols are meticulously drawn in high definition and vivid colors, the background offers a welcome relief from all the red and gold, and the sound effects are good. The animations are also impressive. All this combines into a pleasant experience for the player.\n\n9 Lions has 3 reels and 9 paylines. Play this slot game at selected Wazdan casinos with the best casino bonuses.\n\n9 Lions is a Chinese-themed 3x3 slot game from Wazdan, released in September 2018. The game offers interesting gameplay mechanics where you can hold symbols from the previous spin, which greatly increases your chances of winning in the next spin!\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\n\nThe lion and dragon icons can also trigger bonus rounds when you have collected enough of them.\n\nThus, the dragons will launch a picking round when you have three on the middle reel. You must choose one of the three icons to define the instant payout. The reward can range from 1,000 to 10,000 credits.\n\nThe lion has the power to launch 9 free spins with sticky symbols. To do this, you need to take two steps:\n\nCollect nine pictures of a golden lion and put them on the matrix field next to the grid;\n\nLand three lion pictograms simultaneously when the matrix field is full.\n\nEach new creature that appears on the screen during the function will land in its position. If you have at least four lions in view at the end of the bonus, an additional prize will be paid.\n\nAfter each spin, the player can choose to start a new spin or hold some of the symbols from the previous spin. Some symbols will be automatically highlighted as held, although the way the player deselects these symbols and proceeds with a new spin. The player can then influence this game a lot, and decisions are very important.\n\nThe main feature of the game is the Lions bonus. Every time a Lion symbol lands on the reels, it is collected in its respective position, and when all nine positions are filled with collected Lion symbols, the next time you land three Lions, 9 free spins are unleashed. These Lions will remain locked and will be joined by all other Lions that land during the free spins. If there are at least four Lions on the reels at the end of the action, a prize will be awarded.\n\nDragons Bonus is a bonus feature that is activated when you land three Dragon symbols, one on each reel. The player can then choose one of the three Dragon icons to reveal a cash prize.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\n\nLions have always inspired fear and reverence, both in relation to other animals of the savannah and to human beings: for this reason, they are identified as kings, being the strongest, among all animals. If you too are passionate about lions, we can suggest the 50 Lions Slot Machine, the slot produced by Aristocrat with a whopping 50 paylines.\n            ",

Alongside other fortune deities and their special bonuses, these beasts create an extraordinary experience that has garnered exceptional popularity among the crowds!\n\nBut gameplay is not the only exceptional element of this game.

Together with a pleasant background music, they create a truly rewarding experience.\n\nThousands of players can't be wrong - you will fall in love with 9 Lions immediately!\n\nExtraordinary graphics\n\nChinese-themed slots are expected to do things in a certain way and offer lots of red and gold, which can sometimes be a challenge for designers. But 9 Lions have excellently designed this theme, making it probably the most beautiful slot game of its kind. All symbols are meticulously drawn in high definition and vivid colors, the background offers a welcome relief from all the red and gold, and the sound effects are good. The animations are also impressive. All this combines into a pleasant experience for the player.\n\n9 Lions has 3 reels and 9 paylines. Play this slot game at selected Wazdan casinos with the best casino bonuses.\n\n9 Lions is a Chinese-themed 3x3 slot game from Wazdan, released in September 2018. The game offers interesting gameplay mechanics where you can hold symbols from the previous spin, which greatly increases your chances of winning in the next spin!\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\n\nThe lion and dragon icons can also trigger bonus rounds when you have collected enough of them.\n\nThus, the dragons will launch a picking round when you have three on the middle reel. You must choose one of the three icons to define the instant payout. The reward can range from 1,000 to 10,000 credits.\n\nThe lion has the power to launch 9 free spins with sticky symbols. To do this, you need to take two steps:\n\nCollect nine pictures of a golden lion and put them on the matrix field next to the grid;\n\nLand three lion pictograms simultaneously when the matrix field is full.\n\nEach new creature that appears on the screen during the function will land in its position. If you have at least four lions in view at the end of the bonus, an additional prize will be paid.\n\nAfter each spin, the player can choose to start a new spin or hold some of the symbols from the previous spin. Some symbols will be automatically highlighted as held, although the way the player deselects these symbols and proceeds with a new spin. The player can then influence this game a lot, and decisions are very important.\n\nThe main feature of the game is the Lions bonus. Every time a Lion symbol lands on the reels, it is collected in its respective position, and when all nine positions are filled with collected Lion symbols, the next time you land three Lions, 9 free spins are unleashed. These Lions will remain locked and will be joined by all other Lions that land during the free spins. If there are at least four Lions on the reels at the end of the action, a prize will be awarded.\n\nDragons Bonus is a bonus feature that is activated when you land three Dragon symbols, one on each reel. The player can then choose one of the three Dragon icons to reveal a cash prize.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\n\nLions have always inspired fear and reverence, both in relation to other animals of the savannah and to human beings: for this reason, they are identified as kings, being the strongest, among all animals. If you too are passionate about lions, we can suggest the 50 Lions Slot Machine, the slot produced by Aristocrat with a whopping 50 paylines.\n        ",
