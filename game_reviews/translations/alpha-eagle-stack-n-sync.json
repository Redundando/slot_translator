It lives in the mountains and hunts fish, especially salmon; therefore, it is possible to spot it near lakes and rivers. The software company Hacksaw Gaming has dedicated a slot to this beautiful animal, creating a background of snowy mountains that can be admired on the entire screen thanks to the transparent game grid. The graphics of the icons are truly beautiful, with symbols carved into stone and the choice of cool colors that help you dive even deeper into the game's atmosphere during this winter period. The music that accompanies the spins is a catchy tune composed with a keyboard, reminiscent of the typical sound of the 80s.\n\nAn excellent RTP\nThe 20 fixed paylines are arranged on a grid of 5 reels and 4 rows on which you can bet a minimum of €0.10 and a maximum of €100. Automatic spins allow us to play without having to worry about clicking the Play button every time, while accessing the internal menu allows you to activate the Turbo function to speed up the rotation of the reels. To win, you must match three to five identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel towards the right.\n\nThe volatility is high, while the RTP percentage is 96.26%.\n\nAn interesting bonus system\nAs often happens, the symbols that pay the least are the playing cards that make up a royal flush, from ten to ace. For higher winnings, there are thematic symbols such as feathers, salmon, ford, egg, and eagle head. Among the special symbols, we find the Wild, which not only replaces all symbols except for bonus ones but also pays as much as the eagle head when five Wilds land. The nest with the S'N'S writing is another special symbol. In this case, the entire reel where the writing appeared is transformed into a random symbol, and a Respin is triggered. Not only basic symbols but also the Scatter can be stacked, which we will see shortly, and the Wild.

In addition, this symbol activates a multiplier from 2x up to a maximum of 100x.\n\nWe then have two Scatters: the first is represented by the FS writing and assigns as many Free Spins as there are Scatters. The second Scatter, the eagle's talons, activates a special game where only eagle symbols and golden eagle symbols appear. There are three respins during which all eagle symbols stick to the reels. In the second phase, all eagle and golden eagle symbols are linked and paid.\n\nThese features can also be purchased through the Bonus button.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow many bonus symbols are present in Alpha Eagle Stack N Sync?\n\nIn this slot, we have five bonuses: the Wild, the FS symbol, two versions of the S'N'S symbol, and the bird of prey's talons.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player rate?\n\nIn Alpha Eagle Stack N Sync, the RTP value is 96.26%.\n\nWhat are the minimum and maximum bets?\n\nYou can start with €0.20 per spin up to a maximum of €100.\n            ",

Additionally, the game boasts an excellent RTP percentage of 96.26%.\n\nBonus Symbol System\n\nThis slot has five bonus symbols that include two versions of S'N'S scatter, Wild, FS, and bird of prey's talons. While the Wild acts as a substitute for all other symbols except the bonus ones, the nest with the S'N'S writing appearing on the reel transforms the entire reel into a random symbol with a Respin.

It lives in the mountains and hunts fish, especially salmon; therefore, it is possible to spot it near lakes and rivers. The software company Hacksaw Gaming has dedicated a slot to this beautiful animal, creating a background of snowy mountains that can be admired on the entire screen thanks to the transparent game grid. The graphics of the icons are truly beautiful, with symbols carved into stone and the choice of cool colors that help you dive even deeper into the game's atmosphere during this winter period. The music that accompanies the spins is a catchy tune composed with a keyboard, reminiscent of the typical sound of the 80s.\n\nAn excellent RTP\nThe 20 fixed paylines are arranged on a grid of 5 reels and 4 rows on which you can bet a minimum of €0.10 and a maximum of €100. Automatic spins allow us to play without having to worry about clicking the Play button every time, while accessing the internal menu allows you to activate the Turbo function to speed up the rotation of the reels. To win, you must match three to five identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel towards the right.\n\nThe volatility is high, while the RTP percentage is 96.26%.\n\nAn interesting bonus system\nAs often happens, the symbols that pay the least are the playing cards that make up a royal flush, from ten to ace. For higher winnings, there are thematic symbols such as feathers, salmon, ford, egg, and eagle head. Among the special symbols, we find the Wild, which not only replaces all symbols except for bonus ones but also pays as much as the eagle head when five Wilds land. The nest with the S'N'S writing is another special symbol. In this case, the entire reel where the writing appeared is transformed into a random symbol, and a Respin is triggered. Not only basic symbols but also the Scatter can be stacked, which we will see shortly, and the Wild. There is a golden version of the S'N'S symbol, where all the grid reels can be stacked with Wild or Scatter. In addition, this symbol activates a multiplier from 2x up to a maximum of 100x.\n\nWe then have two Scatters: the first is represented by the FS writing and assigns as many Free Spins as there are Scatters. The second Scatter, the eagle's talons, activates a special game where only eagle symbols and golden eagle symbols appear. There are three respins during which all eagle symbols stick to the reels. In the second phase, all eagle and golden eagle symbols are linked and paid.\n\nThese features can also be purchased through the Bonus button.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow many bonus symbols are present in Alpha Eagle Stack N Sync?\n\nIn this slot, we have five bonuses: the Wild, the FS symbol, two versions of the S'N'S symbol, and the bird of prey's talons.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player rate?\n\nIn Alpha Eagle Stack N Sync, the RTP value is 96.26%.\n\nWhat are the minimum and maximum bets?\n\nYou can start with €0.20 per spin up to a maximum of €100.\n            ",

It lives in the mountains and hunts fish, especially salmon; therefore, it is possible to spot it near lakes and rivers. The software company Hacksaw Gaming has dedicated a slot to this beautiful animal, creating a background of snowy mountains that can be admired on the entire screen thanks to the transparent game grid. The graphics of the icons are truly beautiful, with symbols carved into stone and the choice of cool colors that help you dive even deeper into the game's atmosphere during this winter period. The music that accompanies the spins is a catchy tune composed with a keyboard, reminiscent of the typical sound of the 80s.\n\nAn excellent RTP\nThe 20 fixed paylines are arranged on a grid of 5 reels and 4 rows on which you can bet a minimum of €0.10 and a maximum of €100. Automatic spins allow us to play without having to worry about clicking the Play button every time, while accessing the internal menu allows you to activate the Turbo function to speed up the rotation of the reels. To win, you must match three to five identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel towards the right.\n\nThe volatility is high, while the RTP percentage is 96.26%.\n\nAn interesting bonus system\nAs often happens, the symbols that pay the least are the playing cards that make up a royal flush, from ten to ace. For higher winnings, there are thematic symbols such as feathers, salmon, ford, egg, and eagle head. Among the special symbols, we find the Wild, which not only replaces all symbols except for bonus ones but also pays as much as the eagle head when five Wilds land. The nest with the S'N'S writing is another special symbol. In this case, the entire reel where the writing appeared is transformed into a random symbol, and a Respin is triggered. Not only basic symbols but also the Scatter can be stacked, which we will see shortly, and the Wild. There is a golden version of the S'N'S symbol, where all the grid reels can be stacked with Wild or Scatter. In addition, this symbol activates a multiplier from 2x up to a maximum of 100x.\n\nWe then have two Scatters: the first is represented by the FS writing and assigns as many Free Spins as there are Scatters. The second Scatter, the eagle's talons, activates a special game where only eagle symbols and golden eagle symbols appear. There are three respins during which all eagle symbols stick to the reels. In the second phase, all eagle and golden eagle symbols are linked and paid.\n\nThese features can also be purchased through the Bonus button.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow many bonus symbols are present in Alpha Eagle Stack N Sync?\n\nIn this slot, we have five bonuses: the Wild, the FS symbol, two versions of the S'N'S symbol, and the bird of prey's talons.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player rate?\n\nIn Alpha Eagle Stack N Sync, the RTP value is 96.26%.\n\nWhat are the minimum and maximum bets?\n\nYou can start with €0.20 per spin up to a maximum of €100.\n            ",
