This action-packed gangster-themed game features a band of wild felines and free spins with multipliers that allow you to choose your preferred level of volatility. There’s also a standalone top prize of 350 coins to play for, and plenty of potential in the 96% RTP.\n\nIt's a slot game that allows you to influence its volatility by customizing the combination of free spins and multipliers available in the bonus feature. Choose more spins and lower multipliers or fewer spins with greater winning potential, according to your preferred style of play.\n\nFour-legged criminals roam the streets at night. Perhaps they wander alone through the infamous alleys, or maybe they head downtown to hang out with the Cat Gangster. In this fun High 5 Games slot, a band of furballs wreak havoc in Miaowtown.\n\nJohnny Ginger and his mole sidekick, Pretty Paws Bastet, make their way through the city, relying on a stroke of luck to beat their archenemies, Ricky \"the Rat\" Rotten the greyhound and the gang boss, Big Al the bulldog. The images have a comic book vibe that really captures the theme - even the playing card values are decorated in coordinated style, and the nightclub diva could have stepped off the reels of Miss Kitty's slot.\n\nThis slot is played on a diamond-shaped reel set that lends itself to landscape orientation when played on mobile. In the background are the seedy dives and alleys frequented by the feline gangsters, rendered in perfect noir comic book style.\n\nH5G has taken the familiar tropes of Chicago gangsters and film noir, mashed them together with the animal kingdom, and added a nice jazz soundtrack to create this impressive-looking space.\n\nThe RTP of any slot is calculated by averaging the return on a 100-bet over thousands of games. In the case of Cat Gangster, the RTP is 96%, making it a highly playable slot.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nWinning at slots is usually a matter of landing matching symbols on a payline. But not in the case of Cat Gangster. Instead, this slot uses a multiways payline mechanism to create winning combinations.\n\nThis means you're looking for matching symbols that land on adjacent reels that read from left to right. This type of game engine is also sometimes known as scatter pays, because symbols can pay out when they appear anywhere in view, so long as they're on nearby swings.\n\nThe number of ways to pay is calculated by multiplying the number of reels together - in the case of Cat Gangster, that's provided by an unusual 3-4-4-4-3 layout. The base game is not the most lucrative feature of this slot - the biggest payout is 350 credits when you land 5 red cat symbols on adjacent reels.\n\nThere are two special symbols to watch out for in Cat Gangster, which are the ways to access the bonus features and increase your bankroll.\n\nTo unlock Cat Gangster's full potential, you must break down the door of the Kit Kat club and trigger the free spins bonus. This allows you to choose your volatility and play for small or big wins depending on your risk level and reward preference.\n\nCat Gangster wild: The game's logo symbol spins on reels 2, 3, and 4 to substitute any symbol except the Kit Kat Club scatter. This symbol arrives stacked and can help create winning combinations across the reels.\n\nKit Kat Club Free Spins: What lies beyond the door of the mysterious Kit Kat Club? Land 3 in any position on reels 2, 3, and 4, and you'll find out. The free spins bonus is played on a set of new reels, but first, you'll have to make a choice. There are 4 options:\n\n5 free spins with multipliers of 7x, 10x, and 15x\n7 free spins with multipliers of 5x, 7x, and 10x\n10 free spins with multipliers of 3x, 5x, and 7x\n15 free spins with multipliers of 2x, 3x, and 5x\n\nDuring the free spins, the multipliers you selected will spin as wild symbols that can substitute for any other game symbol, offering huge potential. Unfortunately, the free spins bonus can't be retriggered, so when the games are over, it's back to the base game.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf four-legged criminals aren't filling your pockets with enough dirty money, why not rub shoulders with the gangsters of Chicago? Powered by Playson, this suspenseful slot takes you back to the 1930s, where you could cash in on a thriving bootlegging operation with one of three jackpots.",

This action-packed gangster-themed slot features a band of wild felines and free spins with multipliers that allow you to customize the level of volatility that suits your style of play. There's also a top standalone prize of 350 coins to play for and plenty of potential in the 96% RTP.\n\nThis is a slot that lets you influence its volatility by customizing the combination of free spins and multipliers available in the bonus feature. Choose more spins and lower multipliers or fewer spins with a higher potential win according to your gambling preferences.\n\nFour-legged criminals\n\nWhere does your cat go at night? Maybe they wander alone on the mean streets – or maybe they head to the city center to hang out with the Cat Gangster. In this fun High 5 Games slot, there's a gang of felons creating mayhem in Miaowtown.\n\nJohnny Ginger and his mole Pretty Paws Bastet roam the city, making their way through their sworn enemies Ricky 'the Rat' Rotten the Greyhound and gang boss Big Al the Bulldog. The visuals have a comic book atmosphere that captures the theme - even the card symbols are decorated in a coordinated style, while the nightclub diva could have stepped right off the reels of Miss Kitty's slot.\n\nThis slot is played on a diamond-shaped reel set that lends itself to landscape orientation when playing on mobile. In the background are the seedy dives and alleys frequented by cat gangsters rendered in perfect noir comic book style.\n\nH5G has taken the familiar tropes of Chicago gangsters and film noir, crushed them together with the animal kingdom, and added a beautiful jazz soundtrack to create this impressive-looking space.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nWinning at slots is usually a matter of landing matching symbols on a payline. But not in the case of Cat Gangster. Instead, this slot uses a multiways payline mechanism to create winning combinations.\n\nThis means that you're looking for matching symbols that land on adjacent reels reading from the leftmost one. This type of game engine is also sometimes known as scatter pays, because symbols can pay out when they appear anywhere in view, as long as they're on adjacent reels.\n\nThe number of ways to win is calculated by multiplying the number of reels together - in the case of Cat Gangster, which is provided by an unusual 3-4-4-4-3 layout. The base game is not the most lucrative feature of this slot - the biggest payout is 350 credits when landing 5 red cat symbols on adjacent reels.\n\nThere are two special symbols to keep an eye out for in Cat Gangster that are the ways to access bonus features and increase your bankroll.\n\nTo unlock the full potential of Cat Gangster, you must break down the door of the Kit Kat club and trigger the free spins bonus. This allows you to choose your volatility and play for small or big wins depending on the level of risk and reward you prefer.\n\nCat Gangster Wild: The game's logo symbol spins on reels 2, 3, and 4 to replace any symbol except the Kit Kat Club scatter. This symbol arrives stacked and can help create winning combinations across the reels.\n\nKit Kat Club Free Spins: What's beyond the door of the mysterious Kit Kat Club? Land 3 in any position on reels 2, 3, and 4 and you'll find out. The free spins bonus is played on a set of new reels, but first you'll have to make a choice. There are 4 options:\n\n5 free spins with 7x, 10x, and 15x multipliers\n7 free spins with 5x, 7x, and 10x multipliers\n10 free spins with 3x, 5x, and 7x multipliers\n15 free spins with 2x, 3x, and 5x multipliers\n\nDuring free spins, the multipliers you chose will spin as wild symbols that can replace any other game symbol, offering enormous potential. Unfortunately, the free spins bonus cannot be retriggered, so when the free games end, you return to the base game.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf four-legged criminals don't fill your pockets with dirty money enough, why not rub shoulders with Chicago gangsters? Powered by Playson, this suspenseful slot takes you back to the 1930s, where you could cash in on a booming bootlegging operation with one of three jackpots."

In the background are the seedy dives and alleys frequented by the feline gangsters, rendered in perfect noir comic book style.\n\nH5G has taken the familiar tropes of Chicago gangsters and film noir, mashed them together with the animal kingdom, and added a nice jazz soundtrack to create this impressive-looking space.\n\nThe RTP of any slot is calculated by averaging the return on a 100-bet over thousands of games. In the case of Cat Gangster, the RTP is 96%, making it a highly playable slot.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nWinning at slots is usually a matter of landing matching symbols on a payline. But not in the case of Cat Gangster. Instead, this slot uses a multiways payline mechanism to create winning combinations.\n\nThis means you're looking for matching symbols that land on adjacent reels that read from left to right. This type of game engine is also sometimes known as scatter pays, because symbols can pay out when they appear anywhere in view, so long as they're on nearby swings.\n\nThe number of ways to pay is calculated by multiplying the number of reels together - in the case of Cat Gangster, that's provided by an unusual 3-4-4-4-3 layout. The base game is not the most lucrative feature of this slot - the biggest payout is 350 credits when you land 5 red cat symbols on adjacent reels.\n\nThere are two special symbols to watch out for in Cat Gangster, which are the ways to access the bonus features and increase your bankroll.\n\nTo unlock Cat Gangster's full potential, you must break down the door of the Kit Kat club and trigger the free spins bonus. This allows you to choose your volatility and play for small or big wins depending on your risk level and reward preference.\n\nCat Gangster wild: The game's logo symbol spins on reels 2, 3, and 4 to substitute any symbol except the Kit Kat Club scatter. This symbol arrives stacked and can help create winning combinations across the reels.\n\nKit Kat Club Free Spins: What lies beyond the door of the mysterious Kit Kat Club? Land 3 in any position on reels 2, 3, and 4, and you'll find out. The free spins bonus is played on a set of new reels, but first, you'll have to make a choice. There are 4 options:\n\n5 free spins with multipliers of 7x, 10x, and 15x\n7 free spins with multipliers of 5x, 7x, and 10x\n10 free spins with multipliers of 3x, 5x, and 7x\n15 free spins with multipliers of 2x, 3x, and 5x\n\nDuring the free spins, the multipliers you selected will spin as wild symbols that can substitute for any other game symbol, offering huge potential. Unfortunately, the free spins bonus can't be retriggered, so when the games are over, it's back to the base game.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf four-legged criminals aren't filling your pockets with enough dirty money, why not rub shoulders with the gangsters of Chicago? Powered by Playson, this suspenseful slot takes you back to the 1930s, where you could cash in on a thriving bootlegging operation with one of three jackpots.\n            ",

The game features a multiways payline mechanism, which means winning combinations are created by landing matching symbols that appear on adjacent reels. Symbols are read from left to right. Cat Gangster also features a scatter pays game engine, meaning symbols can pay out when they appear anywhere in view, so long as they're on nearby swings.\n\nBonus Features\n\nCat Gangster has two special symbols that unlock the bonus features of the game: the Cat Gangster wild and the Kit Kat Club Free Spins. The Cat Gangster wild symbol is the game's logo, which spins on reels 2, 3, and 4 to substitute any symbol except the Kit Kat Club scatter. The Kit Kat Club Free Spins symbol is the scatter that unlocks the free spins bonus game when you land 3 in any position on the reels. During the free spins, the multipliers you selected will spin as wild symbols and can substitute for any other game symbol, offering huge potential.\n\nVolatility Options\n\nCat Gangster allows you to choose your preferred level of volatility. There are four options for free spins and multipliers available in the bonus feature. You can choose between more spins and lower multipliers or fewer spins with greater winning potential, according to your preferred style of play.\n\nTheme and Graphics\n\nCat Gangster is a fun slot game featuring a band of wild feline gangsters. The images have a comic book vibe that really captures the theme of the game. The playing card values are also decorated in a coordinated style, and the nightclub diva adds to the overall feeling of the slot. The game is set against a backdrop of the seedy dives and alleys frequented by the feline gangsters, rendered in perfect noir comic book style. H5G has taken the familiar tropes of Chicago gangsters and film noir, mashed them together with the animal kingdom, and added a nice jazz soundtrack to create this impressive-looking space.\n\nPotential for Wins\n\nIn the base game, the biggest payout is 350 credits when you land 5 red cat symbols on adjacent reels. The RTP of Cat Gangster is 96%, making it a highly playable slot. There's also potential for big wins during the free spins bonus feature thanks to the multipliers that spin as wild symbols and can substitute for any other game symbol, offering huge potential.\n\nGame Controls and Layout\n\nCat Gangster is played on a diamond-shaped reel set that lends itself to landscape orientation when played on mobile. The game controls are easy to use with buttons for adjusting the bet amount, spinning the reels, and accessing the paytable. The layout of the game is clear and simple, allowing for an immersive gameplay experience.\n\nCompatibility on Mobile Devices\n\nCat Gangster was designed using HTML5, making it compatible with a range of devices, including smartphones and tablets that run on Android and iOS operating systems. The game is optimized for mobile play, ensuring a seamless gameplay experience on smaller screens. The layout and controls are designed to be user-friendly and easily navigable on mobile devices.\n\n        \n            ",

This action-packed gangster-themed game features a band of wild felines and free spins with multipliers that allow you to choose your preferred level of volatility. There’s also a standalone top prize of 350 coins to play for, and plenty of potential in the 96% RTP.\n\nIt's a slot game that allows you to influence its volatility by customizing the combination of free spins and multipliers available in the bonus feature. Choose more spins and lower multipliers or fewer spins with greater winning potential, according to your preferred style of play.\n\nFour-legged criminals roam the streets at night. Perhaps they wander alone through the infamous alleys, or maybe they head downtown to hang out with the Cat Gangster. In this fun High 5 Games slot, a band of furballs wreak havoc in Miaowtown.\n\nJohnny Ginger and his mole sidekick, Pretty Paws Bastet, make their way through the city, relying on a stroke of luck to beat their archenemies, Ricky \"the Rat\" Rotten the greyhound and the gang boss, Big Al the bulldog. The images have a comic book vibe that really captures the theme - even the playing card values are decorated in coordinated style, and the nightclub diva could have stepped off the reels of Miss Kitty's slot.\n\nThis slot is played on a diamond-shaped reel set that lends itself to landscape orientation when played on mobile. In the background are the seedy dives and alleys frequented by the feline gangsters, rendered in perfect noir comic book style.\n\nH5G has taken the familiar tropes of Chicago gangsters and film noir, mashed them together with the animal kingdom, and added a nice jazz soundtrack to create this impressive-looking space.\n\nThe RTP of any slot is calculated by averaging the return on a 100-bet over thousands of games. In the case of Cat Gangster, the RTP is 96%, making it a highly playable slot.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nWinning at slots is usually a matter of landing matching symbols on a payline. But not in the case of Cat Gangster. Instead, this slot uses a multiways payline mechanism to create winning combinations.\n\nThis means you're looking for matching symbols that land on adjacent reels that read from left to right. This type of game engine is also sometimes known as scatter pays, because symbols can pay out when they appear anywhere in view, so long as they're on nearby swings.\n\nThe number of ways to pay is calculated by multiplying the number of reels together - in the case of Cat Gangster, that's provided by an unusual 3-4-4-4-3 layout. The base game is not the most lucrative feature of this slot - the biggest payout is 350 credits when you land 5 red cat symbols on adjacent reels.\n\nThere are two special symbols to watch out for in Cat Gangster, which are the ways to access the bonus features and increase your bankroll.\n\nTo unlock Cat Gangster's full potential, you must break down the door of the Kit Kat club and trigger the free spins bonus. This allows you to choose your volatility and play for small or big wins depending on your risk level and reward preference.\n\nCat Gangster wild: The game's logo symbol spins on reels 2, 3, and 4 to substitute any symbol except the Kit Kat Club scatter. This symbol arrives stacked and can help create winning combinations across the reels.\n\nKit Kat Club Free Spins: What lies beyond the door of the mysterious Kit Kat Club? Land 3 in any position on reels 2, 3, and 4, and you'll find out. The free spins bonus is played on a set of new reels, but first, you'll have to make a choice. There are 4 options:\n\n5 free spins with multipliers of 7x, 10x, and 15x\n7 free spins with multipliers of 5x, 7x, and 10x\n10 free spins with multipliers of 3x, 5x, and 7x\n15 free spins with multipliers of 2x, 3x, and 5x\n\nDuring the free spins, the multipliers you selected will spin as wild symbols that can substitute for any other game symbol, offering huge potential. Unfortunately, the free spins bonus can't be retriggered, so when the games are over, it's back to the base game.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf four-legged criminals aren't filling your pockets with enough dirty money, why not rub shoulders with the gangsters of Chicago? Powered by Playson, this suspenseful slot takes you back to the 1930s, where you could cash in on a thriving bootlegging operation with one of three jackpots.\n            ",

Land 3 in any position on reels 2, 3, and 4, and you'll find out. The free spins bonus is played on a set of new reels, but first, you'll have to make a choice. There are 4 options:\n\n5 free spins with multipliers of 7x, 10x, and 15x\n7 free spins with multipliers of 5x, 7x, and 10x\n10 free spins with multipliers of 3x, 5x, and 7x\n15 free spins with multipliers of 2x, 3x, and 5x\n\nDuring the free spins, the multipliers you selected will spin as wild symbols that can substitute for any other game symbol, offering huge potential.

The image should have a fun and playful vibe and represent the game's gangster theme. The background should feature some seedy downtown alleyways, as this is where the action takes place. The image should also incorporate some of the game's symbols, such as the cat gangster, the logo symbol, and the Kit Kat Club symbol. Overall, the image should capture the essence of the game and entice players to give it a spin."
