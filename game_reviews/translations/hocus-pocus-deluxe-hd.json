Rowling e del suo maghetto Harry Potter a un vero e proprio ribaltone di questo tema, che anche nell’ambito del gioco online e delle slot machine in particolare, trova ampi spazi con prodotti sempre nuovi e all’avanguardia.\nHocus Pocus Deluxe fa parte del catalogo della software house tedesca Merkur Gaming, che da sempre si distingue per un’offerta ampia e variegata, tale da farla diventare uno dei colossi indiscussi nel settore del gaming online.\nIl protagonista di Hocus Pocus Deluxe (non poteva essere altrimenti), è un austero stregone con lunga barba e capelli argentei, che scruta i giocatori da sotto un caratteristico capello a punta.\nIl compartimento grafico di Hocus Pocus Deluxe è abbastanza ben curato, sebbene non siano presenti animazioni tridimensionali o particolari effetti speciali: l’atmosfera è cupa e coinvolgente, e ci si ritrova catapultati dentro la stanza segreta dello stregone, per un’esperienza di gioco davvero affascinante.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nHocus Pocus Deluxe è una slot machine con una struttura di gioco tradizionale, costituita da cinque rulli, tre righe e 40 linee di pagamento. Su questo gioco è possibile effettuare delle puntate a partire da un minimo di 40 centesimi fino a un massimo di 20 €, range piuttosto ristretto ma che rende la slot accessibile anche a coloro che non amano investire grandi somme.\nUna nota molto positiva di Hocus Pocus Deluxe è rappresentata dall’eccezionale ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP), che attestandosi su un altissimo 97,47% rende possibile un ottimo ritorno economico e, in virtù della volatilità media, delle vincite che sono costanti e anche di un certo valore.\nHocus Pocus Deluxe ha un gameplay che non presenta particolari funzioni speciali e per questo risulta essere facilmente accessibile anche dai principianti. Se poi volete provare la slot e scoprirne tutti i trucchi prima di investire dei soldi veri, lo potete fare grazie alla versione play for fun del tutto gratuita, a cui potrete giocare nella maggior parte dei casinò online.\nSimboli e funzionalità speciali di Hocus Pocus Deluxe\nConsultando la tabella dei pagamenti, grazie alla quale potrete conoscere nel dettaglio il valore di tutti i simboli in diverse combinazioni, troverete otto simboli regolari e due speciali.\nSi tratta di simboli tutti tematici e riconducibili al mondo della magia: abbiamo quattro forme geometriche (una piramide, un triangolo, un cerchio e un quadrato) che hanno un basso valore e pagano dagli 80 ai 200 crediti, ci sono poi il cappello del mago, uno strano oggetto magico e un libro di incantesimi. Il mago è il simbolo che ha valore maggiore, pagando 5.000 crediti per una combinazione di 5 icone uguali. Sono presenti un Wild con funzione di jolly (delle mani) e uno Scatter (la palla di vetro) che attiva 6 giri gratuiti in cui le vincite sono pagate il doppio se compare sui rulli un terzo simbolo speciale rappresentato da dei dadi.\nÈ presente una funzione Gamble: in seguito a una vincita di qualsiasi entità è possibile tentare ulteriormente la fortuna provando a raddoppiare il premio, o scegliendo il colore di una carta girata oppure con una scala della fortuna.\n",

On this game, you can place bets starting from a minimum of 40 cents up to a maximum of 20 €, a rather limited range but one that makes the slot accessible even to those who do not like to invest large sums. Hocus Pocus Deluxe has gameplay that does not feature particular special functions and is, therefore, easily accessible even to beginners. If you want to try the slot and discover all its tricks before investing real money, you can do so thanks to the entirely free play-for-fun version, which you can play in most online casinos.\n\nSymbol Values\n\nConsulting the paytable, thanks to which you can know in detail the value of all the symbols in various combinations, you will find eight regular symbols and two special ones. These are all thematic symbols related to the world of magic: we have four geometric shapes (a pyramid, a triangle, a circle, and a square) that have low value and pay from 80 to 200 credits. Then we have the wizard's hat, a strange magical object, and a spellbook. The wizard is the symbol with the highest value, paying 5,000 credits for a combination of 5 identical icons. There is a Wild with a joker function (hands) and a Scatter (the glass ball) that activates 6 free spins in which winnings are paid double if a third special symbol represented by dice appears on the reels.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP) Percentage\n\nA very positive note about Hocus Pocus Deluxe is represented by the exceptional theoretical return to the player (RTP), which, standing at a very high 97.47%, makes an excellent economic return possible and, due to the medium volatility, constant and also of some value winnings.\n\nVolatility\n\nHocus Pocus Deluxe has a medium volatility, which means that winnings are constant and of some value. This, combined with the high RTP, makes it an excellent choice for players who want to have fun and make some money without risking too much.\n\nGraphics and Theme\n\nThe graphic compartment of Hocus Pocus Deluxe is fairly well-cared for, albeit without three-dimensional animations or particular special effects: the atmosphere is dark and engaging, and you find yourself catapulted into the wizard's secret room for a truly fascinating gaming experience. The protagonist of Hocus Pocus Deluxe is an austere wizard with long silver beard and hair, who scrutinizes the players from under a characteristic pointed hat. The symbols and the special features are all inspired by the world of magic, with geometric shapes, magical objects, and the classic wizard's hat. Overall, Hocus Pocus Deluxe is an excellent example of a slot machine that combines a captivating theme with good gameplay and excellent economic returns.\n\n        \n            ",

Thanks to the brilliant mind of J.K. Rowling and her wizard Harry Potter, we have witnessed a true revolution in this theme, which also finds ample space in the world of online gaming and slot machines in particular, with always new and avant-garde products.\n\nHocus Pocus Deluxe is part of the catalog of the German software house Merkur Gaming, which has always stood out for its wide and varied offer, making it one of the undisputed giants in the online gaming industry.\n\nThe protagonist of Hocus Pocus Deluxe (it couldn't be otherwise) is an austere wizard with long silver beard and hair, who scrutinizes the players from under a characteristic pointed hat.\n\nThe graphic compartment of Hocus Pocus Deluxe is fairly well-cared for, albeit without three-dimensional animations or particular special effects: the atmosphere is dark and engaging, and you find yourself catapulted into the wizard's secret room for a truly fascinating gaming experience.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nHocus Pocus Deluxe is a slot machine with a traditional game structure, consisting of five reels, three rows, and 40 pay lines. On this game, you can place bets starting from a minimum of 40 cents up to a maximum of 20 €, a rather limited range but one that makes the slot accessible even to those who do not like to invest large sums.\n\nA very positive note about Hocus Pocus Deluxe is represented by the exceptional theoretical return to the player (RTP), which, standing at a very high 97.47%, makes an excellent economic return possible and, due to the medium volatility, constant and also of some value winnings.\n\nHocus Pocus Deluxe has gameplay that does not feature particular special functions and is, therefore, easily accessible even to beginners. If you want to try the slot and discover all its tricks before investing real money, you can do so thanks to the entirely free play-for-fun version, which you can play in most online casinos.\n\nSymbols and special features of Hocus Pocus Deluxe\n\nConsulting the paytable, thanks to which you can know in detail the value of all the symbols in various combinations, you will find eight regular symbols and two special ones.\n\nThese are all thematic symbols related to the world of magic: we have four geometric shapes (a pyramid, a triangle, a circle, and a square) that have low value and pay from 80 to 200 credits. Then we have the wizard's hat, a strange magical object, and a spellbook. The wizard is the symbol with the highest value, paying 5,000 credits for a combination of 5 identical icons. There is a Wild with a joker function (hands) and a Scatter (the glass ball) that activates 6 free spins in which winnings are paid double if a third special symbol represented by dice appears on the reels.\n\nThere is a Gamble function: after any win, it is possible to try your luck further by trying to double the prize, or by choosing the color of a turned card or with a fortune ladder.\n        ",
