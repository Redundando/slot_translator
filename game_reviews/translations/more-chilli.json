La software house australiana Aristocrat che ha realizzato questo gioco online, ha voluto rendere omaggio a questo colorato ed accogliente Paese, ricco di tradizioni tra cui il cibo piccante e saporito, utilizzando le tonalità del rosso, del giallo e del verde per ravvivare la schermata di gioco, un preciso riferimento ai colori della bandiera nazionale.\nUn gameplay con animazioni piccanti!\nLa slot gratis More Chilli, che non si deve scaricare, è formata da 5 rulli e da 25 payline multicolor, intervallate dall’icona del tipico Peperoncino Messicano, il popolare Red Chilli Pepper che è riuscito ad ispirare anche una famosa band del panorama musicale internazionale. Tra gli altri protagonisti che animano la schermata e le bobine troviamo: il Gallo, una Bottiglia di Tequila, un simpatico signore che indossa il Sombrero in testa e il sole caliente sudamericano, oltre alle carte da poker standard 9, 10, J, Q, K, A. Come per le altre slot del gruppo, disponibili tra l’altro sul nostro sito, ci sono importi di puntata minimi e massimi, in questo caso l’importo di partenza è pari a 0,30€ fino ad un massimo di 75,00€ con un RTP per il giocatore elevato, pari al 95,69%.Se sei un amante della comodità, il pratico pulsante GIOCO AUTOMATICO, che seleziona da 1 fino a 25 giri, fa proprio al caso tuo!\nCi sono altri simboli da non perdere di vista?\n\nIl Messicano coi baffi – Quest’icona rappresenta il Wild, che prende il posto di tutti i simboli quando devi concludere una combinazione vincente, tranne lo Scatter. Il Wild oltre a fungere da Jolly, può formare una propria combinazione nel caso in cui due o più elementi appariranno sulla medesima linea di pagamento.\nLa Borsa con stampa Dollaro – Questo simbolo è lo Scatter del gioco, che fa azionare la funzionalità Bonus Giocate Gratis, non appena tre o più elementi di esso appariranno sparsi sui rulli, facendoti dono di un moltiplicatore X2 della scommessa standard.\n\nFunzionalità extra e Bonus\n\nLa Funzione Puntata che si aziona in seguito ad ogni vincita, è un elemento molto allettante, amato dai giocatori che prediligono un po’ di suspance nel gioco. Se indovini il colore della carta in uscita la tua vincita potrà lievitare raddoppiando o quadruplicando la tua attuale somma. Attenzione! Se non indovini rischi di annullare la tua vincita iniziale.\nIl Bonus Free Spins si attiva non appena 3 o più icone Scatter compaiono in modo sparso sopra i rulli oppure casualmente durante una partita standard. Ci sono due scenari: l’assegnazione di 12 Free Spins oppure, dopo aver selezionato una scommessa extra, i giri diventeranno 15. In ogni caso per ricevere extra jolly e rulli aggiornati dovrai accumulare più simboli Peperoncino.\n\nIl nostro consiglio\nSe ami le slot online colorate e ricche di icone animate e musica allegra, More Chilli ti farà divertire tanto. Puoi gustarla sia in demo che con soldi veri direttamente dal nostro elenco di slot firmate Aristocrat. Che la fiesta cominci!\n",

The Australian software house Aristocrat, which created this online game, wanted to pay homage to this colorful and welcoming country, rich in traditions including spicy and tasty food, using shades of red, yellow, and green to brighten up the game screen, a clear reference to the colors of the national flag.\n\nA hot gameplay with spicy animations!\n\nThe free More Chilli slot, which does not require a download, consists of 5 reels and 25 multicolored paylines, interspersed with the icon of the typical Mexican chili pepper, the popular Red Chilli Pepper that has even inspired a famous band in the international music scene. Among the other protagonists that liven up the screen and the reels we find: the Rooster, a Bottle of Tequila, a funny gentleman wearing a Sombrero on his head and the hot South American sun, as well as the standard poker cards 9, 10, J, Q, K, A. As with the other slots in the group, available on our site, there are minimum and maximum bet amounts, in this case, the starting amount is €0.30 up to a maximum of €75.00 with a high RTP for the player, equal to 95.69%. If you are a lover of convenience, the practical AUTOMATIC GAME button, which selects from 1 up to 25 spins, is just right for you!\n\nAre there any other symbols not to be missed?\n\nThe Mustachioed Mexican - this icon represents the Wild, which takes the place of all symbols when you need to complete a winning combination, except for the Scatter. In addition to acting as a Wild, it can form its own combination in case two or more elements appear on the same payline.\n\nThe Dollar-printed Bag - This symbol is the game's Scatter, which activates the Bonus Free Spins feature as soon as three or more of its elements appear scattered on the reels, giving you a standard bet X2 multiplier.\n\nExtra Features and Bonuses\n\nThe Bet Function that is activated after each win is a very attractive element, loved by players who prefer a bit of suspense in the game. If you guess the color of the card coming out, your win can increase by doubling or quadrupling your current sum. Beware! If you don't guess right, you risk canceling your initial win.\n\nThe Free Spins Bonus is activated as soon as 3 or more Scatter icons appear scattered above the reels or randomly during a standard game. There are two scenarios: an allocation of 12 Free Spins or, after selecting an extra bet, the spins will become 15. In any case, to receive extra Wilds and updated reels, you will need to accumulate more Chili Pepper symbols.\n\nOur advice\n\nIf you love colorful online slots rich in animated icons and cheerful music, More Chilli will give you a lot of fun. You can enjoy it both in demo mode and with real money directly from our list of slots signed by Aristocrat. Let the fiesta begin!\n            ",

The Australian software house Aristocrat, which created this online game, wanted to pay homage to this colorful and welcoming country, rich in traditions including spicy and tasty food, using shades of red, yellow, and green to brighten up the game screen, a clear reference to the colors of the national flag.\n\nA hot gameplay with spicy animations!\n\nThe free More Chilli slot, which does not require a download, consists of 5 reels and 25 multicolored paylines, interspersed with the icon of the typical Mexican chili pepper, the popular Red Chilli Pepper that has even inspired a famous band in the international music scene. Among the other protagonists that liven up the screen and the reels we find: the Rooster, a Bottle of Tequila, a funny gentleman wearing a Sombrero on his head and the hot South American sun, as well as the standard poker cards 9, 10, J, Q, K, A. As with the other slots in the group, available on our site, there are minimum and maximum bet amounts, in this case, the starting amount is €0.30 up to a maximum of €75.00 with a high RTP for the player, equal to 95.69%. If you are a lover of convenience, the practical AUTOMATIC GAME button, which selects from 1 up to 25 spins, is just right for you!\n\nAre there any other symbols not to be missed?\n\nThe Mustachioed Mexican - this icon represents the Wild, which takes the place of all symbols when you need to complete a winning combination, except for the Scatter. In addition to acting as a Wild, it can form its own combination in case two or more elements appear on the same payline.\n\nThe Dollar-printed Bag - This symbol is the game's Scatter, which activates the Bonus Free Spins feature as soon as three or more of its elements appear scattered on the reels, giving you a standard bet X2 multiplier.\n\nExtra Features and Bonuses\n\nThe Bet Function that is activated after each win is a very attractive element, loved by players who prefer a bit of suspense in the game. If you guess the color of the card coming out, your win can increase by doubling or quadrupling your current sum. Beware! If you don't guess right, you risk canceling your initial win.\n\nThe Free Spins Bonus is activated as soon as 3 or more Scatter icons appear scattered above the reels or randomly during a standard game. There are two scenarios: an allocation of 12 Free Spins or, after selecting an extra bet, the spins will become 15. In any case, to receive extra Wilds and updated reels, you will need to accumulate more Chili Pepper symbols.\n\nOur advice\n\nIf you love colorful online slots rich in animated icons and cheerful music, More Chilli will give you a lot of fun. You can enjoy it both in demo mode and with real money directly from our list of slots signed by Aristocrat. Let the fiesta begin!\n            ",
