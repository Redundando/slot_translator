When five of these land on any of the 20 paylines, the prize for a 20.00 euro bet will be 10,000x. Doing some calculations, you'll understand that with 20 euro bets, you can win 200,000! This symbol is followed by the stallion that pays 2,000x on the bet line. These two symbols are the only ones in the game that can pay with only two in view, on a payline.\n\nMoreover, both these highly paying symbols can be replaced by the Wild to make an even more paying combination. The rest of the frame's symbols can pay 500x, 400x, 200x, and so on, for five symbols on a payline.\n\nThe Scatter symbol is the initiator of the free bonus spin feature, and it is also a standalone symbol. Every time it lands on the reels in three or more cases, it not only triggers the free spins but also causes an explosion, leaving an empty space that is filled with a new set of symbols.\n\nLikewise, successive explosions could lead to filling the entire reel set with the dynamite symbols, in which case there is a cash prize of 1000 euros.\n\nThe free spin bonus is familiar to both slot professionals and novices.

When five of these land on any of the 20 paylines, the prize for a 20.00 euro bet will be 10,000x. Doing some calculations, you'll understand that with 20 euro bets, you can win 200,000! This symbol is followed by the stallion that pays 2,000x on the bet line. These two symbols are the only ones in the game that can pay with only two in view, on a payline.\n\nMoreover, both these highly paying symbols can be replaced by the Wild to make an even more paying combination. The rest of the frame's symbols can pay 500x, 400x, 200x, and so on, for five symbols on a payline.\n\nThe Scatter symbol is the initiator of the free bonus spin feature, and it is also a standalone symbol. Every time it lands on the reels in three or more cases, it not only triggers the free spins but also causes an explosion, leaving an empty space that is filled with a new set of symbols.\n\nLikewise, successive explosions could lead to filling the entire reel set with the dynamite symbols, in which case there is a cash prize of 1000 euros.\n\nThe free spin bonus is familiar to both slot professionals and novices. In Gold Canyon's free spins, each additional dynamite landing on the reels will invite another free spin. Therefore, the more you get this symbol, the more free spins you'll have the chance to earn and make real money thanks to luck.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nIf the Gold Canyon online slot has made you want to join the gold rush, you'll find many other wild west-themed games.\n\nWe recommend trying a few spins of NetEnt's Wild Wild West: The Great Train Heist. The difference with this slot is that you have to steal gold rather than find it. Keep an eye out for Scatter trains that trigger free spins with expanding wilds or multiplying wilds.\n            ",

Play on five reels and 20 always-active paylines, with bets starting from a minimum of 0.10 euros per spin and reaching a maximum of 20.00 euros. The game features a free spin bonus, along with the dynamite explosion feature, which offers the chance to win a 1000x prize. The game’s most lucrative symbol pays 10,000x for five of these identical symbols on a line, at the maximum bet.\n\nIt’s not easy to navigate the thousands of excellent online slots to choose from, but all the budding prospectors will love the chance to play the Gold Canyon slot machine by Betsoft.\n\nA bit of fun is provided by the cowboy symbols that serve as the Expanding Wilds, which can replace other symbols within a payline. There are also highly rewarding gold nuggets, while scattered clusters of dynamite reward big wins and free spins. Keep reading our Gold Canyon slot review for more important information!\n\nWild West Graphics\n\nThe Gold Canyon slot seems to have everything it takes when it comes to potential winnings and the excitement of a serious slot game. This slot machine has an above-average theoretical return to player rate, with 20 always-active paylines and a possible maximum win of 4,774x multiplied by the bet.\n\nThe adventure begins on horseback, on the edge of a vast frontier. The goal is to get as many winning combinations as possible during the game, and this can go on depending on your bankroll, i.e., your initial budget with which you start betting. By pressing the Play button, the reels begin to spin and retrieve a series of symbols.\n\nThe Poker cards that start from 10 and end with the Ace, designed as if coated in iron, are the lower-value symbols, important for maintaining balance, while the images are those symbols that can lead to some nice wins.\n\nThe Gold Canyon slot machine is available on mobile, tablet, and desktop, so it’s easy to go to the wild west wherever you are. Strangely for the software provider Betsoft, the graphics are only in 2D, but provide an excellent setting. The graphics also go hand in hand with the audio to give the game a relaxing atmosphere.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\n\nA look at the payout symbol is given within the paytable, which is a source of information on bonus features, general game rules, and a few other things. Although it's not necessary to browse what's in the paytable, it can be useful to take a look just to know how much each symbol can pay for each winning instance. To access the paytable, select the menu button at the bottom left of the page.\n\nThe most valuable symbol in the Gold Canyon slot is the gold nugget.

This slot machine has an above-average theoretical return to player rate, with 20 always-active paylines and a possible maximum win of 4,774x multiplied by the bet.\n\nThe adventure begins on horseback, on the edge of a vast frontier. The goal is to get as many winning combinations as possible during the game, and this can go on depending on your bankroll, i.e., your initial budget with which you start betting. By pressing the Play button, the reels begin to spin and retrieve a series of symbols.\n\nThe Poker cards that start from 10 and end with the Ace, designed as if coated in iron, are the lower-value symbols, important for maintaining balance, while the images are those symbols that can lead to some nice wins.\n\nThe Gold Canyon slot machine is available on mobile, tablet, and desktop, so it’s easy to go to the wild west wherever you are. Strangely for the software provider Betsoft, the graphics are only in 2D, but provide an excellent setting. The graphics also go hand in hand with the audio to give the game a relaxing atmosphere.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\n\nA look at the payout symbol is given within the paytable, which is a source of information on bonus features, general game rules, and a few other things. Although it's not necessary to browse what's in the paytable, it can be useful to take a look just to know how much each symbol can pay for each winning instance. To access the paytable, select the menu button at the bottom left of the page.\n\nThe most valuable symbol in the Gold Canyon slot is the gold nugget. When five of these land on any of the 20 paylines, the prize for a 20.00 euro bet will be 10,000x. Doing some calculations, you'll understand that with 20 euro bets, you can win 200,000! This symbol is followed by the stallion that pays 2,000x on the bet line. These two symbols are the only ones in the game that can pay with only two in view, on a payline.\n\nMoreover, both these highly paying symbols can be replaced by the Wild to make an even more paying combination. The rest of the frame's symbols can pay 500x, 400x, 200x, and so on, for five symbols on a payline.\n\nThe Scatter symbol is the initiator of the free bonus spin feature, and it is also a standalone symbol. Every time it lands on the reels in three or more cases, it not only triggers the free spins but also causes an explosion, leaving an empty space that is filled with a new set of symbols.\n\nLikewise, successive explosions could lead to filling the entire reel set with the dynamite symbols, in which case there is a cash prize of 1000 euros.\n\nThe free spin bonus is familiar to both slot professionals and novices. In Gold Canyon's free spins, each additional dynamite landing on the reels will invite another free spin. Therefore, the more you get this symbol, the more free spins you'll have the chance to earn and make real money thanks to luck.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nIf the Gold Canyon online slot has made you want to join the gold rush, you'll find many other wild west-themed games.\n\nWe recommend trying a few spins of NetEnt's Wild Wild West: The Great Train Heist. The difference with this slot is that you have to steal gold rather than find it. Keep an eye out for Scatter trains that trigger free spins with expanding wilds or multiplying wilds.\n            ",
