E questo lo sa bene Reel Kingdom, che ha deciso di puntare proprio sulle slot del passato realizzando la sua Hot to Burn Extreme. Non ti aspettare quindi grandissimi colpi di scena, perché lo scopo è quello di rispolverare la bellezza delle slot originali. La macchinetta infatti viene equipaggiata di un round bonus con Free Spin e simpatiche ma semplicissime animazioni. In totale poi permette di offrire un potenziale di vincita fino a 5.000 volte la puntata. Il suo RTP è impostato al 96,65% che è indubbiamente un valore in linea con la media del mercato. Ma scopriamo di più in merito a questa slot!\nGrafica e caratteristiche della slot \nNonostante il layout tipico delle slot di un tempo, su Hot to Burn Extreme la griglia è leggermente più grande, con 4 righe e 5 rulli per un totale di 40 linee di pagamento disponibili. Il giocatore dovrà combinare 3 o più simboli simili per poter poi incassare le sue vincite. E visto che parliamo di stile retrò, quali potevano essere le icone principali se non la frutta? Devi sapere che le Fruit Slot hanno segnato un’epoca importante per questo gioco d’azzardo, non solo online ma soprattutto nelle versioni terrestri.\nInoltre il gioco combina una colonna sonora techno e una grafica davvero ben realizzata. Preparati a veder scendere sulla griglia limoni, arance, prugne, fragole, il numero 7 e le immancabili ciliegie. Ma ovviamente non poteva essere lasciato da parte il personaggio del jolly e una stella d’oro che è lo scatter utile per attivare il round bonus.\nBonus game e funzionalità \nCome abbiamo detto non ci sono molte funzionalità, ma la funzione dei giri gratuiti può permettere di vincere delle somme di denaro davvero interessanti. Considera quindi che l’atterraggio simultaneo di 3, 4 o 5 simboli Scatter ti farà accedere al bonus e ti offrirà 10, 15 o 20 giri gratuiti. Si potrà poi riattivare senza alcun limite.\nNel complesso la slot è piacevole, anche se di “extreme” c’è ben poco, se non la voglia di far tornare in auge un tipo di slot che ormai sembra essere ben lontana dalla modernità.\n\nFAQ: Le risposte alle domande più frequenti \nSi può giocare gratis alla slot Hot to Burn Extreme?\n\nSì, alcuni casinò offrono la versione demo e For Fun, ma ci sono anche versioni gratuite nei siti e portali di appassionati sicuri e affidabili.\n\n\n\nLa slot è adatta per la versione mobile?\n\nSì, il provider ha lavorato per garantire divertimento e scommesse da qualsiasi dispositivo e non solo da pc.\n\n\n\nIl suo RTP è buono?\n\nSì, ha un buon ritorno al giocatore che si assesta nella media con il 96,65%.\n\n\n\n",

And Reel Kingdom knows this well, choosing to focus on the slots of the past with their Hot to Burn Extreme. Don't expect any major surprises, because the goal is to revive the beauty of the original slots. This machine is equipped with a bonus round with Free Spins and cute but simple animations, offering a potential winning payout of up to 5,000 times the bet. Its RTP is set at 96.65%, which is undoubtedly in line with the industry average. Let's take a closer look at this slot!\n\nGraphics and Features\nDespite the typical layout of older slots, on Hot to Burn Extreme the grid is slightly larger, with 4 rows and 5 reels providing a total of 40 paylines. Players must match 3 or more similar symbols to win their payout. And since we're talking retro style, what could be the main icons other than fruit? You have to know that Fruit Slots have marked an important era for this gambling game, not only online but especially in land-based versions. In addition, the game combines techno music and well-crafted graphics, with lemons, oranges, plums, strawberries, the number 7, and the inevitable cherries falling onto the reels. But of course, the wild character couldn't be left out, nor the golden star, which acts as the scatter symbol to activate the bonus round.\n\nBonus game and features\nAs we said, there aren't many features, but the free spins feature can allow you to win some really interesting sums of money. Keep in mind that landing 3, 4, or 5 Scatter symbols simultaneously will grant you access to the bonus round, offering you 10, 15, or 20 free spins respectively, and can be retriggered indefinitely.\n\nOverall, the slot is pleasant, although there is very little \"extreme\" about it, other than the desire to bring back a type of slot that seems to be far from modern.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\nCan you play Hot to Burn Extreme for free?\n\nYes, some casinos offer a demo and For Fun version, but there are also free versions available on safe and reliable enthusiast sites and portals.\n\nIs the slot suitable for mobile devices?\n\nYes, the provider has worked to ensure fun and betting from any device, not just from PC.\n\nIs its RTP good?\n\nYes, it has a good return to player rate that falls within the industry average at 96.65%.",

And Reel Kingdom knows this well, which is why they've focused on classic slots with Hot to Burn Extreme. Don't expect anything too dramatic, as the goal is simply to bring back the beauty of old school slots. The machine is equipped with a Free Spin bonus round and charming yet simple animations. It also offers a potential payout of up to 5,000 times your bet. Its RTP is set to 96.65%, which is undoubtedly a value in line with the market average. But let's learn more about this slot!\n\nGraphics and features of the slot\nDespite the typical layout of slots from the past, Hot to Burn Extreme has a slightly larger grid, with 4 rows and 5 reels for a total of 40 paylines available. The player must combine 3 or more similar symbols to then cash in their winnings. And since we're talking about retro style, what could be the main icons if not fruit? The Fruit Slots have marked an important era for this type of gambling game, not only online but especially in land-based versions.\n\nThe game also features a techno soundtrack and truly well-made graphics. Get ready to see lemons, oranges, plums, strawberries, the number 7, and the inevitable cherries on the grid. But if course, the jolly character and a gold star that serves as the scatter to activate the bonus round couldn't be neglected.\n\nBonus game and features\nAs we said, there aren't many features, but the free spins function can allow you to win some really interesting sums of money. So keep in mind that the simultaneous landing of 3, 4, or 5 Scatter symbols will give you access to the bonus and offer you 10, 15, or 20 free spins. And you can reactivate without any limit.\n\nOverall, the slot is pleasant, though there's little \"extreme\" about it, other than a desire to bring back the original charm of slots that now seem far from modernity.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\nCan you play Hot to Burn Extreme slot for free?\nYes, some casinos offer the demo version and play for fun, but there are also free versions on safe and reliable enthusiast sites and portals.\n\nIs the slot suitable for the mobile version?\nYes, the provider has worked to ensure fun and betting from any device, not just from a PC.\n\nIs its RTP good?\nYes, its return to player percentage is good and in line with the market average at 96.65%.\n            ",

And Reel Kingdom knows this well, which is why they've focused on classic slots with Hot to Burn Extreme. Don't expect anything too dramatic, as the goal is simply to bring back the beauty of old school slots. The machine is equipped with a Free Spin bonus round and charming yet simple animations. It also offers a potential payout of up to 5,000 times your bet. Its RTP is set to 96.65%, which is undoubtedly a value in line with the market average. But let's learn more about this slot!\n\nGraphics and features of the slot\nDespite the typical layout of slots from the past, Hot to Burn Extreme has a slightly larger grid, with 4 rows and 5 reels for a total of 40 paylines available. The player must combine 3 or more similar symbols to then cash in their winnings. And since we're talking about retro style, what could be the main icons if not fruit? The Fruit Slots have marked an important era for this type of gambling game, not only online but especially in land-based versions.\n\nThe game also features a techno soundtrack and truly well-made graphics. Get ready to see lemons, oranges, plums, strawberries, the number 7, and the inevitable cherries on the grid. But if course, the jolly character and a gold star that serves as the scatter to activate the bonus round couldn't be neglected.\n\nBonus game and features\nAs we said, there aren't many features, but the free spins function can allow you to win some really interesting sums of money. So keep in mind that the simultaneous landing of 3, 4, or 5 Scatter symbols will give you access to the bonus and offer you 10, 15, or 20 free spins. And you can reactivate without any limit.\n\nOverall, the slot is pleasant, though there's little \"extreme\" about it, other than a desire to bring back the original charm of slots that now seem far from modernity.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\nCan you play Hot to Burn Extreme slot for free?\nYes, some casinos offer the demo version and play for fun, but there are also free versions on safe and reliable enthusiast sites and portals.\n\nIs the slot suitable for the mobile version?\nYes, the provider has worked to ensure fun and betting from any device, not just from a PC.\n\nIs its RTP good?\nYes, its return to player percentage is good and in line with the market average at 96.65%.\n            ",
