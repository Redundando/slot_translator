Creatures depicted in many different ways: powerful enemies or wise allies.\nBut dragons are also the guardians of ancient and precious treasures, and there are many stories of heroes who fight against them to obtain the coveted wealth.\nAnd one could say that even in the slot game Dragon Egg by Tom Horn, players will face dragons guarding treasures and riches. In this review, we will not only examine the technical aspects of this slot, but also its graphic and sound components.\nDragon Egg - Graphics\nSet in the darkness of a cave, the slot immediately presents itself in its simplicity and immediacy.\nIn fact, the game grid has very few frills and reproduces the background graphics with rocky details. The absence of colors outside of the various shades of gray may make this slot rather gloomy, but the special symbols add the touch of color needed.\nThe symbols are, of course, dragons. These are differentiated more by the color of their element, such as green for earth or red for fire, rather than a simple design that does not stand out for variety.\nThe WILD and SCATTER symbols are respectively a black dragon and a golden dragon egg. These are also easily recognizable illustrations. In the grid, we will also find the classic card symbols (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9) carved in stone.\nThe spins are accompanied by music reminiscent of Far Eastern sounds, made up of flutes and drums. Perfectly in line with the setting. The sounds, on the other hand, are rather standard.\nDragon Egg is a slot that aims for simplicity rather than filling the game grid with too many details that could distract or confuse the gameplay.\nLet's move on to the technical part.\nDragon Egg - What to expect from the game\nStarting with the most basic aspects, we are faced with the typical Tom Horn slot: a 5*3 game grid that shows fifteen symbols at each spin and the 9 paylines that announce few wins but slightly higher values than average.\nAmong the symbols we find on the game grid, we remember the black dragon (in full figure), which plays the role of Wild capable of replacing any other symbol in the game (except the Scatter, which we will talk about shortly).\nThe second symbol is precisely the dragon egg that gives this slot its name: it is a Scatter symbol that allows access to the free spins mode, finding at least three in a single spin.\nThis is the feature that naturally generates the most interest and is particularly difficult to trigger (at least in our direct experience). In fact, even though we found the eggs many times during our spins, it took about two hundred spins to trigger the bonus mode.\nThat said, the winnings obtained during these spins made it possible to keep the game account quite stable even during this long wait, with a couple of significant wins that made the game exciting.\nSlots similar to Dragon Egg\nThe dragon, due to its association with the theme of wealth, is one of the most used animals in slots. We can find Dragon Riches, Dragon's Inferno, 5 Dragons, and many others.\n            ",

The black dragon serves as the WILD symbol, fully replacing any other symbol except for the golden dragon egg, which is the SCATTER symbol and triggers the free spins mode when three or more appear in a single spin.\n\nTheme and graphics\n\nDragon Egg is set in a cave, with the game grid featuring mainly shades of gray, though the dragon symbols add a touch of color. The graphics are simple and immediate, with a focus on presenting a clear and concise picture. The dragon symbol designs don't stand out for their variety, but they're recognizable. The slot's simplicity aims to avoid confusion and distraction.\n\nSound and music\n\nThe background music for Dragon Egg is reminiscent of Far Eastern sounds, featuring flutes and drums that fit perfectly with the game's setting. The sounds are standard, and there are no notable features.\n\nBonus features (free spins mode)\n\nThe free spins mode in Dragon Egg is triggered by landing three or more golden dragon egg symbols on a single spin. It's difficult to trigger this feature, but the winnings obtained during these spins are potentially substantial and can make the long wait exciting. During the free spins mode, the payout values increase, creating an opportunity for players to make significant wins.\n\nSimilar slots with dragon themes\n\nThe dragon theme is a popular one in the world of online slots. There are many others available, such as Dragon Riches, Dragon's Inferno, and 5 Dragons. Each of these slots offers unique gameplay mechanics and distinguished graphics, so it's worth trying them out to find your favorite among the lot.\n\n        \n            ",

In this review, we will not only examine the technical aspects of this slot, but also its graphic and sound components.\nDragon Egg - Graphics\nSet in the darkness of a cave, the slot immediately presents itself in its simplicity and immediacy.\nIn fact, the game grid has very few frills and reproduces the background graphics with rocky details. The absence of colors outside of the various shades of gray may make this slot rather gloomy, but the special symbols add the touch of color needed.\nThe symbols are, of course, dragons. These are differentiated more by the color of their element, such as green for earth or red for fire, rather than a simple design that does not stand out for variety.\nThe WILD and SCATTER symbols are respectively a black dragon and a golden dragon egg. These are also easily recognizable illustrations. In the grid, we will also find the classic card symbols (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9) carved in stone.\nThe spins are accompanied by music reminiscent of Far Eastern sounds, made up of flutes and drums. Perfectly in line with the setting. The sounds, on the other hand, are rather standard.\nDragon Egg is a slot that aims for simplicity rather than filling the game grid with too many details that could distract or confuse the gameplay.\nLet's move on to the technical part.\nDragon Egg - What to expect from the game\nStarting with the most basic aspects, we are faced with the typical Tom Horn slot: a 5*3 game grid that shows fifteen symbols at each spin and the 9 paylines that announce few wins but slightly higher values than average.\nAmong the symbols we find on the game grid, we remember the black dragon (in full figure), which plays the role of Wild capable of replacing any other symbol in the game (except the Scatter, which we will talk about shortly).\nThe second symbol is precisely the dragon egg that gives this slot its name: it is a Scatter symbol that allows access to the free spins mode, finding at least three in a single spin.\nThis is the feature that naturally generates the most interest and is particularly difficult to trigger (at least in our direct experience). In fact, even though we found the eggs many times during our spins, it took about two hundred spins to trigger the bonus mode.\nThat said, the winnings obtained during these spins made it possible to keep the game account quite stable even during this long wait, with a couple of significant wins that made the game exciting.\nSlots similar to Dragon Egg\nThe dragon, due to its association with the theme of wealth, is one of the most used animals in slots. We can find Dragon Riches, Dragon's Inferno, 5 Dragons, and many others.\n            ",

Creatures depicted in many different ways: powerful enemies or wise allies.\nBut dragons are also the guardians of ancient and precious treasures, and there are many stories of heroes who fight against them to obtain the coveted wealth.\nAnd one could say that even in the slot game Dragon Egg by Tom Horn, players will face dragons guarding treasures and riches. In this review, we will not only examine the technical aspects of this slot, but also its graphic and sound components.\nDragon Egg - Graphics\nSet in the darkness of a cave, the slot immediately presents itself in its simplicity and immediacy.\nIn fact, the game grid has very few frills and reproduces the background graphics with rocky details. The absence of colors outside of the various shades of gray may make this slot rather gloomy, but the special symbols add the touch of color needed.\nThe symbols are, of course, dragons. These are differentiated more by the color of their element, such as green for earth or red for fire, rather than a simple design that does not stand out for variety.\nThe WILD and SCATTER symbols are respectively a black dragon and a golden dragon egg. These are also easily recognizable illustrations. In the grid, we will also find the classic card symbols (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9) carved in stone.\nThe spins are accompanied by music reminiscent of Far Eastern sounds, made up of flutes and drums. Perfectly in line with the setting. The sounds, on the other hand, are rather standard.\nDragon Egg is a slot that aims for simplicity rather than filling the game grid with too many details that could distract or confuse the gameplay.\nLet's move on to the technical part.\nDragon Egg - What to expect from the game\nStarting with the most basic aspects, we are faced with the typical Tom Horn slot: a 5*3 game grid that shows fifteen symbols at each spin and the 9 paylines that announce few wins but slightly higher values than average.\nAmong the symbols we find on the game grid, we remember the black dragon (in full figure), which plays the role of Wild capable of replacing any other symbol in the game (except the Scatter, which we will talk about shortly).\nThe second symbol is precisely the dragon egg that gives this slot its name: it is a Scatter symbol that allows access to the free spins mode, finding at least three in a single spin.\nThis is the feature that naturally generates the most interest and is particularly difficult to trigger (at least in our direct experience).
