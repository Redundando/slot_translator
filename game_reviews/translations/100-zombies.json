Tra declinazioni cinematografiche, serie tv, libri e fumetti, possiamo dire che questo tema sia entrato a tutti gli effetti nell’immaginario di milioni di persone sparse per il mondo. Lo spunto da cui si parte è più o meno lo stesso: un virus misterioso viene rilasciato per errore durante un esperimento e in men che non si dica milioni di persone vengono infettate. Le persone muoiono per poi risvegliarsi con la mente resettata ma con un impulso a nutrirsi di carne umana viva. Il successivo contatto tra non morti e esseri umani trasforma quest’ultimi in zombie, dando così vita a un’epidemia su larga scala. Di solito c’è sempre un gruppo di sopravvissuti tra cui lo scienziato alla ricerca di un antidoto che metta fine al contagio. In 100 Zombies sono presenti tutti questi elementi. Per rendere la slot accattivante, gli sviluppatori della Endorphina hanno lavorato molto sul comparto grafico, che appare ottimamente dettagliato e con alcune animazioni di assoluto rispetto. La griglia di gioco si staglia su una città invasa dalle fiamme su cui si espandono nubi vedi, a sottolineare ancor di più un ambiente malsano. Una musica cadenzata simile a quella dei film west ci accompagna durante tutta l’avventura.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa Endorphina ha deciso di puntare su una classica slot a 5 rulli e 4 righe, con 100 paylines variabili, cioè possiamo decidere noi quante attivarne. Il numero minimo di linee su cui è possibile giocare è 20. Per quel che riguarda il costo di ciascun spin, si parte da 0,01 € per linea fino a un massimo di 100 €. Per chi volesse, è possibile giocare con l’Autoplay e oltre al numero di giri automatici, impostare anche alcuni limiti di tempo o di vincita. 100 Zombie ha un RTP del 96%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nI simboli con minor valore sono quelli delle carte da gioco dal J all’asso. Subito dopo in termini di ricompensa troviamo il poliziotto zombie, il cacciatore armato di fucile, l’infermiera sempre in versione non morta e la ragazza con la pistola. A seguire c’è lo studente zombie e l’uomo con la mazza chiodata. La scritta Wild è il nostro Jolly, sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter, inoltre è pagante. I simboli Wild spesso appaiono impilati. Il simbolo Biotech è il nostro Scatter e ne bastano 3 per vederci ricompensati con 10 giri gratuiti, durante i quali i Wild impilati possono comparire soltanto sui rulli 2, 3 e 4. Se durante i Free Spins appaiono altri 3 simboli Scatter, riceveremo 10 giri gratuiti aggiuntivi. In 100 Zombies è presente anche la funzione Gamble per provare a far lievitare le nostre vincite.\n",

These adorable undead creatures with a particular appetite for human flesh have become an integral part of the imagination of millions of people around the world through movies, TV series, books, and comics. The starting point is more or less the same for all: a mysterious virus is accidentally released during an experiment, infecting millions of people who die and then reawaken with a reset mind, but with an impulse to feed on live human flesh. The subsequent contact between the undead and humans transforms the latter into zombies, giving rise to a large-scale epidemic. Usually, there is always a group of survivors, including a scientist searching for an antidote to end the contagion. In 100 Zombies, all of these elements merge into a slot game. To make the game appealing, Endorphina's developers have worked hard on the graphic component, which appears excellently detailed with some animations of absolute respect.

These adorable undead creatures with a particular appetite for human flesh have become an integral part of the imagination of millions of people around the world through movies, TV series, books, and comics. The starting point is more or less the same for all: a mysterious virus is accidentally released during an experiment, infecting millions of people who die and then reawaken with a reset mind, but with an impulse to feed on live human flesh. The subsequent contact between the undead and humans transforms the latter into zombies, giving rise to a large-scale epidemic. Usually, there is always a group of survivors, including a scientist searching for an antidote to end the contagion. In 100 Zombies, all of these elements merge into a slot game. To make the game appealing, Endorphina's developers have worked hard on the graphic component, which appears excellently detailed with some animations of absolute respect. The game grid stands out in a city engulfed in flames with expanding clouds, emphasizing even more the unhealthy environment.

However, what makes it so exciting is the fact that there are 100 variable paylines to choose from, which allows players to decide how many to activate. The game's minimum number of activated paylines is 20. It is also noteworthy that the cost of each spin ranges from €0.01 per line to €100. Furthermore, players can try out Autoplay. The game's RTP is 96%.\n\nDesign and Graphics\n\nThe developers of Endorphina have done an excellent job with the graphic component of 100 Zombies. The game's design and graphics are outstanding, and the attention to detail is remarkable. The game grid is set in a city that is on fire, which gives the game an exciting and mysterious feel. The animations are top-notch, and the music that accompanies the game is rhythmic and thrilling, similar to that of western movies.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nThe symbols in 100 Zombies are a mix of classic and unique, with a range of features to offer the players. The symbols with the lowest value are the playing cards, from J to Ace. After that, we find the zombie policeman, the rifle-armed hunter, the nurse who is undead, and the girl who has a pistol. Afterward, we have the zombie student and the man with the nail-studded club, which have higher rewards. The Wild symbol is a wild card that replaces all symbols except the Scatter and is also paying. Wild symbols appear stacked quite often. The Biotech symbol is the Scatter, and three of them reward players with ten free spins. During free spins, stacked wilds can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. If three more Scatter symbols appear during the Free Spins, players receive an additional ten free spins.\n\nFree Spins and Scatters\n\nThe Biotech symbol serves as the Scatter symbol in 100 Zombies, and players need a minimum of three to reward them with ten free spins. During free spins, the stacked wilds only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. If three more Scatter symbols show up during free spins, players receive an additional ten free spins. This feature can significantly increase players' chances of winning big in the game. \n\nGamble Feature\n\nEndorphina has added a Gamble feature in 100 Zombies to enable players to try and boost their winnings. The feature is quite simple as players have to pick the higher card between theirs and the dealer's to increase their winnings significantly. However, players should be aware that the gamble feature doesn't guarantee winning, and they could end up losing their earnings.\n\n        \n            ",

These adorable undead creatures with a particular appetite for human flesh have become an integral part of the imagination of millions of people around the world through movies, TV series, books, and comics. The starting point is more or less the same for all: a mysterious virus is accidentally released during an experiment, infecting millions of people who die and then reawaken with a reset mind, but with an impulse to feed on live human flesh. The subsequent contact between the undead and humans transforms the latter into zombies, giving rise to a large-scale epidemic. Usually, there is always a group of survivors, including a scientist searching for an antidote to end the contagion. In 100 Zombies, all of these elements merge into a slot game. To make the game appealing, Endorphina's developers have worked hard on the graphic component, which appears excellently detailed with some animations of absolute respect. The game grid stands out in a city engulfed in flames with expanding clouds, emphasizing even more the unhealthy environment. A rhythmic music similar to that of western movies accompanies us throughout the adventure.\n\nSlot Features:\nEndorphina has chosen to focus on a classic five-reel and four-row slot with 100 variable paylines, meaning we can decide how many to activate. The minimum number of lines we can play on is 20. As for the cost of each spin, we start from €0.01 per line up to a maximum of €100. For those who'd like, it is possible to play with Autoplay and, in addition to the number of automatic spins, set some time or win limits. 100 Zombies has an RTP of 96%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\nThe symbols with the lowest value are the playing cards, from J to Ace. Immediately after in terms of reward, we find the zombie policeman, the rifle-armed hunter, the nurse always in undead version, and the girl with the pistol. Following are the zombie student and the man with the nail-studded club. The Wild sign is our wild card, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, and is also paying. Wild symbols appear stacked quite often. The Biotech symbol is our scatter and three of them are enough to reward us with ten free spins, during which stacked wilds can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. If three more Scatter symbols appear during the Free Spins, we'll receive an additional ten free spins. In 100 Zombies, there is also the Gamble feature to try and boost our winnings.\n            ",

These adorable undead creatures with a particular appetite for human flesh have become an integral part of the imagination of millions of people around the world through movies, TV series, books, and comics. The starting point is more or less the same for all: a mysterious virus is accidentally released during an experiment, infecting millions of people who die and then reawaken with a reset mind, but with an impulse to feed on live human flesh. The subsequent contact between the undead and humans transforms the latter into zombies, giving rise to a large-scale epidemic. Usually, there is always a group of survivors, including a scientist searching for an antidote to end the contagion. In 100 Zombies, all of these elements merge into a slot game. To make the game appealing, Endorphina's developers have worked hard on the graphic component, which appears excellently detailed with some animations of absolute respect. The game grid stands out in a city engulfed in flames with expanding clouds, emphasizing even more the unhealthy environment. A rhythmic music similar to that of western movies accompanies us throughout the adventure.\n\nSlot Features:\nEndorphina has chosen to focus on a classic five-reel and four-row slot with 100 variable paylines, meaning we can decide how many to activate. The minimum number of lines we can play on is 20. As for the cost of each spin, we start from €0.01 per line up to a maximum of €100. For those who'd like, it is possible to play with Autoplay and, in addition to the number of automatic spins, set some time or win limits. 100 Zombies has an RTP of 96%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\nThe symbols with the lowest value are the playing cards, from J to Ace. Immediately after in terms of reward, we find the zombie policeman, the rifle-armed hunter, the nurse always in undead version, and the girl with the pistol. Following are the zombie student and the man with the nail-studded club. The Wild sign is our wild card, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, and is also paying. Wild symbols appear stacked quite often. The Biotech symbol is our scatter and three of them are enough to reward us with ten free spins, during which stacked wilds can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. If three more Scatter symbols appear during the Free Spins, we'll receive an additional ten free spins. In 100 Zombies, there is also the Gamble feature to try and boost our winnings.\n            ",
