Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and Mechanics\n\nGreta Goes Wild is a classic slot game with 5 reels and 3 rows. It features 10 fixed pay lines and the minimum bet is 0.01€ on each line. The maximum total bet is 30€ and the automatic spins can vary between 10 and 100. With high volatility and an RTP of 96%, Greta Goes Wild offers high chances of winning, up to 8,000€ per bet.\n\nGame Symbols and Payouts\n\nThe symbols in Greta Goes Wild range from 9 to Ace cards which pay the least. Assuming a minimum bet, seeing five 9s or 10s appear will win 0.20€, with the same number of Js and Qs we get to 0.30€, the K, and Ace 0.40€. Thematic symbols, such as pretzels, hats, barrels, and inn customers offer good winnings, as does the game logo. However, the highest payout is offered by Greta herself, who is also the Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter (represented by a Bavarian beer mug).\n\nSpecial Features and Bonuses\n\nGreta Goes Wild offers special features and bonuses that enhance the gameplay experience. Landing on 3 Scatter symbols awards 10 free spins, and up to 15 free spins can be achieved with 5 Scatters. During free spins, the Wild symbols remain locked on the reels and are associated with a 2x or 3x multiplier. Greta can also randomly award mega wins or bonuses during regular spins, while during free spins, she rewards players with an additional spin upon appearing.\n\nGraphics and Sound Design\n\nGreta Goes Wild has top-notch graphics and design that evoke a festive Oktoberfest atmosphere. The reels spin against a background of a pub setting, complete with barrels of beer and frothy glasses resting on the counter. The accompanying music of the place enhances the jovial atmosphere, with a change in music during free spins adding to the excitement.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nGreta Goes Wild has high volatility and an RTP of 96%. This means that players have high chances of winning up to 8,000€ per bet. The minimum bet is very reasonable, at 0.01€ on each line. With a classic game grid of 5 reels and 3 rows, this slot game is a great option for those who prefer a more traditional gameplay experience.\n\n        \n            ",

The background on which the reels move is Greta's inn, with barrels of beer on full display and a few frothy glasses resting on the counter. On the right, we find only a few buttons, just the one for Start and for automatic spins, as well as one to access the settings. A typical jovial music of the place accompanies each rotation of the reels, increasing the festive atmosphere that is felt during the game.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nFor Greta Goes Wild, they decided to focus on a classic game grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. There are 10 fixed pay lines, and the minimum bet is very reasonable at 0.01€ on each line, so every spin will cost only 0.10€. The maximum total bet is 30€. The automatic spins can vary between 10 and 100. High volatility and an RTP of 96% make Greta Goes Wild an excellent slot with high chances of winning, up to 8,000€ per bet!\n\nSymbols and features of Greta Goes Wild\n\nCards from 9 to Ace are the symbols that pay the least. Assuming a minimum bet, therefore, equal to 0.10€, seeing five 9s or 10s appear will win 0.20€, with the same number of Js and Qs we get to 0.30€, the K, and Ace 0.40€. With the thematic symbols, the music starts to change: pretzels, hats, barrels, and inn customers offer good winnings, as does the game logo.\n\nA great win is instead offered by Greta in person, who also has the function of Wild, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the typical Bavarian beer mug. Based on the number of symbols landed on the reels, we can receive between 10 and 15 free spins, during which the Wild symbols will remain locked on the reels. But these are not ordinary Wilds, in fact, they are associated with a 2x or 3x multiplier. If 2 or 3 Wilds appear next to each other, then the winnings will be multiplied by 2 or 3. During regular spins, Greta can peek at the reels and give us a mega win that can exceed 25X or offer us a bonus. If she appears during Free Spins, we will be rewarded with a new free spin.\n        ",
