With the same structure as its predecessor, Back to Venus makes it seem like aliens have invaded a farm, and gamers can enjoy this abduction through its high-quality design and graphics. As a five-reel, three-row, and 25-payline game, Back to Venus offers a couple of interesting bonus features, including wild and scatter symbols.\n\nThe game is set on a farm where a space carnivorous plant is on the hunt for a farmer. Back to Venus is a farm-style game similar to its predecessor. It will be available to play on all desktop and mobile devices.\n\nWhen it comes to BetSoft, the games they present are always advertised before release. Recently, the company has been revisiting some of its latest successes and adapting them to meet the modern demands of gambling. BetSoft is also expanding its reach into the Latin American market.\n\nExtraterrestrial Design\nBack to Venus slot game joins BetSoft's collection of newly released slots in 2020, and in this review, we'll go over the essential things you need to know about it. If this game seems familiar to you, you're not mistaken. Back to Venus is a new version of the slot game, It Came From Venus, with the same theme. This time, BetSoft's team returns with the same story, but with more attractive features and functions.\n\nBack to Venus is a video slot game with five reels and 25 paylines. It will be released in April 2020, so we don't have all the details yet. As far as we know, Back to Venus will offer wild and scatter symbols, as well as free spins. The range of bets is still unknown, as is the RTP. However, the game's predecessor, \"It Came From Venus,\" has an RTP of 95.80%, and bets range from €0.02 to €75, so we expect Back to Venus to have similar numbers.\n\nWe'll update the review of the Back to Venus slot with the correct information, so be sure to check back for more details.\n\nIn terms of design, Back to Venus is very similar to the previous version. However, it has high-quality design and graphics, just like the 2012 version, which is a testament to its quality. Back to Venus offers advanced graphics that create a cartoon-like atmosphere. As mentioned earlier, space carnivorous plants are the center of this game. As for the symbols, you have low-cost poker playing cards, as well as the farmer, the transformed astronaut, alien plants, barns, UFO rockets, and fields.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nThe game starts with the pressing of a round light green button located beneath the reels. This is the spin button that you need to press when you're ready to start playing. However, before that, you need to place your spin bet, which can be done by pressing the plus and minus buttons next to the spin button. Currently, we don't know how the bet will end up, so we'll update this review once we know.\n\nThere's an \"Autoplay\" button next to the \"Spin\" button that allows you to make automatic spins without having to press the spin button each time. Feel free to activate it if you want to enjoy this game hands-free.\n\nOne of the features that will be included in this game is the wild symbol that has its own logo and will behave like a typical substitute. It will replace all regular symbols except for scatters. Additionally, there's a Bonus Round symbol that will likely reward players with free spins. For now, we don't have any further details about the game's bonus features, but we'll update this review once we know more.\n\nTo win cash rewards, you need to land at least three matching symbols on a single payline, starting from the leftmost reel. As we currently know, there are 25 paylines in total in this game, which means that there are 25 winning combinations for cash reward scores. Also, wild and scatter symbols are here to increase your wins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIt Came From Venus revolves around the story of Skeeter, a simple farmer who lives on his farm and encounters aliens on his land. This is a 5-reel, 30-payline Betsoft Gaming video slot game with many rewards, surprises, and, of course, fantastic bonus features, with a rather exciting and advanced gameplay.\n\nThis online slot game has some amazing bonus features that could lead to lucrative rewards. The random game will trigger a multiplier from x2 up to x10.\n\nIn the so-called Feed Me bonus feature, landing three stacked food symbols will reward you with 11 free spins."

As a five-reel, three-row, and 25-payline game, Back to Venus offers a couple of interesting bonus features, including wild and scatter symbols.\n\nThe game is set on a farm where a space carnivorous plant is on the hunt for a farmer. Back to Venus is a farm-style game similar to its predecessor. It will be available to play on all desktop and mobile devices.\n\nWhen it comes to BetSoft, the games they present are always advertised before release.

It will be released in April 2020, so we don't have all the details yet. As far as we know, Back to Venus will offer wild and scatter symbols, as well as free spins. The range of bets is still unknown, as is the RTP. However, the game's predecessor, \"It Came From Venus,\" has an RTP of 95.80%, and bets range from €0.02 to €75, so we expect Back to Venus to have similar numbers.\n\nWe'll update the review of the Back to Venus slot with the correct information, so be sure to check back for more details.\n\nIn terms of design, Back to Venus is very similar to the previous version. However, it has high-quality design and graphics, just like the 2012 version, which is a testament to its quality. Back to Venus offers advanced graphics that create a cartoon-like atmosphere.

With the same structure as its predecessor, Back to Venus makes it seem like aliens have invaded a farm, and gamers can enjoy this abduction through its high-quality design and graphics. As a five-reel, three-row, and 25-payline game, Back to Venus offers a couple of interesting bonus features, including wild and scatter symbols.\n\nThe game is set on a farm where a space carnivorous plant is on the hunt for a farmer. Back to Venus is a farm-style game similar to its predecessor. It will be available to play on all desktop and mobile devices.\n\nWhen it comes to BetSoft, the games they present are always advertised before release. Recently, the company has been revisiting some of its latest successes and adapting them to meet the modern demands of gambling. BetSoft is also expanding its reach into the Latin American market.\n\nExtraterrestrial Design\nBack to Venus slot game joins BetSoft's collection of newly released slots in 2020, and in this review, we'll go over the essential things you need to know about it. If this game seems familiar to you, you're not mistaken. Back to Venus is a new version of the slot game, It Came From Venus, with the same theme. This time, BetSoft's team returns with the same story, but with more attractive features and functions.\n\nBack to Venus is a video slot game with five reels and 25 paylines. It will be released in April 2020, so we don't have all the details yet. As far as we know, Back to Venus will offer wild and scatter symbols, as well as free spins. The range of bets is still unknown, as is the RTP. However, the game's predecessor, \"It Came From Venus,\" has an RTP of 95.80%, and bets range from €0.02 to €75, so we expect Back to Venus to have similar numbers.\n\nWe'll update the review of the Back to Venus slot with the correct information, so be sure to check back for more details.\n\nIn terms of design, Back to Venus is very similar to the previous version. However, it has high-quality design and graphics, just like the 2012 version, which is a testament to its quality. Back to Venus offers advanced graphics that create a cartoon-like atmosphere. As mentioned earlier, space carnivorous plants are the center of this game. As for the symbols, you have low-cost poker playing cards, as well as the farmer, the transformed astronaut, alien plants, barns, UFO rockets, and fields.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nThe game starts with the pressing of a round light green button located beneath the reels. This is the spin button that you need to press when you're ready to start playing. However, before that, you need to place your spin bet, which can be done by pressing the plus and minus buttons next to the spin button. Currently, we don't know how the bet will end up, so we'll update this review once we know.\n\nThere's an \"Autoplay\" button next to the \"Spin\" button that allows you to make automatic spins without having to press the spin button each time. Feel free to activate it if you want to enjoy this game hands-free.\n\nOne of the features that will be included in this game is the wild symbol that has its own logo and will behave like a typical substitute. It will replace all regular symbols except for scatters. Additionally, there's a Bonus Round symbol that will likely reward players with free spins.

With the same structure as its predecessor, Back to Venus makes it seem like aliens have invaded a farm, and gamers can enjoy this abduction through its high-quality design and graphics. As a five-reel, three-row, and 25-payline game, Back to Venus offers a couple of interesting bonus features, including wild and scatter symbols.\n\nThe game is set on a farm where a space carnivorous plant is on the hunt for a farmer. Back to Venus is a farm-style game similar to its predecessor. It will be available to play on all desktop and mobile devices.\n\nWhen it comes to BetSoft, the games they present are always advertised before release. Recently, the company has been revisiting some of its latest successes and adapting them to meet the modern demands of gambling. BetSoft is also expanding its reach into the Latin American market.\n\nExtraterrestrial Design\nBack to Venus slot game joins BetSoft's collection of newly released slots in 2020, and in this review, we'll go over the essential things you need to know about it. If this game seems familiar to you, you're not mistaken. Back to Venus is a new version of the slot game, It Came From Venus, with the same theme. This time, BetSoft's team returns with the same story, but with more attractive features and functions.\n\nBack to Venus is a video slot game with five reels and 25 paylines. It will be released in April 2020, so we don't have all the details yet. As far as we know, Back to Venus will offer wild and scatter symbols, as well as free spins. The range of bets is still unknown, as is the RTP. However, the game's predecessor, \"It Came From Venus,\" has an RTP of 95.80%, and bets range from €0.02 to €75, so we expect Back to Venus to have similar numbers.\n\nWe'll update the review of the Back to Venus slot with the correct information, so be sure to check back for more details.\n\nIn terms of design, Back to Venus is very similar to the previous version. However, it has high-quality design and graphics, just like the 2012 version, which is a testament to its quality. Back to Venus offers advanced graphics that create a cartoon-like atmosphere. As mentioned earlier, space carnivorous plants are the center of this game. As for the symbols, you have low-cost poker playing cards, as well as the farmer, the transformed astronaut, alien plants, barns, UFO rockets, and fields.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nThe game starts with the pressing of a round light green button located beneath the reels. This is the spin button that you need to press when you're ready to start playing. However, before that, you need to place your spin bet, which can be done by pressing the plus and minus buttons next to the spin button. Currently, we don't know how the bet will end up, so we'll update this review once we know.\n\nThere's an \"Autoplay\" button next to the \"Spin\" button that allows you to make automatic spins without having to press the spin button each time. Feel free to activate it if you want to enjoy this game hands-free.\n\nOne of the features that will be included in this game is the wild symbol that has its own logo and will behave like a typical substitute. It will replace all regular symbols except for scatters. Additionally, there's a Bonus Round symbol that will likely reward players with free spins. For now, we don't have any further details about the game's bonus features, but we'll update this review once we know more.\n\nTo win cash rewards, you need to land at least three matching symbols on a single payline, starting from the leftmost reel. As we currently know, there are 25 paylines in total in this game, which means that there are 25 winning combinations for cash reward scores. Also, wild and scatter symbols are here to increase your wins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIt Came From Venus revolves around the story of Skeeter, a simple farmer who lives on his farm and encounters aliens on his land. This is a 5-reel, 30-payline Betsoft Gaming video slot game with many rewards, surprises, and, of course, fantastic bonus features, with a rather exciting and advanced gameplay.\n\nThis online slot game has some amazing bonus features that could lead to lucrative rewards. The random game will trigger a multiplier from x2 up to x10.\n\nIn the so-called Feed Me bonus feature, landing three stacked food symbols will reward you with 11 free spins.\n            ",

With the same structure as its predecessor, Back to Venus makes it seem like aliens have invaded a farm, and gamers can enjoy this abduction through its high-quality design and graphics. As a five-reel, three-row, and 25-payline game, Back to Venus offers a couple of interesting bonus features, including wild and scatter symbols.\n\nThe game is set on a farm where a space carnivorous plant is on the hunt for a farmer. Back to Venus is a farm-style game similar to its predecessor. It will be available to play on all desktop and mobile devices.\n\nWhen it comes to BetSoft, the games they present are always advertised before release. Recently, the company has been revisiting some of its latest successes and adapting them to meet the modern demands of gambling. BetSoft is also expanding its reach into the Latin American market.\n\nExtraterrestrial Design\nBack to Venus slot game joins BetSoft's collection of newly released slots in 2020, and in this review, we'll go over the essential things you need to know about it. If this game seems familiar to you, you're not mistaken. Back to Venus is a new version of the slot game, It Came From Venus, with the same theme. This time, BetSoft's team returns with the same story, but with more attractive features and functions.\n\nBack to Venus is a video slot game with five reels and 25 paylines. It will be released in April 2020, so we don't have all the details yet. As far as we know, Back to Venus will offer wild and scatter symbols, as well as free spins. The range of bets is still unknown, as is the RTP. However, the game's predecessor, \"It Came From Venus,\" has an RTP of 95.80%, and bets range from €0.02 to €75, so we expect Back to Venus to have similar numbers.\n\nWe'll update the review of the Back to Venus slot with the correct information, so be sure to check back for more details.\n\nIn terms of design, Back to Venus is very similar to the previous version. However, it has high-quality design and graphics, just like the 2012 version, which is a testament to its quality. Back to Venus offers advanced graphics that create a cartoon-like atmosphere. As mentioned earlier, space carnivorous plants are the center of this game. As for the symbols, you have low-cost poker playing cards, as well as the farmer, the transformed astronaut, alien plants, barns, UFO rockets, and fields.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nThe game starts with the pressing of a round light green button located beneath the reels. This is the spin button that you need to press when you're ready to start playing. However, before that, you need to place your spin bet, which can be done by pressing the plus and minus buttons next to the spin button. Currently, we don't know how the bet will end up, so we'll update this review once we know.\n\nThere's an \"Autoplay\" button next to the \"Spin\" button that allows you to make automatic spins without having to press the spin button each time. Feel free to activate it if you want to enjoy this game hands-free.\n\nOne of the features that will be included in this game is the wild symbol that has its own logo and will behave like a typical substitute. It will replace all regular symbols except for scatters. Additionally, there's a Bonus Round symbol that will likely reward players with free spins. For now, we don't have any further details about the game's bonus features, but we'll update this review once we know more.\n\nTo win cash rewards, you need to land at least three matching symbols on a single payline, starting from the leftmost reel. As we currently know, there are 25 paylines in total in this game, which means that there are 25 winning combinations for cash reward scores. Also, wild and scatter symbols are here to increase your wins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIt Came From Venus revolves around the story of Skeeter, a simple farmer who lives on his farm and encounters aliens on his land. This is a 5-reel, 30-payline Betsoft Gaming video slot game with many rewards, surprises, and, of course, fantastic bonus features, with a rather exciting and advanced gameplay.\n\nThis online slot game has some amazing bonus features that could lead to lucrative rewards. The random game will trigger a multiplier from x2 up to x10.\n\nIn the so-called Feed Me bonus feature, landing three stacked food symbols will reward you with 11 free spins.\n            ",
