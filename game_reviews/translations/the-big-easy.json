The reasons? Firstly, the choice of theme and setting, truly original and engaging, which, combined with an intuitive but entertaining gameplay and a respectable payout, lead us to wholeheartedly endorse this slot!\nWith Big Easy, we find ourselves immersed in the jazz atmosphere of New Orleans, one of the American capitals of music: the beautiful graphics and thematic symbols make for a truly captivating gaming experience, but the game would not be so effective from this point of view without the beautiful soundtrack, jazz, of course.\nThere are no bonus games, but there are Wild and Scatter symbols and the possibility of getting free spins and multipliers, which more than make up for this lack.\nFurthermore, the most daring players can further bet on their winnings, whatever the amount, thanks to the Gamble feature: after a win, a turned card will appear on the screen and if you guess the color correctly, the entire amount of the win will be doubled, but if you guess wrong, you will lose everything!\n\nRegular and special symbols, Wild and Scatter of Big Easy Slot\nAll the symbols in this slot machine are thematic, which is another point in favor of Big Easy and we don't miss the traditional poker cards at all.\nWe find jazz musicians, pianos, but also glasses of whiskey and shrimp on plates (which we don't quite understand) among the regular symbols.\nAs for the special symbols, there are essentially two: the Moon and the game logo with the words \"Big Easy.\"\nThe first represents the Scatter and if it appears at least three times in any position on the reels, it allows you to get 10 free spins.\nThe slot logo is the Wild symbol: it acts as a wildcard and can replace all other symbols except the Scatter to complete a winning combination; moreover, if it appears on all five reels, it allows you to win a payout equal to 20 times the bet.\n\nThe twin slot: Jazz of New Orleans\nWe liked this slot so much that we looked for a similar one to continue playing immersed in the smoky atmosphere of jazz clubs in New Orleans: we found a practically identical one, with the same theme and setting.\nIt's called Jazz of New Orleans, produced by Play'n Go: this slot has amazing graphics and a series of bonus games that allow you to increase your chances of winning and have fun! The symbols are practically the same and the Moon and the logo of the slot also respectively represent the Scatter and the Wild!\nWe also recommend trying this one!\n\n\nFAQ - The Big Easy\nWhere can I play The Big Easy for free?\n\nYou can play The Big Easy and hundreds of other slots without registering or downloading any software on SlotJava, easy right?

It acts as a wildcard, just like that jazzy friend who knows all the right moves on the dance floor.</p>\n\n    <p>And if you get lucky enough to land all five Big Easy logos on the reels, you'll be rewarded with a payout equal to 20 times your initial bet. That's like hitting the jackpot! It's safe to say that this slot game is quite easy on the eyes and the wallet.</p>\n\n    <p>Overall, the Big Easy offers a fun and rewarding gaming experience with its regular and special symbols, Wilds, and Scatters. Whether you're a fan of jazz music or just looking for a chance to win big, this slot game is worth checking out. Just be cautious, because the Big Easy may have you tapping your feet and snapping your fingers to the beat in no time. Play at your own risk!</p>\"\n}"
