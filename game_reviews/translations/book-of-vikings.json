Pragmatic Play follows this tradition by offering a product that lives up to expectations. The theme is centered on the Poetic Edda, the sacred book of Norse mythology, which collects poems and mysteries of this ancient civilization.\n\nThe reels move on a background that evokes the icy landscapes typical of Northern Countries, accompanied by an epic music that adds significant pathos to the game. The console buttons are kept to a minimum, with the bet value, the plus and minus buttons, and the Start button that also acts as Autoplay.\n\nBook of Vikings is therefore a slot machine that is very well looked after even in the details, but with easy and intuitive gameplay that makes it suitable for everyone!\n\nMain features of the slot game\nPragmatic Play has decided to focus on a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The 10 paylines are fixed, and it is possible to bet between €0.10 and €100. The strong point of this slot is undoubtedly the RTP value of 96.5% and high volatility. This means that on average, Book of Vikings pays out less frequently, but the wins are always substantial. The paying combinations are from left to right, and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, only the highest value one will be paid. Instead, if the winning combinations occur on different lines, then the wins will be added up. Through the Autoplay button, it is possible to set between 10 and 100 automatic spins and some win or loss limits.\n\nSymbols and features of Book of Vikings\nAs usual, the lower value symbols are the playing cards, from 10 to Ace. However, being high volatility, the amounts are still significant if we consider that the lowest value symbol, if it appears 5 times, pays out €1. The thematic symbols are instead the ones that pay out the most: considering the minimum bet (€0.10), the horn and helmet pay out up to a maximum of €7.50, the female warrior €20 and the male warrior €50. The true symbol is, however, the book, which takes on the dual function of Wild and Scatter. In the first case, it replaces all symbols and pays out up to 200x the total bet, while the Scatter function is activated when 3 or more books appear on the reels. In this case, you will be entitled to 10 free spins. Before the Bonus game starts, a special symbol is randomly selected, which extends to cover all 3 positions on the reel. Additional 3 Scatter symbols entitle you to 10 new Free Spins, with no limit to the number of reactivations.\n            ",

The game is accompanied by an epic soundtrack that adds to its overall immersive experience. The console buttons are minimalist, and the game's graphics are visually engaging. Pragmatic Play has paid attention to detail making this game suitable for lovers of both great visuals and audio elements.\n\nPaylines and betting range\n\nThe 10 paylines in Book of Vikings are fixed, and players can bet between €0.10 and €100. Though the game is high volatile, even the lowest paying symbol can still earn you significant amounts, €1 if it appears 5 times. The thematic symbols, such as the horn, helmet, female warrior, and male warrior, pay out the most. The highest paying symbol, the book, can also earn you up to 200x the total bet, acting as both the Wild and Scatter symbol. \n\nBonus round and free spins\n\nThe Book symbol of Book of Vikings acts as both the Wild and Scatter symbol, and 3 or more of it appearing on the reels trigger the Bonus round, which awards players 10 free spins. Before the bonus round starts, a special symbol is randomly selected, which then extends to cover all 3 positions on the reel. Players can earn more free spins by landing additional 3 Scatter symbols during the Free Spin rounds. There are no limits to the number of reactivations available to players.\n\nRTP value and volatility\n\nBook of Vikings has an RTP value of 96.5%, and it is a high volatile game. This simply means that the game pays out less frequently, but when it does, the wins are always substantial. This is, therefore, a game designed for players who know the risks involved and are willing to take them for the chance to earn huge payouts.\n\n        \n            ",

Pragmatic Play follows this tradition by offering a product that lives up to expectations. The theme is centered on the Poetic Edda, the sacred book of Norse mythology, which collects poems and mysteries of this ancient civilization.\n\nThe reels move on a background that evokes the icy landscapes typical of Northern Countries, accompanied by an epic music that adds significant pathos to the game. The console buttons are kept to a minimum, with the bet value, the plus and minus buttons, and the Start button that also acts as Autoplay.\n\nBook of Vikings is therefore a slot machine that is very well looked after even in the details, but with easy and intuitive gameplay that makes it suitable for everyone!\n\nMain features of the slot game\nPragmatic Play has decided to focus on a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The 10 paylines are fixed, and it is possible to bet between €0.10 and €100. The strong point of this slot is undoubtedly the RTP value of 96.5% and high volatility. This means that on average, Book of Vikings pays out less frequently, but the wins are always substantial. The paying combinations are from left to right, and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, only the highest value one will be paid. Instead, if the winning combinations occur on different lines, then the wins will be added up. Through the Autoplay button, it is possible to set between 10 and 100 automatic spins and some win or loss limits.\n\nSymbols and features of Book of Vikings\nAs usual, the lower value symbols are the playing cards, from 10 to Ace. However, being high volatility, the amounts are still significant if we consider that the lowest value symbol, if it appears 5 times, pays out €1. The thematic symbols are instead the ones that pay out the most: considering the minimum bet (€0.10), the horn and helmet pay out up to a maximum of €7.50, the female warrior €20 and the male warrior €50. The true symbol is, however, the book, which takes on the dual function of Wild and Scatter. In the first case, it replaces all symbols and pays out up to 200x the total bet, while the Scatter function is activated when 3 or more books appear on the reels. In this case, you will be entitled to 10 free spins. Before the Bonus game starts, a special symbol is randomly selected, which extends to cover all 3 positions on the reel. Additional 3 Scatter symbols entitle you to 10 new Free Spins, with no limit to the number of reactivations.\n            ",

Pragmatic Play follows this tradition by offering a product that lives up to expectations. The theme is centered on the Poetic Edda, the sacred book of Norse mythology, which collects poems and mysteries of this ancient civilization.\n\nThe reels move on a background that evokes the icy landscapes typical of Northern Countries, accompanied by an epic music that adds significant pathos to the game. The console buttons are kept to a minimum, with the bet value, the plus and minus buttons, and the Start button that also acts as Autoplay.\n\nBook of Vikings is therefore a slot machine that is very well looked after even in the details, but with easy and intuitive gameplay that makes it suitable for everyone!\n\nMain features of the slot game\nPragmatic Play has decided to focus on a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The 10 paylines are fixed, and it is possible to bet between €0.10 and €100. The strong point of this slot is undoubtedly the RTP value of 96.5% and high volatility. This means that on average, Book of Vikings pays out less frequently, but the wins are always substantial. The paying combinations are from left to right, and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, only the highest value one will be paid. Instead, if the winning combinations occur on different lines, then the wins will be added up. Through the Autoplay button, it is possible to set between 10 and 100 automatic spins and some win or loss limits.\n\nSymbols and features of Book of Vikings\nAs usual, the lower value symbols are the playing cards, from 10 to Ace. However, being high volatility, the amounts are still significant if we consider that the lowest value symbol, if it appears 5 times, pays out €1. The thematic symbols are instead the ones that pay out the most: considering the minimum bet (€0.10), the horn and helmet pay out up to a maximum of €7.50, the female warrior €20 and the male warrior €50. The true symbol is, however, the book, which takes on the dual function of Wild and Scatter. In the first case, it replaces all symbols and pays out up to 200x the total bet, while the Scatter function is activated when 3 or more books appear on the reels. In this case, you will be entitled to 10 free spins. Before the Bonus game starts, a special symbol is randomly selected, which extends to cover all 3 positions on the reel. Additional 3 Scatter symbols entitle you to 10 new Free Spins, with no limit to the number of reactivations.\n            ",
