Piuttosto si parla di un giovane avventuriero con uno spiccato senso per il pericolo, attirato dai misteri come le api al miele. Il protagonista di Book of Tombs è un clone di Indiana Jones, alle prese con una missione per niente facile. Scovare il libro misterioso del faraone e mettere le mani su un tesoro di inestimabile valore.\nNaturalmente siamo in Egitto, all’interno di una piramide tra sarcofagi e statue del dio Anubi. Come di consueto, quando si parla di slot a tema egizio, la grafica la fa da padrone. In Book of Tombs poi è davvero straordinaria, con una risoluzione degna dei migliori film di animazione e con il colore oro a fare da sfondo all’intero gioco. La console di gioco si limita al tasto Start, al saldo e alle impostazioni per settare la giocata. Per le altre informazioni, come ad esempio i giri automatici o le impostazioni per mancini, è necessario invece accedere al menù interno dai tasti posti sulla destra. La musica di Book of Tombs è carica di mistero, ma non invasiva e gli effetti acustici sono limitati alle combinazioni vincenti.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia ha 5 rulli e 3 righe su cui sono presenti 10 linee di pagamento fisse. La puntata totale è paria a 0,10 €, la massima invece è di 75 €. Si vince con almeno 2 simboli identici adiacenti da sinistra a destra. Volendo, si possono impostare fino a 1.000 giri automatici. La volatilità è alta e l’RTP è del 95,42%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nIn Book of Tombs abbiamo simboli minori e simboli maggiori. I primi sono rappresentati dalle carte da gioco dal 10 all’Asso, con una vincita massima di 1,20 € nel caso compaiano 5 simboli identici. I simboli di maggior valore sono quelli tematici: vaso, il sarcofago, la statua del dio Anubi e naturalmente l’esploratore.\nIl simbolo del libro magico ricopre la funzione di Wild ma anche di Scatter: nel primo caso sostituisce tutti i simboli tranne quelli a espansione, nel secondo caso attivano i Free Spins, 8 per la precisione. Se durante di essi dovessero comparire altri 3 Scatter, allora avremo diritto a 8 ulteriori giri gratuiti. Prima che parta il gioco Bonus, viene scelto in modo casuale un Expanding symbols che copre tutto il rullo, coì da aumentare in modo vertiginoso la possibilità di vincite di un certo livello. È possibile sino a un massimo di 9 simboli a espansione diversi. In questo caso per vincere non è necessario che i simboli siano adiacenti.\n",

Rather, he is a young adventurer with a keen sense of danger, drawn to mysteries like bees to honey. The protagonist of Book of Tombs is a clone of Indiana Jones, facing a mission that is by no means easy: to discover the mysterious book of the Pharaoh and get their hands on a treasure of immeasurable value.\n\nNaturally, we are in Egypt, inside a pyramid among sarcophagi and statues of the god Anubis. As usual, when it comes to Egyptian-themed slots, the graphics reign supreme. In Book of Tombs, the graphics are truly extraordinary, with a resolution worthy of the best animated films and with the color gold serving as the background throughout the game. The game console is limited to the Start button, balance and settings to adjust the bet. For other information, such as automatic spins or left-hand settings, you must access the internal menu using the buttons on the right. The music of Book of Tombs is full of mystery, but non-invasive, and the acoustic effects are limited to winning combinations.\n\nFeatures of the slot\nThe grid has 5 reels and 3 rows on which there are 10 fixed paylines. The total bet is €0.10, while the maximum bet is €75. You can win with at least 2 adjacent identical symbols from left to right. If desired, you can set up to 1,000 automatic spins. The volatility is high and the RTP is 95.42%.\n\nSymbols and features\nIn Book of Tombs, there are minor symbols and major symbols. The former are represented by playing cards from 10 to Ace, with a maximum win of €1.20 if 5 identical symbols appear. The higher value symbols are the thematic ones: a vase, a sarcophagus, a statue of the god Anubis, and of course, the explorer.\n\nThe symbol of the magical book covers the function of both Wild and Scatter: in the first case, it replaces all symbols except for the expanding ones, while in the second case, it activates Free Spins, 8 to be precise. If during those spins, another 3 Scatters appear, then we are entitled to 8 more free spins. Before the Bonus game starts, an Expanding symbol is randomly chosen that covers the entire reel, increasing the possibility of winnings of a certain level in a dizzying way. It is possible to have up to 9 different expanding symbols. In this case, it's not necessary for the symbols to be adjacent to win.\n            ",

Rather, he is a young adventurer with a keen sense of danger, drawn to mysteries like bees to honey. The protagonist of Book of Tombs is a clone of Indiana Jones, facing a mission that is by no means easy: to discover the mysterious book of the Pharaoh and get their hands on a treasure of immeasurable value.\n\nNaturally, we are in Egypt, inside a pyramid among sarcophagi and statues of the god Anubis. As usual, when it comes to Egyptian-themed slots, the graphics reign supreme. In Book of Tombs, the graphics are truly extraordinary, with a resolution worthy of the best animated films and with the color gold serving as the background throughout the game. The game console is limited to the Start button, balance and settings to adjust the bet. For other information, such as automatic spins or left-hand settings, you must access the internal menu using the buttons on the right. The music of Book of Tombs is full of mystery, but non-invasive, and the acoustic effects are limited to winning combinations.\n\nFeatures of the slot\nThe grid has 5 reels and 3 rows on which there are 10 fixed paylines. The total bet is €0.10, while the maximum bet is €75. You can win with at least 2 adjacent identical symbols from left to right. If desired, you can set up to 1,000 automatic spins. The volatility is high and the RTP is 95.42%.\n\nSymbols and features\nIn Book of Tombs, there are minor symbols and major symbols. The former are represented by playing cards from 10 to Ace, with a maximum win of €1.20 if 5 identical symbols appear. The higher value symbols are the thematic ones: a vase, a sarcophagus, a statue of the god Anubis, and of course, the explorer.\n\nThe symbol of the magical book covers the function of both Wild and Scatter: in the first case, it replaces all symbols except for the expanding ones, while in the second case, it activates Free Spins, 8 to be precise. If during those spins, another 3 Scatters appear, then we are entitled to 8 more free spins. Before the Bonus game starts, an Expanding symbol is randomly chosen that covers the entire reel, increasing the possibility of winnings of a certain level in a dizzying way. It is possible to have up to 9 different expanding symbols. In this case, it's not necessary for the symbols to be adjacent to win.\n            ",

Rather, he is a young adventurer with a keen sense of danger, drawn to mysteries like bees to honey. The protagonist of Book of Tombs is a clone of Indiana Jones, facing a mission that is by no means easy: to discover the mysterious book of the Pharaoh and get their hands on a treasure of immeasurable value.\n\nNaturally, we are in Egypt, inside a pyramid among sarcophagi and statues of the god Anubis. As usual, when it comes to Egyptian-themed slots, the graphics reign supreme. In Book of Tombs, the graphics are truly extraordinary, with a resolution worthy of the best animated films and with the color gold serving as the background throughout the game. The game console is limited to the Start button, balance and settings to adjust the bet. For other information, such as automatic spins or left-hand settings, you must access the internal menu using the buttons on the right. The music of Book of Tombs is full of mystery, but non-invasive, and the acoustic effects are limited to winning combinations.\n\nFeatures of the slot\nThe grid has 5 reels and 3 rows on which there are 10 fixed paylines. The total bet is €0.10, while the maximum bet is €75. You can win with at least 2 adjacent identical symbols from left to right. If desired, you can set up to 1,000 automatic spins. The volatility is high and the RTP is 95.42%.\n\nSymbols and features\nIn Book of Tombs, there are minor symbols and major symbols. The former are represented by playing cards from 10 to Ace, with a maximum win of €1.20 if 5 identical symbols appear. The higher value symbols are the thematic ones: a vase, a sarcophagus, a statue of the god Anubis, and of course, the explorer.\n\nThe symbol of the magical book covers the function of both Wild and Scatter: in the first case, it replaces all symbols except for the expanding ones, while in the second case, it activates Free Spins, 8 to be precise. If during those spins, another 3 Scatters appear, then we are entitled to 8 more free spins. Before the Bonus game starts, an Expanding symbol is randomly chosen that covers the entire reel, increasing the possibility of winnings of a certain level in a dizzying way. It is possible to have up to 9 different expanding symbols. In this case, it's not necessary for the symbols to be adjacent to win.\n            ",
