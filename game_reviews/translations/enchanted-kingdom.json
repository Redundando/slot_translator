What ties these different types of slots together are the magical creatures, the hidden treasures waiting to be discovered, and the potential rewards that come with them. \n\nThe software provider WMS has taken advantage of this theme to create a magical slot game that promises great payouts and a lot of fun. Enchanted Kingdom is not exactly a novelty, since it has been present in the gambling market as a land-based game for some time now. However, it has recently been launched as an online game, maintaining the key features of its offline counterpart. \n\nAs of now, Enchanted Kingdom can be found in online casinos that are part of the Play4Fun network. The game boasts a well-realized graphical interface, with sharp and vibrant images of a forest filled with accurately represented animals and plants. Though there are no special effects or 3D animations, Enchanted Kingdom remains a visually pleasing and enjoyable slot machine to play. \n\nKey features of the slot \n\nIt should be noted that if you are looking for a slot machine with complex gameplay, numerous features, and thrilling surprises, Enchanted Kingdom may not be your game of choice. It is indeed a slot with an extremely simple gameplay that could possibly be good for beginners. \n\nThe game consists of five reels, three rows, and 30 fixed paylines, with bets starting at a minimum of 30 cents and going up to a maximum of 150 euros, with a coin value ranging from 1 cent to 5 euros. The theoretical return to player (RTP) of Enchanted Kingdom can be considered satisfactory, sitting at 96.19%, which is the average for most slot games, also being in line with other Williams Interactive slots. \n\nIn terms of volatility, Enchanted Kingdom is a slot with medium variance. As such, players can expect smaller yet frequent payouts, with some chances of winning bigger rewards. \n\nSymbols and features of Enchanted Kingdom \n\nAll of Enchanted Kingdom's symbols are thematic, with no playing card symbols present. The reels feature magical castles, squirrels, toads with crowns, red-capped mushrooms, crowns and more. The wild is represented by a beautiful princess, who serves as a joker and is also the most profitable symbol. \n\nThe crown represents the scatter symbol. If it appears on the reels at least three times, it triggers the bonus free spins that come with a x3 multiplier on each win during the feature. Additionally, if the crown appears again during the free spins, it triggers another round of 20 extra spins. \n\nExperience the magic of Enchanted Kingdom. Try it now at Play4Fun casinos.",

The graphics are sharp, brightly colored, but without any special effects or 3D animations. However, overall, it is a very pleasant game to watch and play.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nEnchanted Kingdom is a simple slot game that consists of five reels, three rows, and 30 fixed paylines. It is an excellent option for novice players. The minimum bet is 30 cents, and the maximum is 150€, with a token value ranging from 1 cent to 5€. The slot is characterized by medium variance, so players can expect small, quite frequent wins, with some chance of obtaining prizes of a certain value.\n\nSymbols and Payouts\n\nThe slot game features thematic symbols, including magical castles, squirrels, frogs with crowns, mushrooms with red hats, and others. The Wild is represented by a beautiful princess, who acts as a wild card and is also the most profitable symbol. The crown is the scatter symbol that can activate the bonus of free spins where each win is multiplied by x3.\n\nBetting Options and RTP\n\nBets can be placed starting from a minimum of 30 cents up to a maximum of 150€, with a token value ranging from 1 cent to 5€. The theoretical return to player (RTP) of Enchanted Kingdom is 96.19%, which is satisfactory and falls within the average of most slot games. The slot is characterized by medium variance.\n\nAvailability and Network\n\nEnchanted Kingdom is an online slot game that has been present in the gambling market for some time with its land version and has only recently been launched as an online game, but maintaining the main characteristics of its VLT counterpart. The slot is currently available in online casinos that are part of the Play4Fun network.\n\n        \n            ",

Actually, Enchanted Kingdom is not really new, as it has been present in the gambling market for some time with its land version and has only recently been launched as an online game, but maintaining the main characteristics of its VLT counterpart.\nEnchanted Kingdom can currently be found in online casinos that are part of the Play4Fun network.\nAs for the graphic compartment, it is undoubtedly a well-made product: the images are sharp and brightly colored, and the game grid is immersed in a sort of enchanted forest populated by animals and plants accurately reproduced. There are no particular special effects nor 3D animations and overall, Enchanted Kingdom is a very traditional but pleasant slot machine to watch and play.\nKey features of the slot:\nLet's say it straight away, if you're looking for a slot machine with a complex gameplay mode, with a thousand features and adrenaline at every spin, Enchanted Kingdom is probably not the game for you! This is an extremely simple slot with no surprises, but it could be excellent for novice players.\nThe structure consists of five reels, three rows and 30 fixed paylines, on which bets can be placed starting from a minimum of 30 cents up to a maximum of 150€, with a token value ranging from 1 cent to 5€.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of Enchanted Kingdom can be considered satisfactory: with a percentage of 96.19%, it falls perfectly within the average of most slot games, as well as being in line with other Williams Interactive slots.\nRegarding volatility, this is a slot characterized by medium variance, so you can expect to obtain small and quite frequent wins, with some chance of getting hold of prizes of a certain value.\nSymbols and features of Enchanted Kingdom:\nAll symbols of Enchanted Kingdom are thematic and there are no playing cards: on the reels, magical castles, squirrels, frogs with crowns, mushrooms with red hats, crowns and others alternate. The Wild is represented by a beautiful princess, who acts as a wild card and is also the most profitable symbol.\nThe crown, on the other hand, is the scatter: if it appears on the reels for at least three times, it leads to the bonus of free spins where each win is multiplied by x3; furthermore, if the crown appears again during the free spins, it awards an additional 20 free spins every time.\n        ",
