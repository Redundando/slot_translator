After the first chapter, set in the 19th century in Mississippi or thereabouts, the other episodes were infused with steampunk veins, creating futuristic games but never forgetting the main theme. With Money Train Origins Dream Drop, we go back to the origins, like in a hypothetical circle that closes. \n\nAs soon as we load the game, we are presented with the characters and the setting, as if we were in front of an animated film and not a slot. \n\nThe game grid is set in a train car from which rifles, knives, and guns protrude from the slots, and the symbols have a very high definition. For example, the playing card suits seem to be in relief thanks to shading and color differences. \n\nGame features\n\nRelax Gaming has opted for a classic game grid with 5 reels and 4 rows on which 40 fixed paylines reside. The bet starts at 0.20 virtual coins, and you can win a sum equal to 10,000 times your bet. Among the game options, we find the Quick Spin button, which speeds up the fall of the symbols, and the Autoplay button, which allows you to set from 5 to 1,000 automatic spins. \n\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is quite low, being equal to 94%. \n\nHow to win at Money Train Origins Dream Drop\n\nThe aim of the game is naturally to match as many identical symbols as possible on an active payline. As for the basic symbols, there are 8 divided equally between high and low-value ones. The first group includes the playing card suits, namely diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades. More remunerative are the symbols belonging to the second group, represented by the four characters. To clearly know the value of each of them, we recommend taking a look at the payments table found within the menu. \n\nThe knife is our Wild and has a truly special function because, in addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, it pays out as much as the highest value symbol. \n\nThe first Bonus we encounter is the Dream Drop, introduced by the exploding dynamite. On the grid, we will only see golden DD symbols land, but hay bales may also arrive. In that case, the function is not activated. Once the grid is full, all we have to do is click on the symbols to reveal the jackpot. If you find three identical ones, the sum is paid out. \n\nThe safe is another Bonus symbol, and when three of them land on the reels, they reward with as many respins that are reactivated with each special symbol. Filling a column with a special symbol adds a reel. \n\nHere are the extra symbols that can land: \n\nBonus Symbol: It's a multiplier ranging from 1x to 10x \nCollector: It appropriates the value of all the symbols present at that moment and adds it to its value \nPayer: Applies a multiplier to all symbols \nBanker: Offers a multiplier that applies to all present and future symbols \nHealer: Ensures that the symbols remain on the reels for the number of spins indicated by the symbol \nPersistent Collector: Collects all prizes and adds them at the end of the current spin and in future ones \nPersistent Payer: Reveals a multiplier and adds it to present and future symbols.\n\nIf all positions are filled without using the Healer, you win a prize equal to 1,000x your bet! \n\nFAQs.",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Money Train Origins Dream Drop\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nMoney Train Origins Dream Drop Review\n\nThe Money Train Origins Dream Drop slot game from provider Relax Gaming is a game rich in bonuses, paylines, and a potential win of up to 10,000x your bet! \n\nA trip to the past\n\nOver time, Relax Gaming has released a series of slots featuring a train and characters from the Wild West. After the first chapter, set in the 19th century in Mississippi or thereabouts, the other episodes were infused with steampunk veins, creating futuristic games but never forgetting the main theme. With Money Train Origins Dream Drop, we go back to the origins, like in a hypothetical circle that closes. \n\nAs soon as we load the game, we are presented with the characters and the setting, as if we were in front of an animated film and not a slot. \n\nThe game grid is set in a train car from which rifles, knives, and guns protrude from the slots, and the symbols have a very high definition. For example, the playing card suits seem to be in relief thanks to shading and color differences. \n\nGame features\n\nRelax Gaming has opted for a classic game grid with 5 reels and 4 rows on which 40 fixed paylines reside. The bet starts at 0.20 virtual coins, and you can win a sum equal to 10,000 times your bet. Among the game options, we find the Quick Spin button, which speeds up the fall of the symbols, and the Autoplay button, which allows you to set from 5 to 1,000 automatic spins. \n\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is quite low, being equal to 94%. \n\nHow to win at Money Train Origins Dream Drop\n\nThe aim of the game is naturally to match as many identical symbols as possible on an active payline. As for the basic symbols, there are 8 divided equally between high and low-value ones. The first group includes the playing card suits, namely diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades. More remunerative are the symbols belonging to the second group, represented by the four characters. To clearly know the value of each of them, we recommend taking a look at the payments table found within the menu. \n\nThe knife is our Wild and has a truly special function because, in addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, it pays out as much as the highest value symbol. \n\nThe first Bonus we encounter is the Dream Drop, introduced by the exploding dynamite. On the grid, we will only see golden DD symbols land, but hay bales may also arrive. In that case, the function is not activated. Once the grid is full, all we have to do is click on the symbols to reveal the jackpot. If you find three identical ones, the sum is paid out. \n\nThe safe is another Bonus symbol, and when three of them land on the reels, they reward with as many respins that are reactivated with each special symbol. Filling a column with a special symbol adds a reel. \n\nHere are the extra symbols that can land: \n\nBonus Symbol: It's a multiplier ranging from 1x to 10x \nCollector: It appropriates the value of all the symbols present at that moment and adds it to its value \nPayer: Applies a multiplier to all symbols \nBanker: Offers a multiplier that applies to all present and future symbols \nHealer: Ensures that the symbols remain on the reels for the number of spins indicated by the symbol \nPersistent Collector: Collects all prizes and adds them at the end of the current spin and in future ones \nPersistent Payer: Reveals a multiplier and adds it to present and future symbols.\n\nIf all positions are filled without using the Healer, you win a prize equal to 1,000x your bet! \n\nFAQs.\n        ",

After the first chapter, set in the 19th century in Mississippi or thereabouts, the other episodes were infused with steampunk veins, creating futuristic games but never forgetting the main theme. With Money Train Origins Dream Drop, we go back to the origins, like in a hypothetical circle that closes. \n\nAs soon as we load the game, we are presented with the characters and the setting, as if we were in front of an animated film and not a slot. \n\nThe game grid is set in a train car from which rifles, knives, and guns protrude from the slots, and the symbols have a very high definition. For example, the playing card suits seem to be in relief thanks to shading and color differences. \n\nGame features\n\nRelax Gaming has opted for a classic game grid with 5 reels and 4 rows on which 40 fixed paylines reside. The bet starts at 0.20 virtual coins, and you can win a sum equal to 10,000 times your bet. Among the game options, we find the Quick Spin button, which speeds up the fall of the symbols, and the Autoplay button, which allows you to set from 5 to 1,000 automatic spins. \n\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is quite low, being equal to 94%. \n\nHow to win at Money Train Origins Dream Drop\n\nThe aim of the game is naturally to match as many identical symbols as possible on an active payline. As for the basic symbols, there are 8 divided equally between high and low-value ones. The first group includes the playing card suits, namely diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades. More remunerative are the symbols belonging to the second group, represented by the four characters. To clearly know the value of each of them, we recommend taking a look at the payments table found within the menu. \n\nThe knife is our Wild and has a truly special function because, in addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, it pays out as much as the highest value symbol. \n\nThe first Bonus we encounter is the Dream Drop, introduced by the exploding dynamite. On the grid, we will only see golden DD symbols land, but hay bales may also arrive. In that case, the function is not activated. Once the grid is full, all we have to do is click on the symbols to reveal the jackpot. If you find three identical ones, the sum is paid out. \n\nThe safe is another Bonus symbol, and when three of them land on the reels, they reward with as many respins that are reactivated with each special symbol. Filling a column with a special symbol adds a reel. \n\nHere are the extra symbols that can land: \n\nBonus Symbol: It's a multiplier ranging from 1x to 10x \nCollector: It appropriates the value of all the symbols present at that moment and adds it to its value \nPayer: Applies a multiplier to all symbols \nBanker: Offers a multiplier that applies to all present and future symbols \nHealer: Ensures that the symbols remain on the reels for the number of spins indicated by the symbol \nPersistent Collector: Collects all prizes and adds them at the end of the current spin and in future ones \nPersistent Payer: Reveals a multiplier and adds it to present and future symbols.\n\nIf all positions are filled without using the Healer, you win a prize equal to 1,000x your bet! \n\nFAQs.\n            ",

The game features a knife Wild. The Dream Drop Bonus function is introduced by the exploding dynamite and rewarded with the golden DD symbols. Once the grid is full, click on the symbols to reveal the jackpot. There is also the safe Bonus, activated when three of them land on the reels, that reward you with as many respins that are reactivated with each special symbol. Filling a column with a special symbol adds a reel. Other extra symbols such as Collector, Payer, Banker, Healer, Persistent Collector, Persistent Payer, and Bonus Symbol can also land, offering different multipliers and rewards. \n\nGraphics and Visuals\n\nMoney Train Origins Dream Drop has high-definition graphics with a retro Wild West theme. The game grid is set in a train car from which rifles, knives, and guns protrude from the slots. The symbols have a very high definition and the playing card suits seem to be in relief thanks to shading and color differences. The setting of the game and the characters have been presented in fantastic detail making it feel like an animated film instead of just a slot game. \n\nSound and Music\n\nThe sound and music of Money Train Origins Dream Drop complement the Wild West theme of the game. The background music is slow, with the gentle clunking of the train's wheels in the background and occasional bursts of sound effects that follow the actions on the reels, such as the sound of gunfire when the Wild symbol appears. Overall, the sound and music add to the overall playing experience of the game. \n\nWinning Potential\n\nMoney Train Origins Dream Drop is a high volatility game, and while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is quite low, being equal to 94%, you can still win a sum equal to 10,000 times your bet. There are several payouts with different multipliers and rewards, including a bonus game where filling all positions with no healer symbol wins you a prize equal to 1,000x your bet. The game's winning potential is high, and players can enjoy several gameplay and bonus features that can lead to more winning opportunities. \n\nOverall Impression\n\nMoney Train Origins Dream Drop from Relax Gaming delivers a fantastic blend of classic slot gameplay with unique and innovative features. The graphics, sound, and bonuses are all high-quality, allowing players to immerse themselves in the Wild West-inspired world. The game is action-packed, and the possibility of winning up to 10,000x your bet makes it all the more exciting. Though the game’s theoretical return to player may be lower than some players’ preferences, it is still a game worth trying due to its exciting features and potential rewards.\n\n        \n            ",

The betting range starts at 0.20 virtual coins, and the highest win is equal to 10,000 times the bet. Players can use the Quick Spin and Autoplay buttons included in the game. The volatility is high, and the theoretical RTP is 94%. The aim of the game is to match as many identical symbols as possible on an active payline. There are 8 basic symbols, including the playing card suits and four characters. The knife is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except for the Scatter. The game also includes many bonus symbols, such as the Dream Drop and the safe, which rewards you with respins that are reactivated with each special symbol.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nMoney Train Origins Dream Drop has a Wild West theme that will take players back in time. The game has a high-quality design with symbols that offer a realistic look with multiple colors and shading. The symbols are set on a train car from which rifles, knives, and guns protrude. The characters are presented in the setting, giving players an experience like they are watching an animated film.\n\nPayout Potential\n\nMoney Train Origins Dream Drop offers a maximum win of 10,000 times the bet, providing players with high payout potential. The game is highly volatile, which means that big wins can be encountered regularly. However, the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 94%, which is quite low compared to other slots.\n\nBonus Rounds and Free Spins\n\nThe game has numerous bonus symbols that add to the excitement, such as the Dream Drop and the safe. The Dream Drop feature is activated by exploding dynamite, filling the grid with golden DD symbols. A jackpot is revealed when three identical symbols are found. The safe symbol rewards players with respins that are reactivated with each special symbol. Other bonus symbols include the multiplier, collector, payer, banker, healer, persistent collector, and persistent payer. If all positions are filled without using the healer, a prize equal to 1,000x the bet is won.\n\nOverall Impressions\n\nWith plenty of features and high payout potential, Money Train Origins Dream Drop is an entertaining slot game for Wild West fans. Relax Gaming delivers an excellent design with high-quality graphics and sound effects. The game's multiple high-value bonus symbols and free spins feature keep players engaged throughout the game. However, the low theoretical return to player (RTP) is something to consider when playing the game.\n\n        \n            ",

After the first chapter, set in the 19th century in Mississippi or thereabouts, the other episodes were infused with steampunk veins, creating futuristic games but never forgetting the main theme. With Money Train Origins Dream Drop, we go back to the origins, like in a hypothetical circle that closes. \n\nAs soon as we load the game, we are presented with the characters and the setting, as if we were in front of an animated film and not a slot. \n\nThe game grid is set in a train car from which rifles, knives, and guns protrude from the slots, and the symbols have a very high definition. For example, the playing card suits seem to be in relief thanks to shading and color differences. \n\nGame features\n\nRelax Gaming has opted for a classic game grid with 5 reels and 4 rows on which 40 fixed paylines reside. The bet starts at 0.20 virtual coins, and you can win a sum equal to 10,000 times your bet. Among the game options, we find the Quick Spin button, which speeds up the fall of the symbols, and the Autoplay button, which allows you to set from 5 to 1,000 automatic spins. \n\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is quite low, being equal to 94%. \n\nHow to win at Money Train Origins Dream Drop\n\nThe aim of the game is naturally to match as many identical symbols as possible on an active payline. As for the basic symbols, there are 8 divided equally between high and low-value ones. The first group includes the playing card suits, namely diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades. More remunerative are the symbols belonging to the second group, represented by the four characters. To clearly know the value of each of them, we recommend taking a look at the payments table found within the menu. \n\nThe knife is our Wild and has a truly special function because, in addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, it pays out as much as the highest value symbol. \n\nThe first Bonus we encounter is the Dream Drop, introduced by the exploding dynamite. On the grid, we will only see golden DD symbols land, but hay bales may also arrive. In that case, the function is not activated. Once the grid is full, all we have to do is click on the symbols to reveal the jackpot. If you find three identical ones, the sum is paid out. \n\nThe safe is another Bonus symbol, and when three of them land on the reels, they reward with as many respins that are reactivated with each special symbol. Filling a column with a special symbol adds a reel. \n\nHere are the extra symbols that can land: \n\nBonus Symbol: It's a multiplier ranging from 1x to 10x \nCollector: It appropriates the value of all the symbols present at that moment and adds it to its value \nPayer: Applies a multiplier to all symbols \nBanker: Offers a multiplier that applies to all present and future symbols \nHealer: Ensures that the symbols remain on the reels for the number of spins indicated by the symbol \nPersistent Collector: Collects all prizes and adds them at the end of the current spin and in future ones \nPersistent Payer: Reveals a multiplier and adds it to present and future symbols.\n\nIf all positions are filled without using the Healer, you win a prize equal to 1,000x your bet! \n\nFAQs.\n            ",

After the first chapter, set in the 19th century in Mississippi or thereabouts, the other episodes were infused with steampunk veins, creating futuristic games but never forgetting the main theme. With Money Train Origins Dream Drop, we go back to the origins, like in a hypothetical circle that closes. \n\nAs soon as we load the game, we are presented with the characters and the setting, as if we were in front of an animated film and not a slot. \n\nThe game grid is set in a train car from which rifles, knives, and guns protrude from the slots, and the symbols have a very high definition. For example, the playing card suits seem to be in relief thanks to shading and color differences. \n\nGame features\n\nRelax Gaming has opted for a classic game grid with 5 reels and 4 rows on which 40 fixed paylines reside. The bet starts at 0.20 virtual coins, and you can win a sum equal to 10,000 times your bet. Among the game options, we find the Quick Spin button, which speeds up the fall of the symbols, and the Autoplay button, which allows you to set from 5 to 1,000 automatic spins. \n\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is quite low, being equal to 94%. \n\nHow to win at Money Train Origins Dream Drop\n\nThe aim of the game is naturally to match as many identical symbols as possible on an active payline. As for the basic symbols, there are 8 divided equally between high and low-value ones. The first group includes the playing card suits, namely diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades. More remunerative are the symbols belonging to the second group, represented by the four characters. To clearly know the value of each of them, we recommend taking a look at the payments table found within the menu. \n\nThe knife is our Wild and has a truly special function because, in addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, it pays out as much as the highest value symbol. \n\nThe first Bonus we encounter is the Dream Drop, introduced by the exploding dynamite. On the grid, we will only see golden DD symbols land, but hay bales may also arrive. In that case, the function is not activated. Once the grid is full, all we have to do is click on the symbols to reveal the jackpot. If you find three identical ones, the sum is paid out. \n\nThe safe is another Bonus symbol, and when three of them land on the reels, they reward with as many respins that are reactivated with each special symbol. Filling a column with a special symbol adds a reel. \n\nHere are the extra symbols that can land: \n\nBonus Symbol: It's a multiplier ranging from 1x to 10x \nCollector: It appropriates the value of all the symbols present at that moment and adds it to its value \nPayer: Applies a multiplier to all symbols \nBanker: Offers a multiplier that applies to all present and future symbols \nHealer: Ensures that the symbols remain on the reels for the number of spins indicated by the symbol \nPersistent Collector: Collects all prizes and adds them at the end of the current spin and in future ones \nPersistent Payer: Reveals a multiplier and adds it to present and future symbols.\n\nIf all positions are filled without using the Healer, you win a prize equal to 1,000x your bet! \n\nFAQs.\n            ",
