The 9 to Ace royals belong to the first group, while the demons belong to the second. Anna, at the top of the value scale, rewards up to 500 times your bet. While it takes at least three card symbols to win, the other symbols require only two.

You can bet from a minimum of 0.10 € to a maximum of 100 €. Winning combinations are formed by identical symbols on a payline, starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding right. The game has medium volatility with a theoretical return to the player of 96%, which is average. The lighting button allows you to accelerate the fall of the symbols, while Autoplay enables you to play in automatic mode. \n\nGraphics and Design\n\nThe game's setting is Hell, where our heroine faces off against three terrifying demons. The graphics add an extra dimension to the game, with symbols that are well-defined and an ambiance straight out of a horror film.

It also pays out up to 500 times your bet. The wild also functions as the scatter and triggers free spins. In addition, the inferno book may randomly appear at the center of the screen, and a symbol will be selected and marked with a frame in the next spin. If the wild contributes to a combo with the marked symbol in the next spin, it will expand to the entire reel, resulting in very high payouts. The Free Spins feature can be purchased for 125 times your bet.\n\n        \n            ",

The other star of the show is the book, also known from other Quickspin titles such as Book of Duat.\n\nAs the title suggests, the setting is Hell, where our heroine must face off against three truly terrifying demons, all expertly drawn by the provider's graphic team. The graphics add an extra dimension to the game, with well-defined symbols and an ambiance straight out of a horror film. The game board has an iron frame with two demon statues on either side and a pile of skulls at the bottom, against a background of incandescent lava flowing across the screen.\n\nTraditional Gameplay\n\nThe game board takes a classic form, with 5 reels and 3 rows and 10 fixed paylines, on which you can bet from a minimum of 0.10 € to a maximum of 100 €. The maximum payout rewards up to 5,846 times your bet. Winning combinations are formed by identical symbols on a payline, starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding right.\n\nThe lightning button accelerates the fall of the symbols, while Autoplay allows you to play in automatic mode. With medium volatility, there's a good balance between spins and winnings, and a theoretical return to the player of 96%, which is average.\n\nSymbols of Book of Inferno\n\nNow, let's talk about the symbols, which fall into low-, mid-, and high-value categories. The 9 to Ace royals belong to the first group, while the demons belong to the second. Anna, at the top of the value scale, rewards up to 500 times your bet. While it takes at least three card symbols to win, the other symbols require only two. For a detailed breakdown of the value of each icon, consult the paytable.\n\nThe wild symbol is the book itself and serves as the usual wildcard, replacing all regular symbols. It also pays out up to 500 times your bet. The wild also functions as the scatter and triggers free spins. In addition, the inferno book may randomly appear at the center of the screen, and a symbol will be selected and marked with a frame in the next spin. If the wild contributes to a combo with the marked symbol in the next spin, it will expand to the entire reel, resulting in very high payouts.\n\nThe Free Spins feature can be purchased for 125 times your bet.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I play Book of Inferno on my tablet?\n\nCertainly! As an HTML5 version, this game is available on all mobile devices and operating systems.\n\nWhat is the maximum payout of Book of Inferno?\n\nWith Book of Inferno, you can win up to 5,846 times your bet.\n\nWhere can I find Book of Inferno?\n\nBook of Inferno can be played at all legal online casinos.\n        ",
