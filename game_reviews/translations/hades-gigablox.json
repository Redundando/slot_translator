In base al valore assegnato al gettone si può ricavare il range totale di scommesse, da un minimo di 10 centesimi a giro fino a un massimo di 100 € se si assegna il valore più alto al gettone e si punta su tutte le 50 linee di pagamento.\nQuesta fantastica slot machine di casa Yggdrasil è caratterizzata da una volatilità media, che prevede quindi sia premi di basso valore abbastanza costanti, sia vincite più alte, per ottenere  le quali però bisognerà avere un pochino di pazienza.\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP) di Hades: Gigablox si attesta su un 96 % perfettamente nella media della maggior parte dei giochi di slot.\nIl gioco può essere impostato anche in Autoplay, che permette di far girare da sé i rulli.\nSimboli di Hades: Gigablox\nSu Hades: Gigablox oltre ai simboli rappresentanti i quattro semi delle carte da gioco, che sono anche le icone con valore minore, abbiamo una carrellata di demoni e figure della mitologia greca legata al mondo dell’oltretomba, tra cui il Minotauro, le Arpie, il ciclope, li serpente, nonché il re degli Inferi Ade e Cerbero, il leggendario cane a tre teste.\nTra le funzioni speciali troviamo la possibilità di trasformare un certo numero di simboli regolari in icone Wild, che permetteranno di aumentare il numero delle combinazioni vincenti.\n",

The images in Hades: Gigablox are beautiful, with dark tones and a themed soundtrack that make the player feel like they're in a dark adventure. The innovative and decidedly non-trivial gameplay makes the game exciting, with excellent winning possibilities.\n\nEach creature is represented in detail, with Hades himself coming to life on the right side of the grid, framed by columns of damned souls, eerie skulls and snakes, and with the flames of hell igniting the screen from the bottom.\n\nHades: Gigablox can be played on your computer but is also optimized for any type of mobile device and also in Play for Fun version, if you want to have fun without investing a penny and without the need for any registration.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nAt first glance, Hades: Gigablox appears as a somewhat anomalous slot machine: instead of the classic 5x3 grid, we find a 6x6 one, but there's more! The innovative Gigablox mechanic provides that symbols can become giant, covering internal blocks, even the entire grid.\n\nHades: Gigablox has several betting options, which can be set by choosing the value of the token, between 0.002 and 2 €. Based on the value assigned to the token, you can derive the total range of bets, from a minimum of 10 cents per spin up to a maximum of 100 € if you assign the highest value to the token and bet on all 50 paylines.\n\nThis fantastic slot machine from Yggdrasil is characterized by medium volatility, which therefore provides both constant low-value prizes and higher winnings, for which however you will need a little patience.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player (return to player or RTP) of Hades: Gigablox is 96%, perfectly in line with most slot machine games.\n\nThe game can also be set in Autoplay, which allows the reels to spin on their own.\n\nSymbols of Hades: Gigablox\nIn addition to symbols representing the four playing card suits, which are also the icons with the lowest value, Hades: Gigablox features a range of demons and figures from Greek mythology related to the underworld, including the Minotaur, Harpies, Cyclops, snakes, as well as the king of the underworld, Hades himself, and Cerberus, the legendary three-headed dog.\n\nAmong the special functions, we find the possibility of transforming a certain number of regular symbols into Wild icons, which will allow increasing the number of winning combinations.\n            ",

With Hades: Gigablox, we find ourselves in front of a game that honors the provider's name, offering an astonishing gaming experience.\n\nLet's start with the theme: we are in the underworld, the realm of the dead populated by demonic creatures that come to life on the reels thanks to computer-designed 3D graphics. The images in Hades: Gigablox are beautiful, with dark tones and a themed soundtrack that make the player feel like they're in a dark adventure. The innovative and decidedly non-trivial gameplay makes the game exciting, with excellent winning possibilities.\n\nEach creature is represented in detail, with Hades himself coming to life on the right side of the grid, framed by columns of damned souls, eerie skulls and snakes, and with the flames of hell igniting the screen from the bottom.\n\nHades: Gigablox can be played on your computer but is also optimized for any type of mobile device and also in Play for Fun version, if you want to have fun without investing a penny and without the need for any registration.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nAt first glance, Hades: Gigablox appears as a somewhat anomalous slot machine: instead of the classic 5x3 grid, we find a 6x6 one, but there's more! The innovative Gigablox mechanic provides that symbols can become giant, covering internal blocks, even the entire grid.\n\nHades: Gigablox has several betting options, which can be set by choosing the value of the token, between 0.002 and 2 €. Based on the value assigned to the token, you can derive the total range of bets, from a minimum of 10 cents per spin up to a maximum of 100 € if you assign the highest value to the token and bet on all 50 paylines.\n\nThis fantastic slot machine from Yggdrasil is characterized by medium volatility, which therefore provides both constant low-value prizes and higher winnings, for which however you will need a little patience.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player (return to player or RTP) of Hades: Gigablox is 96%, perfectly in line with most slot machine games.\n\nThe game can also be set in Autoplay, which allows the reels to spin on their own.\n\nSymbols of Hades: Gigablox\nIn addition to symbols representing the four playing card suits, which are also the icons with the lowest value, Hades: Gigablox features a range of demons and figures from Greek mythology related to the underworld, including the Minotaur, Harpies, Cyclops, snakes, as well as the king of the underworld, Hades himself, and Cerberus, the legendary three-headed dog.\n\nAmong the special functions, we find the possibility of transforming a certain number of regular symbols into Wild icons, which will allow increasing the number of winning combinations.\n            ",
