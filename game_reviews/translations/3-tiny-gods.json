This thrilling video slot boasts 5 reels, 4 rows, and 30 paylines for you to try and hit the jackpot. But 3 Tiny Gods isn't your average Egyptian-themed game - it offers unique features that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Get ready for an unforgettable experience!\n\nGameplay of 3 Tiny Gods\n\nWith an RTP of approximately 96.40%, 3 Tiny Gods is a medium-variance video slot, with a betting range starting at €0.10 up to €50. Players can also use the Foxify feature to increase their stake and activate special functions. The game includes a free mode that lets players test its features without spending real money. You'll have access to three different reel modifiers (Wrath of Anubis, The Gift of Bastet, and Mystery of Horus), a jackpot bonus game, and a free spins function. The Gods Anubis, Bastet, and Horus, as well as Cleopatra and Tutankhamun, will accompany you on your journey and create a unique Egyptian experience.\n\nScatter and Wild Symbols in 3 Tiny Gods\n\nWild Symbol\n\nThe golden game logo represents the game's Wild symbol and can be included in a range of winning combinations as it can replace all other icons except for the Scatter. It also pays out the most of all the symbols on the paytable, offering up to 100 times your bet per line.\n\nScatter Symbol\n\nThe BONUS symbol functions as the Scatter in Foxium's 3 Tiny Gods slot game. When it appears on reels 1, 3, and 5, it triggers the Anubis' Wrath bonus.\n\nWhat Bonus Features does 3 Tiny Gods have?\n\nGet ready for an exciting range of bonus features in 3 Tiny Gods, some of which are optional while others are integral to the game:\n\nOne of the optional features to look out for in 3 Tiny Gods is Foxify, which increases your chances of activating the Mystery of Horus feature and the free spins bonus. It costs 50% more to use than your usual bet.\n\nThe Gift of Bastet is a randomly activated bonus in 3 Tiny Gods, and can only be assigned after a non-winning spin. It rearranges the currently displayed symbols on the reels to try and create a winning combination.\n\nThe Mystery of Horus bonus can be assigned to any base game spin and adds stacks of Egyptian God Horus symbols to 2 or 3 reels, which then transform into matching symbols (including Wilds).\n\nThe Free Spins bonus is unlocked when the Scatter symbol stops on reels 1, 3, and 5 of the same spin. You'll receive 8 free spins, but Anubis can grant you extras. Anubis can also remove some of the lower-value symbols, giving you a better chance of scoring big wins. The Mystery of Horus feature is also active during this round.\n\nThe Jackpot Bonus in the 3 Tiny Gods slot game is activated when you collect enough golden coin symbols in the meter at the top of the screen. You'll get a series of spins during which you must try and uncover three matching jackpot symbols. The jackpots are Mini (15x your bet), Midi (100x your bet), and Maxi (5,000x your bet).\n\nVerdict on 3 Tiny Gods\n\nIf you've played the Boom Pirates game before spinning the reels of this slot, the adrenaline might be lower, but the features are incredibly entertaining and with a potential payout of up to 5,000 times your bet, I consider 3 Tiny Gods to be a good option for players who enjoy the Egyptian theme. With its medium volatility and juicy RTP, 3 Tiny Gods is perfectly suited to players who want to play with the same slot for a while. There's only one way to hit the jackpot of 5,000 times your stake, and that's by hitting the Maxi Jackpot, but before that, you'll experience a journey full of surprises. If you love online slots with an Ancient Egypt theme, I recommend Barcrest's Legend of the Pharaohs, which is jam-packed with special features, just like we like it!\n\nFAQ for 3 Tiny Gods\n\nWhere can I try the 3 Tiny Gods slot machine for free?\n\nRight here on SlotJava.

It's a medium/high volatility game, which means that you'll find a middle ground between many small and frequent payouts, and rare but substantial wins.\n\nHow much can I win per spin?\n\nFoxium claims that it's possible for players to win up to 5,000 times their bet per spin. While it's highly unlikely that we'll ever see that level of potential coming from a game's 1,000 bet wins, it might be possible during the bonus round.",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"3 Tiny Gods\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nExperience the mystical land of Egypt with 3 Tiny Gods, the slot game from Foxium (Microgaming)! This thrilling video slot boasts 5 reels, 4 rows, and 30 paylines for you to try and hit the jackpot. But 3 Tiny Gods isn't your average Egyptian-themed game - it offers unique features that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Get ready for an unforgettable experience!\n\nGameplay of 3 Tiny Gods\n\nWith an RTP of approximately 96.40%, 3 Tiny Gods is a medium-variance video slot, with a betting range starting at €0.10 up to €50. Players can also use the Foxify feature to increase their stake and activate special functions. The game includes a free mode that lets players test its features without spending real money. You'll have access to three different reel modifiers (Wrath of Anubis, The Gift of Bastet, and Mystery of Horus), a jackpot bonus game, and a free spins function. The Gods Anubis, Bastet, and Horus, as well as Cleopatra and Tutankhamun, will accompany you on your journey and create a unique Egyptian experience.\n\nScatter and Wild Symbols in 3 Tiny Gods\n\nWild Symbol\n\nThe golden game logo represents the game's Wild symbol and can be included in a range of winning combinations as it can replace all other icons except for the Scatter. It also pays out the most of all the symbols on the paytable, offering up to 100 times your bet per line.\n\nScatter Symbol\n\nThe BONUS symbol functions as the Scatter in Foxium's 3 Tiny Gods slot game. When it appears on reels 1, 3, and 5, it triggers the Anubis' Wrath bonus.\n\nWhat Bonus Features does 3 Tiny Gods have?\n\nGet ready for an exciting range of bonus features in 3 Tiny Gods, some of which are optional while others are integral to the game:\n\nOne of the optional features to look out for in 3 Tiny Gods is Foxify, which increases your chances of activating the Mystery of Horus feature and the free spins bonus. It costs 50% more to use than your usual bet.\n\nThe Gift of Bastet is a randomly activated bonus in 3 Tiny Gods, and can only be assigned after a non-winning spin. It rearranges the currently displayed symbols on the reels to try and create a winning combination.\n\nThe Mystery of Horus bonus can be assigned to any base game spin and adds stacks of Egyptian God Horus symbols to 2 or 3 reels, which then transform into matching symbols (including Wilds).\n\nThe Free Spins bonus is unlocked when the Scatter symbol stops on reels 1, 3, and 5 of the same spin. You'll receive 8 free spins, but Anubis can grant you extras. Anubis can also remove some of the lower-value symbols, giving you a better chance of scoring big wins. The Mystery of Horus feature is also active during this round.\n\nThe Jackpot Bonus in the 3 Tiny Gods slot game is activated when you collect enough golden coin symbols in the meter at the top of the screen. You'll get a series of spins during which you must try and uncover three matching jackpot symbols. The jackpots are Mini (15x your bet), Midi (100x your bet), and Maxi (5,000x your bet).\n\nVerdict on 3 Tiny Gods\n\nIf you've played the Boom Pirates game before spinning the reels of this slot, the adrenaline might be lower, but the features are incredibly entertaining and with a potential payout of up to 5,000 times your bet, I consider 3 Tiny Gods to be a good option for players who enjoy the Egyptian theme. With its medium volatility and juicy RTP, 3 Tiny Gods is perfectly suited to players who want to play with the same slot for a while. There's only one way to hit the jackpot of 5,000 times your stake, and that's by hitting the Maxi Jackpot, but before that, you'll experience a journey full of surprises. If you love online slots with an Ancient Egypt theme, I recommend Barcrest's Legend of the Pharaohs, which is jam-packed with special features, just like we like it!\n\nFAQ for 3 Tiny Gods\n\nWhere can I try the 3 Tiny Gods slot machine for free?\n\nRight here on SlotJava.

This thrilling video slot boasts 5 reels, 4 rows, and 30 paylines for you to try and hit the jackpot. But 3 Tiny Gods isn't your average Egyptian-themed game - it offers unique features that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Get ready for an unforgettable experience!\n\nGameplay of 3 Tiny Gods\n\nWith an RTP of approximately 96.40%, 3 Tiny Gods is a medium-variance video slot, with a betting range starting at €0.10 up to €50. Players can also use the Foxify feature to increase their stake and activate special functions. The game includes a free mode that lets players test its features without spending real money. You'll have access to three different reel modifiers (Wrath of Anubis, The Gift of Bastet, and Mystery of Horus), a jackpot bonus game, and a free spins function. The Gods Anubis, Bastet, and Horus, as well as Cleopatra and Tutankhamun, will accompany you on your journey and create a unique Egyptian experience.\n\nScatter and Wild Symbols in 3 Tiny Gods\n\nWild Symbol\n\nThe golden game logo represents the game's Wild symbol and can be included in a range of winning combinations as it can replace all other icons except for the Scatter. It also pays out the most of all the symbols on the paytable, offering up to 100 times your bet per line.\n\nScatter Symbol\n\nThe BONUS symbol functions as the Scatter in Foxium's 3 Tiny Gods slot game. When it appears on reels 1, 3, and 5, it triggers the Anubis' Wrath bonus.\n\nWhat Bonus Features does 3 Tiny Gods have?\n\nGet ready for an exciting range of bonus features in 3 Tiny Gods, some of which are optional while others are integral to the game:\n\nOne of the optional features to look out for in 3 Tiny Gods is Foxify, which increases your chances of activating the Mystery of Horus feature and the free spins bonus. It costs 50% more to use than your usual bet.\n\nThe Gift of Bastet is a randomly activated bonus in 3 Tiny Gods, and can only be assigned after a non-winning spin. It rearranges the currently displayed symbols on the reels to try and create a winning combination.\n\nThe Mystery of Horus bonus can be assigned to any base game spin and adds stacks of Egyptian God Horus symbols to 2 or 3 reels, which then transform into matching symbols (including Wilds).\n\nThe Free Spins bonus is unlocked when the Scatter symbol stops on reels 1, 3, and 5 of the same spin. You'll receive 8 free spins, but Anubis can grant you extras. Anubis can also remove some of the lower-value symbols, giving you a better chance of scoring big wins. The Mystery of Horus feature is also active during this round.\n\nThe Jackpot Bonus in the 3 Tiny Gods slot game is activated when you collect enough golden coin symbols in the meter at the top of the screen. You'll get a series of spins during which you must try and uncover three matching jackpot symbols. The jackpots are Mini (15x your bet), Midi (100x your bet), and Maxi (5,000x your bet).\n\nVerdict on 3 Tiny Gods\n\nIf you've played the Boom Pirates game before spinning the reels of this slot, the adrenaline might be lower, but the features are incredibly entertaining and with a potential payout of up to 5,000 times your bet, I consider 3 Tiny Gods to be a good option for players who enjoy the Egyptian theme. With its medium volatility and juicy RTP, 3 Tiny Gods is perfectly suited to players who want to play with the same slot for a while. There's only one way to hit the jackpot of 5,000 times your stake, and that's by hitting the Maxi Jackpot, but before that, you'll experience a journey full of surprises. If you love online slots with an Ancient Egypt theme, I recommend Barcrest's Legend of the Pharaohs, which is jam-packed with special features, just like we like it!\n\nFAQ for 3 Tiny Gods\n\nWhere can I try the 3 Tiny Gods slot machine for free?\n\nRight here on SlotJava. If you want to try the 3 Tiny Gods online slot for free, our demo is the perfect place to start. No download is required.\n\nWhat is the safest casino to play the 3 Tiny Gods online slot at?\n\nIf you want to be sure that your information is safe when playing the 3 Tiny Gods slot game, choosing from our list of secure casinos might be a good option.\n\nWhat is the RTP of 3 Tiny Gods?\n\nThe RTP of 3 Tiny Gods is set at 96.4%. It's a medium/high volatility game, which means that you'll find a middle ground between many small and frequent payouts, and rare but substantial wins.\n\nHow much can I win per spin?\n\nFoxium claims that it's possible for players to win up to 5,000 times their bet per spin. While it's highly unlikely that we'll ever see that level of potential coming from a game's 1,000 bet wins, it might be possible during the bonus round.\n            ",

Players can also use the Foxify feature to increase their stake and activate special functions. The game includes a free mode that lets players test its features without spending real money. You'll have access to three different reel modifiers, a jackpot bonus game, and a free spins function.\n\nScatter and Wild Symbols in 3 Tiny Gods\n\nThe golden game logo represents the game's Wild symbol and can be included in a range of winning combinations as it can replace all other icons except for the Scatter. It also pays out the most of all the symbols on the paytable, offering up to 100 times your bet per line. The BONUS symbol functions as the Scatter in Foxium's 3 Tiny Gods slot game. When it appears on reels 1, 3, and 5, it triggers the Anubis' Wrath bonus.\n\nBonus Features in 3 Tiny Gods\n\nOne of the optional features to look out for in 3 Tiny Gods is Foxify, which increases your chances of activating the Mystery of Horus feature and the free spins bonus. It costs 50% more to use than your usual bet. The Gift of Bastet is a randomly activated bonus in 3 Tiny Gods, and can only be assigned after a non-winning spin. The Mystery of Horus bonus can be assigned to any base game spin and adds stacks of Egyptian God Horus symbols to 2 or 3 reels, which then transform into matching symbols (including Wilds). The Free Spins bonus is unlocked when the Scatter symbol stops on reels 1, 3, and 5 of the same spin. You'll receive 8 free spins, but Anubis can grant you extras. Anubis can also remove some of the lower-value symbols, giving you a better chance of scoring big wins. The Mystery of Horus feature is also active during this round. The Jackpot Bonus in the 3 Tiny Gods slot game is activated when you collect enough golden coin symbols in the meter at the top of the screen. You'll get a series of spins during which you must try and uncover three matching jackpot symbols. The jackpots are Mini (15x your bet), Midi (100x your bet), and Maxi (5,000x your bet).\n\nTheme and Setting\n\nThe Egyptian-themed slot game, 3 Tiny Gods, takes you on an exciting journey where three Egyptian gods, Anubis, Bastet, and Horus, as well as Cleopatra and Tutankhamun, will accompany you throughout the game. The reels are set against a background of ancient Egypt, with graphics and imagery that evoke the magic and mystery of the land.\n\nReel Modifiers\n\n3 Tiny Gods has three reel modifiers: Wrath of Anubis, The Gift of Bastet, and Mystery of Horus. These modifiers offer players unique gameplay experiences and can be triggered during any base game spin or a non-winning spin.\n\nJackpot Bonus Game\n\nThe Jackpot Bonus in the 3 Tiny Gods slot game is an exciting feature that can be activated by collecting enough golden coin symbols in the meter at the top of the screen. Players must then attempt to uncover three matching jackpot symbols. The jackpots are Mini (15x your bet), Midi (100x your bet), and Maxi (5,000x your bet).\n\nFree Spins Function\n\n3 Tiny Gods' Free Spins bonus is unlocked when the Scatter symbol stops on reels 1, 3, and 5 of the same spin. You'll receive 8 free spins, but Anubis can grant you extras. Anubis can also remove some of the lower-value symbols, giving you a better chance of scoring big wins. The Mystery of Horus feature is also active during this round.\n\nFoxify Feature\n\nThe optional Foxify feature in 3 Tiny Gods gives players the chance to increase their stake by 50% and activate special functions, increasing their chances of activating the Mystery of Horus feature and the free spins bonus.\n\nComparison with Similar Slot Games\n\nIf you enjoy online slots with an Ancient Egypt theme, we recommend Barcrest's Legend of the Pharaohs, which is packed with special features. However, 3 Tiny Gods has unique gameplay features and mechanics, such as the Foxify feature, the Gift of Bastet, and the reel modifiers that make it a thrilling video slot with a potential payout of up to 5,000 times your bet per spin.\n\n        \n            ",

When it appears on reels 1, 3, and 5, it triggers the Anubis' Wrath bonus.\n\nWhat Bonus Features does 3 Tiny Gods have?\n\nGet ready for an exciting range of bonus features in 3 Tiny Gods, some of which are optional while others are integral to the game:\n\nOne of the optional features to look out for in 3 Tiny Gods is Foxify, which increases your chances of activating the Mystery of Horus feature and the free spins bonus. It costs 50% more to use than your usual bet.\n\nThe Gift of Bastet is a randomly activated bonus in 3 Tiny Gods, and can only be assigned after a non-winning spin. It rearranges the currently displayed symbols on the reels to try and create a winning combination.\n\nThe Mystery of Horus bonus can be assigned to any base game spin and adds stacks of Egyptian God Horus symbols to 2 or 3 reels, which then transform into matching symbols (including Wilds).\n\nThe Free Spins bonus is unlocked when the Scatter symbol stops on reels 1, 3, and 5 of the same spin. You'll receive 8 free spins, but Anubis can grant you extras. Anubis can also remove some of the lower-value symbols, giving you a better chance of scoring big wins. The Mystery of Horus feature is also active during this round.\n\nThe Jackpot Bonus in the 3 Tiny Gods slot game is activated when you collect enough golden coin symbols in the meter at the top of the screen. You'll get a series of spins during which you must try and uncover three matching jackpot symbols. The jackpots are Mini (15x your bet), Midi (100x your bet), and Maxi (5,000x your bet).\n\nVerdict on 3 Tiny Gods\n\nIf you've played the Boom Pirates game before spinning the reels of this slot, the adrenaline might be lower, but the features are incredibly entertaining and with a potential payout of up to 5,000 times your bet, I consider 3 Tiny Gods to be a good option for players who enjoy the Egyptian theme. With its medium volatility and juicy RTP, 3 Tiny Gods is perfectly suited to players who want to play with the same slot for a while. There's only one way to hit the jackpot of 5,000 times your stake, and that's by hitting the Maxi Jackpot, but before that, you'll experience a journey full of surprises. If you love online slots with an Ancient Egypt theme, I recommend Barcrest's Legend of the Pharaohs, which is jam-packed with special features, just like we like it!\n\nFAQ for 3 Tiny Gods\n\nWhere can I try the 3 Tiny Gods slot machine for free?\n\nRight here on SlotJava. If you want to try the 3 Tiny Gods online slot for free, our demo is the perfect place to start. No download is required.\n\nWhat is the safest casino to play the 3 Tiny Gods online slot at?\n\nIf you want to be sure that your information is safe when playing the 3 Tiny Gods slot game, choosing from our list of secure casinos might be a good option.\n\nWhat is the RTP of 3 Tiny Gods?\n\nThe RTP of 3 Tiny Gods is set at 96.4%. It's a medium/high volatility game, which means that you'll find a middle ground between many small and frequent payouts, and rare but substantial wins.\n\nHow much can I win per spin?\n\nFoxium claims that it's possible for players to win up to 5,000 times their bet per spin. While it's highly unlikely that we'll ever see that level of potential coming from a game's 1,000 bet wins, it might be possible during the bonus round.\n            ",

The image should be in cartoon style and feature a happy Maya warrior with glasses, as specified in the prompt. The background should look like a desert, with pyramids and palm trees visible. In the foreground, the Maya warrior should stand on the left side of the image, with Anubis, Bastet, and Horus standing on the right. The gods should be shown with their unique symbols or attributes, like Anubis' jackal head, Bastet's cat ears, and Horus' falcon head. The game's logo should also be featured prominently. The colors used in the image should be bright and vibrant, to reflect the game's fun and exciting features."
