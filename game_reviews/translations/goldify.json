Goldify is inspired by the myth of King Midas, and how everything he touched turned to gold. This sparkling game will entertain and engage you from the very first spin. This glorious Greek-themed game will allow you to enjoy the golden touch for yourself, and IGT has done everything to make sure you can play to your heart's content. Immersive from the first roll of the reels, this IGT slot game will make you feel like a Greek god or goddess, anywhere and everywhere you play!\n\nMythological graphics\nIGT is well-known for its graphics-rich online slots, and this one is no exception. The style is a bit simplistic and some might say old-fashioned, but this makes it even more appealing, as the game is easy to play and makes you feel like you're on the floor of a Las Vegas casino. This could easily be a land-based video slot, only it has been completely modernized. The comparison with land machines is not too far-fetched, as IGT also creates incredible games for brick-and-mortar casinos, so it's not hard to imagine that this also influences their online and mobile versions.\nThe reels are set against an intense orange background and are flanked by typically Greek columns on both sides. Instead of navigation and control buttons that are usually found at the bottom of the reels, they are placed on the sides, but this doesn't make too much of a difference, and some might say that it even makes the game a bit easier.\nOn the reels, there is an assortment of well-designed symbols that are all connected to the theme. There are apples, columns, a silver-sealed ring, a harp, a gladiator helmet, the winged horse Pegasus, and a Greek woman. Of course, there is also King Midas, who takes on the role of the game's wild, while the scatter is a rose that King Midas touches with his golden touch.\n\nSlot Machine features and symbols\nHowever, something that is unique in this casino slot is the option to gild the symbols. The player can choose to transform one of the symbols into the golden version of the same symbol. If a winning combination is hit, this symbol will pay 5 times more. You can choose to turn the lower-paying symbols into gold, which appear more often on the reels, or you can be patient and choose the higher-value ones and wait for the jackpots.\nWhen it comes to additional features, IGT has provided us with more than acceptable ones.\nThe King Midas symbol itself acts as a wild. Therefore, it can substitute for any other symbol except the golden rose.\nBonus. The golden rose is a symbol for the bonus round. To win free spins, you need three to five golden roses to appear on the reels. When they appear, you get 15, 50, or 100 free spins depending on how many golden roses you've obtained. Not only that, but the player is also encouraged to transform three, four, or five other symbols into gold during the free spins. What's more, more can be recovered.\nThe payout range is slightly below average. You will need to play around to win and be as cautious as possible. However, it still offers a decent payback rate.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you are passionate about the history of this famous ruler, then we can only suggest that you also play King Midas, the slot machine produced by Octavian Gaming, which allows you to win up to €300 on a single play.

Naturalmente c’è anche re Mida, che prende la forma del Wild del gioco, mentre lo Scatter è una rosa a cui re Mida applica il suo tocco d’oro.\n\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nTuttavia, qualcosa che è unico in questa slot del casinò è l’opzione di doratura dei simboli. Il giocatore può scegliere di trasformare uno dei simboli nella versione dorata dello stesso simbolo. Se la combinazione vincente viene colpita, questo simbolo pagherà 5 volte di più. Si può scegliere di trasformare i simboli meno pagati in oro, che appaiono più spesso sui rulli, oppure si può essere pazienti e scegliere quelli di valore più alto e aspettare i jackpot.\nQuando si tratta di funzionalità aggiuntive, IGT ci ha fornito caratteristiche più che accettabili.\nIl simbolo del re Mida stesso agisce come un Wild. Pertanto, può sostituire qualsiasi altro simbolo, tranne la rosa dorata.\nBonus. La rosa dorata è un simbolo per il bonus round. Per vincere i giri gratis, è necessario che sui rulli appaiano da tre a cinque rose d’oro. Quando appaiono, si ottengono 15, 50 o 100 giri gratis dipende da quante rose dorate hai ottenuto. Non solo, ma il giocatore è anche incoraggiato a trasformarsi in altri tre, quattro o cinque simboli d’oro durante i giri gratuiti. Cosa c’è, ancora di più, può essere recuperato.\nIl range di payout è un po’ al di sotto della media. Dovrete giocarci intorno per vincere ed essere il più prudenti possibile. Tuttavia, offre comunque un tasso di payback decente.\n\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nSe sei appassionato alla storia di questo famoso sovrano, allora non possiamo che suggerirti di giocare anche a Re Mida, la Slot Machine prodotta da Octavian Gaming, che ti permette di vincere fino a 300€ sulla singola giocata.

Goldify is inspired by the myth of King Midas, and how everything he touched turned to gold. This sparkling game will entertain and engage you from the very first spin. This glorious Greek-themed game will allow you to enjoy the golden touch for yourself, and IGT has done everything to make sure you can play to your heart's content. Immersive from the first roll of the reels, this IGT slot game will make you feel like a Greek god or goddess, anywhere and everywhere you play!\n\nMythological graphics\nIGT is well-known for its graphics-rich online slots, and this one is no exception. The style is a bit simplistic and some might say old-fashioned, but this makes it even more appealing, as the game is easy to play and makes you feel like you're on the floor of a Las Vegas casino. This could easily be a land-based video slot, only it has been completely modernized. The comparison with land machines is not too far-fetched, as IGT also creates incredible games for brick-and-mortar casinos, so it's not hard to imagine that this also influences their online and mobile versions.\nThe reels are set against an intense orange background and are flanked by typically Greek columns on both sides. Instead of navigation and control buttons that are usually found at the bottom of the reels, they are placed on the sides, but this doesn't make too much of a difference, and some might say that it even makes the game a bit easier.\nOn the reels, there is an assortment of well-designed symbols that are all connected to the theme. There are apples, columns, a silver-sealed ring, a harp, a gladiator helmet, the winged horse Pegasus, and a Greek woman. Of course, there is also King Midas, who takes on the role of the game's wild, while the scatter is a rose that King Midas touches with his golden touch.\n\nSlot Machine features and symbols\nHowever, something that is unique in this casino slot is the option to gild the symbols. The player can choose to transform one of the symbols into the golden version of the same symbol. If a winning combination is hit, this symbol will pay 5 times more. You can choose to turn the lower-paying symbols into gold, which appear more often on the reels, or you can be patient and choose the higher-value ones and wait for the jackpots.\nWhen it comes to additional features, IGT has provided us with more than acceptable ones.\nThe King Midas symbol itself acts as a wild. Therefore, it can substitute for any other symbol except the golden rose.\nBonus. The golden rose is a symbol for the bonus round. To win free spins, you need three to five golden roses to appear on the reels. When they appear, you get 15, 50, or 100 free spins depending on how many golden roses you've obtained. Not only that, but the player is also encouraged to transform three, four, or five other symbols into gold during the free spins. What's more, more can be recovered.\nThe payout range is slightly below average. You will need to play around to win and be as cautious as possible. However, it still offers a decent payback rate.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you are passionate about the history of this famous ruler, then we can only suggest that you also play King Midas, the slot machine produced by Octavian Gaming, which allows you to win up to €300 on a single play.

The game also offers a bonus round triggered by the golden rose symbol, where players can win up to 100 free spins. IGT's slot games are known for being graphics-rich, and this one doesn't disappoint. The control buttons are located on the sides of the reels, and the payout range is average.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nThe Greek-themed game features simple yet appealing graphics with well-designed symbols, including King Midas as the wild. The reels are set against a vivid orange background and are flanked by Greek columns on both sides. Although the style is a bit old-fashioned, the game's immersive design makes up for it.\n\nTheme and setting\n\nThe game is inspired by the myth of King Midas and his golden touch, transporting players to Ancient Greece. The symbols on the reels are well-crafted and all connected to the theme, including apples, columns, a silver-sealed ring, a harp, a gladiator helmet, Pegasus, and a Greek woman. The immersive design and Greek-themed elements make Goldify a unique slot game.\n\nPayout and reward system\n\nThe payout range in this game is slightly below average, but it still offers a decent payback rate. The unique symbol gilding feature and the bonus round can result in lucrative payouts, and the wild and scatter symbols offer the potential for big wins.\n\nSoftware provider\n\nGoldify is produced by the well-known online casino game provider IGT. IGT is known for creating graphics-rich games for both online and brick-and-mortar casinos, and they have done an excellent job of modernizing the Goldify slot game whilst maintaining the appeal of traditional video slots.\n\nBonus rounds\n\nThe bonus round in Goldify is triggered by the golden rose symbol, which rewards players with 15, 50, or 100 free spins. During the bonus round, players are encouraged to transform three, four, or five other symbols into gold, increasing the value by 5x. This bonus feature offers the potential for big payouts and adds to the immersive experience of the game.\n\nSymbols and their significance\n\nGoldify features well-designed symbols connected to the game's Ancient Greek theme, including the golden rose, King Midas, Pegasus, a gladiator helmet, a harp, a silver-sealed ring, and more. The wild symbol is King Midas, and the scatter symbol is the golden rose, which triggers the bonus round. Additionally, the unique symbol gilding feature allows players to increase the value of symbols by 5x, offering the potential for lucrative payouts.\n\nComparison with similar slot games\n\nGoldify's similarity to other slot games may lie in its theme. Players interested in the myth of King Midas may also enjoy playing the King Midas slot game produced by Octavian Gaming, which offers the potential to win up to €300 on a single play. However, Goldify stands out with its unique symbol gilding feature and bonus round, which adds to the game's immersive appeal.\n\n        \n            ",

Goldify is inspired by the myth of King Midas, and how everything he touched turned to gold. This sparkling game will entertain and engage you from the very first spin. This glorious Greek-themed game will allow you to enjoy the golden touch for yourself, and IGT has done everything to make sure you can play to your heart's content. Immersive from the first roll of the reels, this IGT slot game will make you feel like a Greek god or goddess, anywhere and everywhere you play!\n\nMythological graphics\nIGT is well-known for its graphics-rich online slots, and this one is no exception. The style is a bit simplistic and some might say old-fashioned, but this makes it even more appealing, as the game is easy to play and makes you feel like you're on the floor of a Las Vegas casino. This could easily be a land-based video slot, only it has been completely modernized. The comparison with land machines is not too far-fetched, as IGT also creates incredible games for brick-and-mortar casinos, so it's not hard to imagine that this also influences their online and mobile versions.\nThe reels are set against an intense orange background and are flanked by typically Greek columns on both sides. Instead of navigation and control buttons that are usually found at the bottom of the reels, they are placed on the sides, but this doesn't make too much of a difference, and some might say that it even makes the game a bit easier.\nOn the reels, there is an assortment of well-designed symbols that are all connected to the theme. There are apples, columns, a silver-sealed ring, a harp, a gladiator helmet, the winged horse Pegasus, and a Greek woman. Of course, there is also King Midas, who takes on the role of the game's wild, while the scatter is a rose that King Midas touches with his golden touch.\n\nSlot Machine features and symbols\nHowever, something that is unique in this casino slot is the option to gild the symbols. The player can choose to transform one of the symbols into the golden version of the same symbol. If a winning combination is hit, this symbol will pay 5 times more. You can choose to turn the lower-paying symbols into gold, which appear more often on the reels, or you can be patient and choose the higher-value ones and wait for the jackpots.\nWhen it comes to additional features, IGT has provided us with more than acceptable ones.\nThe King Midas symbol itself acts as a wild. Therefore, it can substitute for any other symbol except the golden rose.\nBonus. The golden rose is a symbol for the bonus round. To win free spins, you need three to five golden roses to appear on the reels. When they appear, you get 15, 50, or 100 free spins depending on how many golden roses you've obtained. Not only that, but the player is also encouraged to transform three, four, or five other symbols into gold during the free spins. What's more, more can be recovered.\nThe payout range is slightly below average. You will need to play around to win and be as cautious as possible. However, it still offers a decent payback rate.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you are passionate about the history of this famous ruler, then we can only suggest that you also play King Midas, the slot machine produced by Octavian Gaming, which allows you to win up to €300 on a single play.

Goldify is inspired by the myth of King Midas, and how everything he touched turned to gold. This sparkling game will entertain and engage you from the very first spin. This glorious Greek-themed game will allow you to enjoy the golden touch for yourself, and IGT has done everything to make sure you can play to your heart's content. Immersive from the first roll of the reels, this IGT slot game will make you feel like a Greek god or goddess, anywhere and everywhere you play!\n\nMythological graphics\nIGT is well-known for its graphics-rich online slots, and this one is no exception. The style is a bit simplistic and some might say old-fashioned, but this makes it even more appealing, as the game is easy to play and makes you feel like you're on the floor of a Las Vegas casino. This could easily be a land-based video slot, only it has been completely modernized. The comparison with land machines is not too far-fetched, as IGT also creates incredible games for brick-and-mortar casinos, so it's not hard to imagine that this also influences their online and mobile versions.\nThe reels are set against an intense orange background and are flanked by typically Greek columns on both sides. Instead of navigation and control buttons that are usually found at the bottom of the reels, they are placed on the sides, but this doesn't make too much of a difference, and some might say that it even makes the game a bit easier.\nOn the reels, there is an assortment of well-designed symbols that are all connected to the theme. There are apples, columns, a silver-sealed ring, a harp, a gladiator helmet, the winged horse Pegasus, and a Greek woman. Of course, there is also King Midas, who takes on the role of the game's wild, while the scatter is a rose that King Midas touches with his golden touch.\n\nSlot Machine features and symbols\nHowever, something that is unique in this casino slot is the option to gild the symbols. The player can choose to transform one of the symbols into the golden version of the same symbol. If a winning combination is hit, this symbol will pay 5 times more. You can choose to turn the lower-paying symbols into gold, which appear more often on the reels, or you can be patient and choose the higher-value ones and wait for the jackpots.\nWhen it comes to additional features, IGT has provided us with more than acceptable ones.\nThe King Midas symbol itself acts as a wild. Therefore, it can substitute for any other symbol except the golden rose.\nBonus. The golden rose is a symbol for the bonus round. To win free spins, you need three to five golden roses to appear on the reels. When they appear, you get 15, 50, or 100 free spins depending on how many golden roses you've obtained. Not only that, but the player is also encouraged to transform three, four, or five other symbols into gold during the free spins. What's more, more can be recovered.\nThe payout range is slightly below average. You will need to play around to win and be as cautious as possible. However, it still offers a decent payback rate.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you are passionate about the history of this famous ruler, then we can only suggest that you also play King Midas, the slot machine produced by Octavian Gaming, which allows you to win up to €300 on a single play. Try it now!\n\nFAQs - Goldify\nWhere can I play Goldify for free?\n\nGoldify and many other slot games await you on SlotJava!
