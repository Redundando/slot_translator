You can play first-class with minimum bets and set paylines, but it only pays out 0.40 lines per game, every time it's set.\n\nOnce you've placed a bet on Ghostbusters Spectral Search Slot, you will be asked to choose from six locations. Choose from Station, Library, Alley, Roof, Restaurant, or Hallway. To place your desired bet, move the arrow to the right or left on the Position field.\n\nAfter choosing a location on Ghostbusters Spectral Search Slot, the selected location will become the background. On the same display, you will find a paytable showing symbols and their values. Capture four White Ghosts, four Red Devils, three Purple Monsters, three Pink Men, three Red Ghosts, three Yellow Ghosts, or one Blue Ghost, and respectively earn 1500x, 250x, 100x, 30x, 30x, 15x, 5x, or 1x your stake.\n\nIf a green monster appears in any of the locations, you can win an instant payout of €1 of your stake. As soon as the location you've selected comes to the display, you'll notice a ghost detector displaying nine red panels. The goal is to correctly predict which of the nine panels hides the ghosts. Out of the nine panels, you'll have five chances to click.\n\nAll the discovered symbols will be added to the paytable. This will help you keep track of how many ghosts you have left to capture. Once the first round is finished, you'll be able to select another location where you get another five clicks. At the end of the game on Ghostbusters Spectral Search Slot, if any combination is completed, you win that sum.\n\nIf you enjoyed Ghostbusters Spectral Search, we recommend betting on Ghostbusters Slot, also produced by IGT. This game offers 30 paylines and incredible bonuses.\n        ",

To place your desired bet, move the arrow to the right or left on the Position field.\n\nAfter choosing a location on Ghostbusters Spectral Search Slot, the selected location will become the background. On the same display, you will find a paytable showing symbols and their values. Capture four White Ghosts, four Red Devils, three Purple Monsters, three Pink Men, three Red Ghosts, three Yellow Ghosts, or one Blue Ghost, and respectively earn 1500x, 250x, 100x, 30x, 30x, 15x, 5x, or 1x your stake.\n\nIf a green monster appears in any of the locations, you can win an instant payout of €1 of your stake. As soon as the location you've selected comes to the display, you'll notice a ghost detector displaying nine red panels. The goal is to correctly predict which of the nine panels hides the ghosts. Out of the nine panels, you'll have five chances to click.\n\nAll the discovered symbols will be added to the paytable. This will help you keep track of how many ghosts you have left to capture. Once the first round is finished, you'll be able to select another location where you get another five clicks. At the end of the game on Ghostbusters Spectral Search Slot, if any combination is completed, you win that sum.\n\nIf you enjoyed Ghostbusters Spectral Search, we recommend betting on Ghostbusters Slot, also produced by IGT. This game offers 30 paylines and incredible bonuses.\n            ",

This game is known for its high payout rate and falls within a reasonable range, giving players a fair chance to win big. The game has an RTP percentage (Return to Player) of 96% and an RTP of 96.4%, allowing for great gameplay practice. It's a new and ambiguous way to play, not too complicated. Once you've gotten the hang of it, you'll only want to keep playing. Betting amounts start at 1, much like basic slot games, but Ghostbusters Spectral Search is a progressive slot game that gets better with practice. If you're looking for variety, this game has got you covered.\n\nThe game boasts a spectral graphics design. In Ghostbusters Spectral Search, you will use the team's latest tool, the Spectral Processing Optical Operations Kit, to find hidden ghosts and win big. To start, buy a ticket and select a location where you think the ghosts might be lurking. Turn on your high-tech detection device and explore the room for ghosts. If you find at least two ghosts on your grid, you will win the prize detailed in the notepad on the left side of the game window! Relive the excitement of the Ghostbusters movies in Spectral Search and pocket some cash!\n\nAlthough the game is produced in 2D, it offers a more complex gameplay style than a normal 5-reel slot game, making the gameplay experience straightforward. Ghostbusters Spectral Search is one of the best slot games for fun available without download, but it's not that special. You can play first-class with minimum bets and set paylines, but it only pays out 0.40 lines per game, every time it's set.\n\nOnce you've placed a bet on Ghostbusters Spectral Search Slot, you will be asked to choose from six locations. Choose from Station, Library, Alley, Roof, Restaurant, or Hallway. To place your desired bet, move the arrow to the right or left on the Position field.\n\nAfter choosing a location on Ghostbusters Spectral Search Slot, the selected location will become the background. On the same display, you will find a paytable showing symbols and their values. Capture four White Ghosts, four Red Devils, three Purple Monsters, three Pink Men, three Red Ghosts, three Yellow Ghosts, or one Blue Ghost, and respectively earn 1500x, 250x, 100x, 30x, 30x, 15x, 5x, or 1x your stake.\n\nIf a green monster appears in any of the locations, you can win an instant payout of €1 of your stake. As soon as the location you've selected comes to the display, you'll notice a ghost detector displaying nine red panels. The goal is to correctly predict which of the nine panels hides the ghosts. Out of the nine panels, you'll have five chances to click.\n\nAll the discovered symbols will be added to the paytable. This will help you keep track of how many ghosts you have left to capture. Once the first round is finished, you'll be able to select another location where you get another five clicks. At the end of the game on Ghostbusters Spectral Search Slot, if any combination is completed, you win that sum.\n\nIf you enjoyed Ghostbusters Spectral Search, we recommend betting on Ghostbusters Slot, also produced by IGT. This game offers 30 paylines and incredible bonuses.\n            ",

This game is known for its high payout rate and falls within a reasonable range, giving players a fair chance to win big. The game has an RTP percentage (Return to Player) of 96% and an RTP of 96.4%, allowing for great gameplay practice. It's a new and ambiguous way to play, not too complicated. Once you've gotten the hang of it, you'll only want to keep playing. Betting amounts start at 1, much like basic slot games, but Ghostbusters Spectral Search is a progressive slot game that gets better with practice. If you're looking for variety, this game has got you covered.\n\nThe game boasts a spectral graphics design. In Ghostbusters Spectral Search, you will use the team's latest tool, the Spectral Processing Optical Operations Kit, to find hidden ghosts and win big. To start, buy a ticket and select a location where you think the ghosts might be lurking. Turn on your high-tech detection device and explore the room for ghosts. If you find at least two ghosts on your grid, you will win the prize detailed in the notepad on the left side of the game window! Relive the excitement of the Ghostbusters movies in Spectral Search and pocket some cash!\n\nAlthough the game is produced in 2D, it offers a more complex gameplay style than a normal 5-reel slot game, making the gameplay experience straightforward. Ghostbusters Spectral Search is one of the best slot games for fun available without download, but it's not that special. You can play first-class with minimum bets and set paylines, but it only pays out 0.40 lines per game, every time it's set.\n\nOnce you've placed a bet on Ghostbusters Spectral Search Slot, you will be asked to choose from six locations. Choose from Station, Library, Alley, Roof, Restaurant, or Hallway. To place your desired bet, move the arrow to the right or left on the Position field.\n\nAfter choosing a location on Ghostbusters Spectral Search Slot, the selected location will become the background. On the same display, you will find a paytable showing symbols and their values. Capture four White Ghosts, four Red Devils, three Purple Monsters, three Pink Men, three Red Ghosts, three Yellow Ghosts, or one Blue Ghost, and respectively earn 1500x, 250x, 100x, 30x, 30x, 15x, 5x, or 1x your stake.\n\nIf a green monster appears in any of the locations, you can win an instant payout of €1 of your stake. As soon as the location you've selected comes to the display, you'll notice a ghost detector displaying nine red panels. The goal is to correctly predict which of the nine panels hides the ghosts. Out of the nine panels, you'll have five chances to click.\n\nAll the discovered symbols will be added to the paytable. This will help you keep track of how many ghosts you have left to capture. Once the first round is finished, you'll be able to select another location where you get another five clicks. At the end of the game on Ghostbusters Spectral Search Slot, if any combination is completed, you win that sum.\n\nIf you enjoyed Ghostbusters Spectral Search, we recommend betting on Ghostbusters Slot, also produced by IGT. This game offers 30 paylines and incredible bonuses.\n            ",
