Parliamo di 40 Joker Staxx, una slot tradizionale che vuole ripresentare e in qualche modo anche rimodernare i temi e lo stile più retrò di questo settore di gioco. E’ stata lanciata nel 2018 e presenta una struttura con 5 rulli e 40 linee di pagamento, tagliando le meccaniche di gioco complesse e i bonus. Puntando da un minimo di 0.20 fino a 100€ per giro si possono attivare della combinazioni vincenti che vanno ad aumentare il loro valore grazie anche alla presenzia dello Scatter. Se punti al massimo della portata puoi arrivare a un montepremi pari a 20.000€. Vediamo di scoprire di più in merito a questa slot online che ha un RTP al 96,42% e una volatilità alta.\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nLa semplicità è la chiave con cui è stata costruita questa macchinetta. Come abbiamo detto Playson ha trovato un modo molto interessante per produrre un titolo capace di attirare tutti i giocatori che non amano grandi colpi di scena e spettacolarizzazioni di gioco. Abbiamo una griglia con simboli basic, che spaziano dalla Frutta classica ai Numeri, con l’amato e fortunato numero 7, oltre ai Lingotti d’oro e le Campane. Gioca con Ciliegie, Limoni e Arance, ma cerca di non staccare mai gli occhi di dosso dalle Prugne: se ne trovi 5 su una linea di pagamento puoi ottenere fino a 3 volte la tua puntata. Discorso analogo per la Campana che offre pagamenti fino a 6 volte la tua puntata, anche se il più redditizio è il numero 7. E’ presentato in versione Rossa e Oro: riuscire a trovarli ti restituirà 10 volte la scommessa effettuata.\nAnima vera di questo gameplay resta però il sensuale Jolly tutto al femminile, che può atterrare su tutti i rulli e sostituire ogni altra icona di gioco tranne lo Scatter. Può attivare un premio fino a un massimo di 40x la tua puntata. I più fortunati potranno trovarla su un rullo intero impilato, pronta a offrire interessanti combo. E visto che lo abbiamo già citato non dimentichiamo lo Scatter: è una Stella che va a colpirti con una ricompensa fino a 4, 20 o 200 volte la scommessa del player.\nNon troverai però nel gioco delle funzioni extra: sono infatti state eliminate tutte quelle animazioni e caratteristiche di gioco che sono tipicamente moderne. Ma anche senza bonus ha molto da dire questa macchinetta.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot 40 Joker staxx\nIl giocatore che vuole ricevere il massimo da questa slot, e magari mettere mano su una possibile Big Win, deve sperare di trovare il Jolly sui rulli. La slot piace perché è molto semplice e grazie alle sue 40 linee di pagamento può presentare un flusso costante di azione. Vincerai fino a 1.600 volte la scommessa per ogni giro. Insomma, se ami le slot fruttate con uno stile retrò sei nel posto giusto: inizia la tua avventura, imposta la tua scommessa e lasciati guidare in questa avventura che può essere ricca e divertente.\n",

The game is devoid of any complex gameplay mechanics or bonuses, making it the perfect choice for players who do not like flashy gameplay. The slot game features a minimum bet of 0.20€ and a maximum of 100€ per spin, offering players a chance to activate winning combinations that increase in value through the Scatter symbol. The game has an RTP of 96.42% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe game's graphics and symbols are simple and traditional, removing all modern animations and gameplay characteristics. The symbols range from classic fruit to numbers, with the lucky number 7, gold ingots, and bells also featuring on the grid. Finding five plums or bells on a payline can earn up to 3 or 6 times your bet, respectively, while finding five lucky 7s can earn up to 10 times your bet. The Jolly, which is all feminine, is the centerpiece of this gameplay and can activate a prize of up to a maximum of 40x your bet.\n\nPayouts\n\nThe payouts for 40 Joker Staxx: 40 Lines are based on the combinations of game symbols on the reels. The game has the potential to reward players up to 1,600 times their bet per spin for finding 5 of the highest valued symbols on a payline. The Scatter symbol can reward players with an amount up to 4, 20, or 200 times their bet. Players must keep their eyes peeled for the Jolly symbol, as it can replace any other game icon except for the Scatter and activate a prize of up to a maximum of 40x your bet.\n\nRTP\n\n40 Joker Staxx: 40 Lines features an RTP of 96.42%, which is in line with industry standards. This means that the game has good odds of paying out to players in the long run. However, players should bear in mind that the game has high volatility, so payouts can be infrequent but more substantial when they do hit.\n\nVolatility\n\nThe game has high volatility, meaning that it offers infrequent payouts, but when they do hit, they tend to be more substantial. This may not be ideal for players who prefer a more consistent level of payouts, but it does offer excitement and the potential for big wins, which will appeal to high-risk players.\n\n        \n            ",

This traditional slot game seeks to reintroduce and revamp the retro themes and styles of the gaming industry. Launched in 2018, it boasts a structure with 5 reels and 40 paylines, cutting down on complex gameplay mechanics and bonuses. With a minimum bet of 0.20€ and a maximum of 100€ per spin, players can activate winning combinations that increase in value, thanks to the presence of the Scatter. Betting at the maximum level can result in a whopping jackpot of 20,000€. Let's delve into this online slot game with an RTP of 96.42% and high volatility.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nSimplicity is the key to the construction of this slot machine. As previously stated, Playson has come up with a very interesting way to produce a title capable of attracting players who dislike big twists and flashy gameplays. We have a grid with basic symbols, ranging from classic fruit to numbers—with the beloved and lucky number 7—along with gold ingots and bells. Play with cherries, lemons, and oranges, but never take your eyes off the plums: if you find 5 on a payline, you can earn up to 3 times your bet. The same goes for the Bell, which offers payouts up to 6 times your bet, but the most profitable is the number 7. It's presented in red and gold: finding them will get you 10 times your bet back.\n\nThe real heart of this gameplay, however, is the sensual Jolly, all feminine, which can land on all reels and replace any other game icon except for the Scatter. It can activate a prize of up to a maximum of 40x your bet. The luckiest will find it stacked on an entire reel, ready to offer interesting combos. And since we've already mentioned it, let's not forget the Scatter: it's a star that rewards the player with an amount up to 4, 20, or 200 times their bet.\n\nHowever, there are no extra features in the game; all those modern animations and game characteristics have been removed. Nonetheless, this slot machine has a lot to say, even without bonuses.\n\nFinal Thoughts on \"40 Joker Staxx: 40 Lines\"\nThe player who wants to get the maximum from this slot, and perhaps seize a possible Big Win, must hope to find the Jolly on the reels. This slot game is popular because it is very simple and, thanks to its 40 paylines, can provide a constant flow of action. You can win up to 1,600 times your bet per spin. In short, if you love fruity slots with a retro style, you're in the right place. Begin your adventure, set your bet, and let yourself be guided through this potentially lucrative and entertaining journey.\n            ",

This traditional slot game seeks to reintroduce and revamp the retro themes and styles of the gaming industry. Launched in 2018, it boasts a structure with 5 reels and 40 paylines, cutting down on complex gameplay mechanics and bonuses. With a minimum bet of 0.20€ and a maximum of 100€ per spin, players can activate winning combinations that increase in value, thanks to the presence of the Scatter. Betting at the maximum level can result in a whopping jackpot of 20,000€. Let's delve into this online slot game with an RTP of 96.42% and high volatility.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nSimplicity is the key to the construction of this slot machine. As previously stated, Playson has come up with a very interesting way to produce a title capable of attracting players who dislike big twists and flashy gameplays. We have a grid with basic symbols, ranging from classic fruit to numbers—with the beloved and lucky number 7—along with gold ingots and bells. Play with cherries, lemons, and oranges, but never take your eyes off the plums: if you find 5 on a payline, you can earn up to 3 times your bet. The same goes for the Bell, which offers payouts up to 6 times your bet, but the most profitable is the number 7. It's presented in red and gold: finding them will get you 10 times your bet back.\n\nThe real heart of this gameplay, however, is the sensual Jolly, all feminine, which can land on all reels and replace any other game icon except for the Scatter. It can activate a prize of up to a maximum of 40x your bet. The luckiest will find it stacked on an entire reel, ready to offer interesting combos. And since we've already mentioned it, let's not forget the Scatter: it's a star that rewards the player with an amount up to 4, 20, or 200 times their bet.\n\nHowever, there are no extra features in the game; all those modern animations and game characteristics have been removed. Nonetheless, this slot machine has a lot to say, even without bonuses.\n\nFinal Thoughts on \"40 Joker Staxx: 40 Lines\"\nThe player who wants to get the maximum from this slot, and perhaps seize a possible Big Win, must hope to find the Jolly on the reels. This slot game is popular because it is very simple and, thanks to its 40 paylines, can provide a constant flow of action. You can win up to 1,600 times your bet per spin. In short, if you love fruity slots with a retro style, you're in the right place. Begin your adventure, set your bet, and let yourself be guided through this potentially lucrative and entertaining journey.\n            ",
