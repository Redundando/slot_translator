It awards a win when you get a matching symbol on at least 3 (sometimes 2) consecutive reels from left to right. The versatile gameplay of the slot features fixed jackpots, Power Reels, Wild multipliers, and free spins.\n\nSymbol Design and Theme\n\nDiamond King Gold offers a Savanna-themed world of the African wilderness, which includes wild animals, including lions, zebras, rhinos, and meerkats. The background has an extended view of the savanna that immerses players into the gameplay. There are 13 symbols in total, of which 11 are regular payout elements. The most profitable symbols are the Gem representing the Wild and the Savannah icon that acts as a bonus symbol.\n\nWild Multipliers and Power Reels\n\nPower Range is a 3x2 rectangular frame located in the center of the slot. Every Wild symbol that lands within the frame turns into a 2x Wild multiplier. During any random spin in the base game, the Power Range box can expand to fill reels 2, 3, and 4 via the Roar feature, where any Wild landing in the Power Range during the Roar feature will receive a 2x, 3x, or 5x multiplier.\n\nDiamond Jackpot Feature\n\nThe Diamond Meter is available on the board, and every time a Wild symbol lands within the Power Range, it will be collected and stored in the Diamond Meter at the top of the reels. Once the Diamond Meter is full, the Diamond Jackpot function is triggered. During the jackpot game, you will need to collect the same type of 3 gems as possible, and a fixed jackpot will be awarded with the following values: Green Diamond (mini jackpot) - Win 20x your bet; Purple Diamond (minor jackpot) - Win 50x your bet; Red Diamond (major jackpot) - Win 200x your bet; Golden Diamond (grand jackpot) - Win 5,000x your bet.\n\nFixed Jackpots\n\nDiamond King Gold has four fixed jackpot levels, which are awarded during the Diamond Jackpot game. The jackpots include Mini, Minor, Major, and Grand. Any player who is lucky enough to hit the Grand jackpot can potentially win up to 5,000x their original bet.\n\nFree Spins\n\nIf a player catches 3 or more Bonus symbols on the reels, they activate the free spin feature of the Diamond King Gold slot game. Depending on how many Bonus symbols trigger this feature, the player will get 10, 15, or 20 free spins. During the free games, the Roar feature is always active, and players can power up high-paying elements by collecting Golden Lion symbols. They can also win extra free spins by getting Bonus symbols during the feature.\n\nMobile Accessibility\n\nThe Diamond King Gold online slot game is based on HTML5 technology and is accessible to play on all modern Android and iOS mobile devices.\n\nDemo Version Availability\n\nPlayers can play Diamond King Gold for free in demo mode at an online casino that offers the game. This option allows players to gain experience, test strategies, and get familiar with all aspects of the game before risking real money.\n\n        \n            ",
