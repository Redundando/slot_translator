            "response": "Cubes 2: A Review for Experienced Gamblers\n\nAfter the overwhelming success of its predecessor, the renowned Hacksaw Gaming proudly presents Cubes 2, featuring the world's most famous cube. Surely, there is no need to introduce this game, which has captivated millions of people worldwide since the mid-70s. With each side of the Rubik's Cube having a different color subdivided into quadrants, this game challenges players to return each face to its original color. \n\nDespite minor changes to the graphics, this update enhances gameplay features immensely. Instead of cubes, the background now showcases parallelepipeds, while the cube itself portrays the three-dimensional aspect of the quadrants. Beneath the screen lies the Bonus button to purchase special features, a menu access button, the balance, bet selector, Start, and Autoplay. Players will enjoy the relaxing karma-style music, accompanied by sound effects during spins and each win.\n\nCubes 2 Features\n\nSimilar to its predecessor, Cubes 2 belongs to the Pocketz series by Hacksaw Gaming. The slot game commences at a 5x5 grid, which expands twice its size to 11x11 based on winnings and returns to its original size once there are no more winning combinations. To win, players must match adjacent symbols of the same color anywhere on the grid. With a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €100, Cubes 2 suits every budget. Players can activate automatic spins through the screen or the menu, with the option of setting win or loss limits. The slot game is highly volatile, but its theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.3%.\n\nSymbols and Special Features\n\nPlayers need to match at least five quadrants of the same color, up to a maximum of 25 or more, to win. In contrast to the first version, Cubes 2 has six colors - purple, pink, green, red, blue, and yellow - all with equal value. \n\nThe slot game's highlight is its unique special features. The corner quadrants of the initial 5x5 grid display X's. If a winning combination includes a corner quadrant, then a multiplier equal to the number of cubes in the combination appears. If the winning combination encompasses multiple corners, the amounts will be added. For instance, if the combination has nine symbols and affects two corners, the multiplier will be 18.\n\nFive or more winning combinations of different colors will activate five free spins up to a maximum of 12. Initially, four mysterious cubes appear, from which players must select three: two reveal the colors fixed on the grid after each free spin, while the third shows the assigned multiplier. The grid size does not decrease during the bonus game, and the maximum win is 10,500 times the bet.\n\nIf players get a winning combination that covers all four corners during the regular game, they will receive more free spins. All collected colors remain fixed during the bonus game. These two features are also available for purchase through a dedicated button.\n\nFAQs\n\nCan players win real money by playing Cubes 2?\n\nYes, players can win real money by playing Cubes 2 after going through the registration process on the casino's hosting website, for instance, Pokerstars, and making a deposit. Those who bet with real money may even receive a significant no-deposit bonus.\n\nHow can players beat the slot game, Cubes 2?\n\nEvery online slot game operates on a random number generator, but players can increase their chances by wisely using their bets and sticking rigidly to their predetermined budget. Trusting one's luck always helps.",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Cubes 2\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nCubes 2:\nFollowing the success of the first chapter, Hacksaw Gaming has decided to dive into the creation of Cubes 2, where the absolute protagonist is, once again, the most famous cube in the world. Impossible not to know this game that has thrilled millions of people around the planet since the mid-70s. Each face of the Rubik's cube has a different color and is divided into quadrants. By rotating them, the colors are mixed. Our aim is to restore the initial state, that is, each face with a different color.\n\nCompared to the previous version, this update changes little regarding the graphics, but adds much in terms of features. Instead of cubes in the background, we find rectangular prisms, and the game's cube immediately reveals the threedimensional nature of the quadrants rather than appearing as a flat figure.\n\nA calm karma-style music accompanies the game, interspersed with some sound effects during the spin and in case of a win.\n\nCubes 2 Features:\nCubes 2, like the first version, is part of those Pocketz games, a special series from Hacksaw Gaming in a pocketable version.\n\nThe slot starts with a 5x5 grid that can increase by 2x based on the wins until it becomes an 11x11. It returns to normal size when there are no more winning combinations. You win by matching a series of identical symbols adjacent anywhere in the grid.\n\nWith a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €100, Cubes 2 is suitable for every wallet. The automatic spins can be activated from the side of the screen or from within the menu, and it is possible to set some win or loss limits.\n\nThe volatility is high, while for RTP for Cubes 2, we are at 96.3%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\nTo win, you need to combine at least 5 quadrants of the same color up to a maximum of 25 or more. Unlike the first version, in Cubes 2, the violet, pink, green, red, light blue, and yellow symbols all have the same value.\n\nNow, let's talk about special features, the real flagship of the slot.\nIn the corner squares of the initial 5x5 grid, there are xes. If you get a winning combination that includes the corner quadrant, a multiplier equal to the number of cubes making up the combination will be shown. If the winning combination involves more corners, the amounts will be added up. For example, if we have a combination of 9 symbols involving two corners, then the multiplier will be 18.\n\nWith 5 or more winning combinations of different colors, you get 5 free spins up to a maximum of 12. Initially, 4 mystery cubes will be displayed, and we will be asked to select 3: two reveal the colors that will be locked on the grid after each free spin, and one will show the assigned multiplier. The size of the grid does not decrease during the bonus game, and the maximum win is 10,500 times the bet.\n\nIf during the normal game, you get a combination that involves all four corners, you will have Free Spins. In the bonus game, all the colors collected will remain fixed until the end.\nThese two functions can also be purchased through the appropriate button.\n\nFAQs:\nCan you win real money playing Cubes 2?\n\nYes, but first, you must have completed the registration process on the website of the casino that hosts this title, such as Pokerstars, made a deposit, and if you bet with real money, you could also receive an excellent no deposit bonus.\n\nHow can I beat Cubes 2 slot?\n\nEvery online slot is based on the random number generator, so you can beat it through wise betting, strictly adhering to your self-defined budget limits for the game, and trusting your luck.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay mechanics and unique features\nRewards and bonuses\nBetting range and accessibility\nVolatility and RTP\nOverall gaming experience\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Cubes 2:\nFollowing the success of the first chapter, Hacksaw Gaming has decided to dive into the creation of Cubes 2, where the absolute protagonist is, once again, the most famous cube in the world. Impossible not to know this game that has thrilled millions of people around the planet since the mid-70s. Each face of the Rubik's cube has a different color and is divided into quadrants. By rotating them, the colors are mixed. Our aim is to restore the initial state, that is, each face with a different color.\n\nCompared to the previous version, this update changes little regarding the graphics, but adds much in terms of features. Instead of cubes in the background, we find rectangular prisms, and the game's cube immediately reveals the threedimensional nature of the quadrants rather than appearing as a flat figure.\n\nA calm karma-style music accompanies the game, interspersed with some sound effects during the spin and in case of a win.\n\nCubes 2 Features:\nCubes 2, like the first version, is part of those Pocketz games, a special series from Hacksaw Gaming in a pocketable version.\n\nThe slot starts with a 5x5 grid that can increase by 2x based on the wins until it becomes an 11x11. It returns to normal size when there are no more winning combinations. You win by matching a series of identical symbols adjacent anywhere in the grid.\n\nWith a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €100, Cubes 2 is suitable for every wallet. The automatic spins can be activated from the side of the screen or from within the menu, and it is possible to set some win or loss limits.\n\nThe volatility is high, while for RTP for Cubes 2, we are at 96.3%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\nTo win, you need to combine at least 5 quadrants of the same color up to a maximum of 25 or more. Unlike the first version, in Cubes 2, the violet, pink, green, red, light blue, and yellow symbols all have the same value.\n\nNow, let's talk about special features, the real flagship of the slot.\nIn the corner squares of the initial 5x5 grid, there are xes. If you get a winning combination that includes the corner quadrant, a multiplier equal to the number of cubes making up the combination will be shown. If the winning combination involves more corners, the amounts will be added up. For example, if we have a combination of 9 symbols involving two corners, then the multiplier will be 18.\n\nWith 5 or more winning combinations of different colors, you get 5 free spins up to a maximum of 12. Initially, 4 mystery cubes will be displayed, and we will be asked to select 3: two reveal the colors that will be locked on the grid after each free spin, and one will show the assigned multiplier. The size of the grid does not decrease during the bonus game, and the maximum win is 10,500 times the bet.\n\nIf during the normal game, you get a combination that involves all four corners, you will have Free Spins. In the bonus game, all the colors collected will remain fixed until the end.\nThese two functions can also be purchased through the appropriate button.\n\nFAQs:\nCan you win real money playing Cubes 2?\n\nYes, but first, you must have completed the registration process on the website of the casino that hosts this title, such as Pokerstars, made a deposit, and if you bet with real money, you could also receive an excellent no deposit bonus.\n\nHow can I beat Cubes 2 slot?\n\nEvery online slot is based on the random number generator, so you can beat it through wise betting, strictly adhering to your self-defined budget limits for the game, and trusting your luck.\n            ",

The game features a 5x5 grid that can increase by 2x based on the wins until it becomes an 11x11. You win by matching a series of identical symbols adjacent anywhere in the grid. Cubes 2 is part of those Pocketz games, a special series from Hacksaw Gaming in a pocketable version. One of the main features of the game is the xes in the corner squares of the initial 5x5 grid. If you get a winning combination that includes the corner quadrant, a multiplier equal to the number of cubes making up the combination will be shown. If the winning combination involves more corners, the amounts will be added up. Additionally, with 5 or more winning combinations of different colors, players can get 5 free spins up to a maximum of 12.\n\nRewards and bonuses\n\nIn Cubes 2, you need to combine at least 5 quadrants of the same color up to a maximum of 25 or more to win. Unlike the first version, in Cubes 2, the violet, pink, green, red, light blue, and yellow symbols all have the same value. One of the bonuses available is the Free Spins. If you get a combination during the normal game that involves all four corners, you will have Free Spins. In the bonus game, all the colors collected will remain fixed until the end. Additionally, players can purchase the bonus game and multiplier features through the appropriate button. The maximum win in Cubes 2 is 10,500 times the bet.\n\nBetting range and accessibility\n\nCubes 2 is suitable for every wallet, with a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €100. The automatic spins can be activated from the side of the screen or from within the menu, and it is possible to set some win or loss limits. To play Cubes 2, players must complete the registration process on the website of the casino that hosts this title and make a deposit.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nCubes 2 has high volatility and an RTP of 96.3%. Volatility refers to the amount of risk involved in playing a particular game. A highly volatile game like Cubes 2 means that there is a high risk-reward ratio. Players can expect a big win, but they might have to wait longer for it. The RTP or Return to Player percentage refers to the amount of money that a particular slot machine pays back to players over time. In the case of Cubes 2, it pays back 96.3% of the money wagered.\n\nOverall gaming experience\n\nCubes 2 by Hacksaw Gaming might not be a visually stunning game, but it has a unique and interesting gameplay mechanic that offers a fun and challenging experience. The game's high volatility and RTP make it an excellent choice for players looking for a big win. The calm background music adds to the overall gaming experience. The availability of purchaseable bonuses and multiplier features further adds to the overall entertainment value.

Impossible not to know this game that has thrilled millions of people around the planet since the mid-70s. Each face of the Rubik's cube has a different color and is divided into quadrants. By rotating them, the colors are mixed. Our aim is to restore the initial state, that is, each face with a different color.\n\nCompared to the previous version, this update changes little regarding the graphics, but adds much in terms of features. Instead of cubes in the background, we find rectangular prisms, and the game's cube immediately reveals the threedimensional nature of the quadrants rather than appearing as a flat figure.\n\nA calm karma-style music accompanies the game, interspersed with some sound effects during the spin and in case of a win.\n\nCubes 2 Features:\nCubes 2, like the first version, is part of those Pocketz games, a special series from Hacksaw Gaming in a pocketable version.\n\nThe slot starts with a 5x5 grid that can increase by 2x based on the wins until it becomes an 11x11. It returns to normal size when there are no more winning combinations. You win by matching a series of identical symbols adjacent anywhere in the grid.\n\nWith a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €100, Cubes 2 is suitable for every wallet. The automatic spins can be activated from the side of the screen or from within the menu, and it is possible to set some win or loss limits.\n\nThe volatility is high, while for RTP for Cubes 2, we are at 96.3%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\nTo win, you need to combine at least 5 quadrants of the same color up to a maximum of 25 or more. Unlike the first version, in Cubes 2, the violet, pink, green, red, light blue, and yellow symbols all have the same value.\n\nNow, let's talk about special features, the real flagship of the slot.\nIn the corner squares of the initial 5x5 grid, there are xes. If you get a winning combination that includes the corner quadrant, a multiplier equal to the number of cubes making up the combination will be shown. If the winning combination involves more corners, the amounts will be added up. For example, if we have a combination of 9 symbols involving two corners, then the multiplier will be 18.\n\nWith 5 or more winning combinations of different colors, you get 5 free spins up to a maximum of 12. Initially, 4 mystery cubes will be displayed, and we will be asked to select 3: two reveal the colors that will be locked on the grid after each free spin, and one will show the assigned multiplier. The size of the grid does not decrease during the bonus game, and the maximum win is 10,500 times the bet.\n\nIf during the normal game, you get a combination that involves all four corners, you will have Free Spins. In the bonus game, all the colors collected will remain fixed until the end.\nThese two functions can also be purchased through the appropriate button.\n\nFAQs:\nCan you win real money playing Cubes 2?\n\nYes, but first, you must have completed the registration process on the website of the casino that hosts this title, such as Pokerstars, made a deposit, and if you bet with real money, you could also receive an excellent no deposit bonus.\n\nHow can I beat Cubes 2 slot?\n\nEvery online slot is based on the random number generator, so you can beat it through wise betting, strictly adhering to your self-defined budget limits for the game, and trusting your luck.\n            ",
