Playable on all devices from just 10 cents per spin, this steampunk-themed slot has a Mystery Symbols feature that can transform into any symbol including the wild. There's an optional Win Booster where you play 50% more per spin, but low-value symbols are removed from the Mystery Symbols feature. The main attraction is the Free Spins feature where you can get up to 3 Mystery Reels that can bring up to 3 wild reels on each free spin.\n\nStep into a retro sci-fi world and discover what our review of the Fortunium online slot has to say about this feature-rich, exciting slot machine. Victorian-style people appear against the backdrop of a futuristic city. Named Maximillian and Victoria, these characters are just a few of the steampunk-style images you'll see in this five-reel, 40-line Microgaming slot.\n\nElaborate weapons, airships, and a treasure chest all showcase this distinctive game. It has some exceptional bonuses to complement its good looks, with wild substitutions, symbol transformations, and free spins with richer reels for fun. An optional Win Booster feature adds high-value symbols to the mix and extra money to your bankroll.\n\nPurely Steampunk Graphics\nFortunium is a Microgaming 5-reel, 5-row, 40-payline slot that can be played on all devices from 10 cents to €125 per spin. With a steampunk theme, it comes with stacks of Mystery Symbols, which can transform into another symbol as well as a Win Booster feature where you can add a bet to remove low-value symbols that appear in the Mystery Symbols feature. There is also a Free Spins feature where you can get up to 5 Mystery Reels on each free spin.\n\nFortunium takes you to the golden city of opportunities and has a steampunk theme set in a world of mechanical masterpieces and alchemical artwork. This game is much more enjoyable in portrait mode on mobile/smartphones, but can also be played on desktops and tablets.\n\nThe city behind the reels resembles something from The Fifth Element or some of the Star Wars movies, where the vast Coruscant towers have risen miles into the sky. It's an impressive sight, but let's focus on the reels with an elaborate frame because that's where all the action takes place in the Fortunium online slot. Each of the five reels has five symbols, and prizes are won by matching any type of symbol on a payline from left to right.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nWhen it comes to symbols, you have clubs, hearts, diamonds, and spades, as well as plasma guns, airships, treasure chests, and two characters: Maximillian and Victoria. Both of these symbols are stacked in a height of 5, while all other symbols appear in a double stack. There's also a wild character that substitutes for all symbols except the scatter.\n\nIn terms of bonuses, there's a Mystery Symbols feature that plays when Mystery Symbols land on the reels - they open up to reveal a low, high, or wild symbol chosen at random.\n\nMore importantly, Fortunium comes with a Win Booster feature that you decide when to use - it will cost you 50% more for every spin (i.e. from 10 cents to 15 cents per spin on minimum bets), but eliminates the chance for Mystery Symbols to reveal low-value symbols. This means that the Mystery Symbols feature will only reveal high-value symbols or wild symbols.\n\nFortunium also comes with a Free Spins feature that plays when you get 3, 4, or 5 scatters anywhere on the reels - you will then receive 10 free spins. Each additional scatter you get during the feature will give you an extra free spin.\n\nNow, 3, 4, or 5 scatters will give you 1, 2, or 3 Mystery Reels on each free spin respectively - the Mystery Reels contain only Mystery Symbols, which means you could end up with 3 Full Wild Reels on each free spin! As a result, this will improve your chances of winning up to 800 times your bet on each spin.\n\nFortunium is a medium-variance slot with balanced wins - the Win Booster feature can be helpful as it reveals high-value or wild symbols only during the Mystery Symbols feature, but it's really the Free Spins feature that counts.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the steampunk theme, we recommend NetEnt's Steam Tower and Yggdrasil Gaming's Cazino Zeppelin slot machines. Cazino Zeppelin, produced by Yggdrasil Gaming, has an unusual theme as it is set on a 1930s airship. This high-variance game also features a Free Spins feature, where you can start with a maximum of 20 free spins with wilds that you get when you activate the feature that become Sticky during the feature. In addition, each new wilds will also become a Sticky wilds that will remain throughout the feature, with the hope of getting dizzying wins.",

Cazino Zeppelin è prodotto da Yggdrasil Gaming e ha un tema insolito come il suo set su un dirigibile degli anni Trenta. Questo gioco ad alta varianza riguarda anche la funzione Free Spins, in cui si può iniziare con un massimo di 20 giri gratis con i wild che si hanno quando si attiva la funzione che diventa Sticky nella funzione. Inoltre, ogni nuova wilds diventerà anche una wilds Sticky che rimarrà in tutta la funzione, con la speranza di ottenere vittorie da capogiro.\n\n        ",

This portrait-focused game has a steampunk theme and features a Mystery Symbols feature that can turn into any symbol, including the wild. There is an optional Win Booster feature where you play 50% more per spin, but remove low-value symbols from the Mystery Symbols feature. The main attraction is the Free Spins feature where you can get up to 3 Mystery Reels that can bring up to 3 wild reels on every free spin.\nTransport yourself to a retro-style sci-fi world and discover what our review of the exciting Fortunium online slot machine has to offer. Victorian-style characters named Maximillian and Victoria are just a couple of the steampunk-themed images you'll see on this Microgaming five-reel, 40-line slot machine.\nComplex weapons, airships, and an elaborately designed treasure chest are symbols that add to this distinctive game's aesthetic appeal. It has some outstanding bonuses that complement its great looks, with wild substitutions, symbol transformations, and free spins with richer reels for your enjoyment. An optional Win Booster feature adds high-value symbols to the mix and extra money to your bankroll.\nPurely steampunk graphics\nFortunium is a 5-reel, 5-row, 40-payline slot from Microgaming that can be played from 10 cents to €125 per spin on all devices. With a steampunk theme, it comes with stacks of mystery symbols that can turn into another symbol as well as a Win Booster feature where you can add a bet to remove low-value symbols that appear in the Mystery Symbols feature. There is also a Free Spins feature where you can get up to 5 Mystery Reels on each free spin.\nFortunium takes you to the golden city of opportunities and has a steampunk theme, set in a world of mechanical masterpieces and alchemical artwork. This game is much more enjoyable in portrait mode on mobile/smartphones but can also be played on desktop and tablet.\nThe city behind the reels looks like something out of The Fifth Element or some of the Star Wars movies, where the vast Coruscant towers have risen miles into the sky. It's an impressive sight, but let's focus on the reels with an elaborate border because that's where all the action takes place in the Fortunium online slot. Each of the five reels has five symbols, and prizes are won by matching any type of symbol on a payline from left to right.\nSlot machine functions and symbols\nWhen it comes to symbols, you have clubs, hearts, diamonds, and spades, as well as plasma guns, airships, treasure chests, and 2 characters: Maximillian and Victoria. Both of these symbols are stacked vertically five high, while all other symbols appear in double stack. There is also a wild character that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\nIn terms of bonuses, there is a Mystery Symbols feature that is played when the Mystery Symbols land on the reels – they open up to reveal a randomly chosen low, high, or wild symbol.\nEven more importantly, Fortunium comes with a Win Booster feature that you decide when to use – it will cost you 50% more per spin (i.e., from 10 cents to 15 cents per spin on minimum bets) but removes the chance for the Mystery Symbol to reveal low-value symbols. This means that the Mystery Symbols feature will only reveal high-value symbols or wild symbols.\nFortunium also comes with a Free Spins feature that is played when you get 3, 4, or 5 scatters anywhere on the reels – you will then receive 10 free spins. Each additional scatter you get during the feature will give you an extra free spin.\nNow, 3, 4, or 5 scatters will give you 1, 2, or 3 Mystery Reels on each free spin, respectively – the Mystery Reels contain only the Mystery Symbols, meaning you could end up with 3 Full Wild Reels on every free spin! As a result, this will improve your chances of winning up to 800 times your stake on each spin.\nFortunium is a medium variance slot with balanced wins – the Win Booster feature can be useful as it reveals high-value or wild symbols only during the Mystery Symbols feature, but it's actually the Free Spins feature that matters.\nOther similar slot machines\nIf you like the steampunk theme, we recommend NetEnt's Steam Tower and Yggdrasil Gaming's Cazino Zeppelin slot machines. Cazino Zeppelin, produced by Yggdrasil Gaming, has an unusual theme as it is set on a 1930s airship. This high-variance game is also about the Free Spins feature, where you can start with a maximum of 20 free spins with the wilds that you have when you activate the feature becoming sticky throughout the feature. Additionally, each new wild will also become a sticky wild that will remain throughout the feature, hoping to i\u0002ncrease your chances of getting dizzying wins."

This portrait-focused game has a steampunk theme and features a Mystery Symbols feature that can turn into any symbol, including the wild. There is an optional Win Booster feature where you play 50% more per spin, but remove low-value symbols from the Mystery Symbols feature. The main attraction is the Free Spins feature where you can get up to 3 Mystery Reels that can bring up to 3 wild reels on every free spin.\nTransport yourself to a retro-style sci-fi world and discover what our review of the exciting Fortunium online slot machine has to offer. Victorian-style characters named Maximillian and Victoria are just a couple of the steampunk-themed images you'll see on this Microgaming five-reel, 40-line slot machine.\nComplex weapons, airships, and an elaborately designed treasure chest are symbols that add to this distinctive game's aesthetic appeal. It has some outstanding bonuses that complement its great looks, with wild substitutions, symbol transformations, and free spins with richer reels for your enjoyment. An optional Win Booster feature adds high-value symbols to the mix and extra money to your bankroll.\nPurely steampunk graphics\nFortunium is a 5-reel, 5-row, 40-payline slot from Microgaming that can be played from 10 cents to €125 per spin on all devices. With a steampunk theme, it comes with stacks of mystery symbols that can turn into another symbol as well as a Win Booster feature where you can add a bet to remove low-value symbols that appear in the Mystery Symbols feature. There is also a Free Spins feature where you can get up to 5 Mystery Reels on each free spin.\nFortunium takes you to the golden city of opportunities and has a steampunk theme, set in a world of mechanical masterpieces and alchemical artwork. This game is much more enjoyable in portrait mode on mobile/smartphones but can also be played on desktop and tablet.\nThe city behind the reels looks like something out of The Fifth Element or some of the Star Wars movies, where the vast Coruscant towers have risen miles into the sky. It's an impressive sight, but let's focus on the reels with an elaborate border because that's where all the action takes place in the Fortunium online slot. Each of the five reels has five symbols, and prizes are won by matching any type of symbol on a payline from left to right.\nSlot machine functions and symbols\nWhen it comes to symbols, you have clubs, hearts, diamonds, and spades, as well as plasma guns, airships, treasure chests, and 2 characters: Maximillian and Victoria. Both of these symbols are stacked vertically five high, while all other symbols appear in double stack. There is also a wild character that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\nIn terms of bonuses, there is a Mystery Symbols feature that is played when the Mystery Symbols land on the reels – they open up to reveal a randomly chosen low, high, or wild symbol.\nEven more importantly, Fortunium comes with a Win Booster feature that you decide when to use – it will cost you 50% more per spin (i.e., from 10 cents to 15 cents per spin on minimum bets) but removes the chance for the Mystery Symbol to reveal low-value symbols. This means that the Mystery Symbols feature will only reveal high-value symbols or wild symbols.\nFortunium also comes with a Free Spins feature that is played when you get 3, 4, or 5 scatters anywhere on the reels – you will then receive 10 free spins. Each additional scatter you get during the feature will give you an extra free spin.\nNow, 3, 4, or 5 scatters will give you 1, 2, or 3 Mystery Reels on each free spin, respectively – the Mystery Reels contain only the Mystery Symbols, meaning you could end up with 3 Full Wild Reels on every free spin! As a result, this will improve your chances of winning up to 800 times your stake on each spin.\nFortunium is a medium variance slot with balanced wins – the Win Booster feature can be useful as it reveals high-value or wild symbols only during the Mystery Symbols feature, but it's actually the Free Spins feature that matters.\nOther similar slot machines\nIf you like the steampunk theme, we recommend NetEnt's Steam Tower and Yggdrasil Gaming's Cazino Zeppelin slot machines. Cazino Zeppelin, produced by Yggdrasil Gaming, has an unusual theme as it is set on a 1930s airship. This high-variance game is also about the Free Spins feature, where you can start with a maximum of 20 free spins with the wilds that you have when you activate the feature becoming sticky throughout the feature. Additionally, each new wild will also become a sticky wild that will remain throughout the feature, hoping to i\u0002ncrease your chances of getting dizzying wins.\n            ",

Then you can activate the Win Booster feature with just one click. Although you'll have to pay 50% more per spin, it removes the chance for the Mystery Symbol to reveal low-value symbols. Why not give it a try and see how the feature boosts your earnings?</p>\n\n    <p>Moreover, you mustn't miss the Free Spins feature. To activate this round, you'll need to match three or more scatters anywhere on the board. You'll receive ten free spins, and every extra scatter gives you an extra free spin. That's not all! During the Free Spins feature, you can receive 1, 2, or 3 Mystery Reels that contain only the Mystery Symbols. This can lead to up to three complete wild reels on every free spin, giving you a chance to win up to 800 times your stake!</p>\n\n    <p>If you're a risk-taker who is willing to try their luck, you'll love this game. The special features in Fortunium make it stand out from the crowd. Besides, It's always exciting to explore the hidden features of any game and win big. So, why not give it a go and let us know how many of those wild reels you trigger?</p>\"\n}"

The game has a steampunk theme and features symbols such as plasma guns, airships, treasure chests, and two characters named Maximillian and Victoria. The game can be played on all devices with betting ranges between 10 cents to €125 per spin.\n\nTheme and Graphics\n\nFortunium is set in a world of mechanical masterpieces and alchemical artwork with a steampunk theme. The game has a complex weapons design, outstanding graphics, and some stylish symbols that add to the game's aesthetic appeal. The city behind the reels looks impressive like something from a sci-fi movie, and the elaborate border around the reels is where all the action takes place. The game is enjoyable in portrait mode on smartphones and mobile devices but can also be played on desktop and tablet.\n\nPaylines and Reels\n\nFortunium is played on a set of reels arranged in a 5x5 grid with 40 paylines. Each of the five reels has five symbols, and prizes are won by matching any type of symbol on a payline from left to right. Symbols include clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades, plasma guns, airships, treasure chests, and characters named Maximillian and Victoria. The wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the scatter symbol.\n\nBonus Features\n\nFortunium online slot game has three main bonus features, including the Mystery Symbols Feature, Win Booster Feature, and Free Spins Feature. The Mystery Symbols feature activates when the Mystery Symbols land on the reels and can turn into any symbol, including the wild. The Win Booster feature increases your stake by 50% but removes the low-value symbols from the Mystery Symbol feature, making it only reveal high-value symbols or wild symbols.

It features a steampunk theme and has a portrait-focused layout. The game has a Mystery Symbols feature that can turn into any symbol, including the wild symbol. There is also an optional Win Booster feature where you can play 50% more per spin but remove low-value symbols from the Mystery Symbols feature. The Free Spins feature is the main attraction, where you can get up to 5 Mystery Reels that can bring up to 3 wild reels on every free spin.\n\nTheme and Visuals\n\nFortunium has a Victorian-era steampunk theme, set in a world of mechanical masterpieces and alchemical artwork. The game features an impressive cityscape in the background, reminiscent of some sci-fi films. Reels are bordered with elaborate designs, and symbols include clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades, plasma guns, airships, treasure chests, and two characters: Maximillian and Victoria. The game's aesthetic appeal is high, and the graphics perfectly complement the theme. The game is more enjoyable in portrait mode, especially on mobile devices.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nFortunium offers several special features. The Mystery Symbols feature is triggered when the Mystery Symbols land on the reels – they then reveal a randomly selected low, high, or wild symbol. The Win Booster feature can be activated at any time and will cost you 50% more per spin, but you'll remove the chance for the Mystery Symbol to reveal low-value symbols. This means that the Mystery Symbols feature will only reveal high-value symbols or wild symbols. The Free Spins feature is triggered by getting 3, 4, or 5 scatters anywhere on the reels, and you'll receive 10 free spins. Each additional scatter gives you an extra free spin. Additionally, 3, 4, or 5 scatters on a free spin will give you 1, 2, or 3 Mystery Reels that contain only the Mystery Symbols. This can allow you to get up to 3 full wild reels on every free spin, improving your chances of winning up to 800x your stake.\n\nMystery Symbols\n\nFortunium features a Mystery Symbols feature that can be triggered during any spin. When the Mystery Symbols land on the reels, they will reveal a randomly chosen low, high, or wild symbol. This feature can be particularly useful as the Mystery Symbol can turn into the wild symbol, which can significantly increase your chances of getting a winning combination.\n\nWin Booster\n\nThe Win Booster feature is an optional feature that can be activated at any time by the player. It costs 50% more per spin, but it removes the chance for the Mystery Symbol to reveal low-value symbols, which increases the chances of revealing high-value symbols or wild symbols instead. This feature can be particularly useful if you're looking for bigger wins and are willing to make a larger investment.\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nThe main attraction of Fortunium is the Free Spins feature, which is triggered when you get 3, 4, or 5 scatters anywhere on the reels. You will then receive 10 free spins, and each additional scatter you get during the feature will give you an extra free spin. When triggered, the Free Spins feature can give you up to 3 Mystery Reels on each free spin, and these reels contain only the Mystery Symbols. This can allow you to get up to 3 full wild reels on every free spin and improve your chances of winning up to 800x your stake.\n\nWild Reels\n\nFortunium features a wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the scatter. During the Free Spins feature, you can get up to 3 mystery reels on each free spin, and these reels contain only the Mystery Symbols. This can allow you to get up to 3 full wild reels on every free spin, significantly increasing your chances of getting a winning combination. The Wild Reels feature can be particularly useful during the Free Spins feature, where you can get up to 30 free spins if you trigger the feature with 5 scatters.\n\n        \n            ",

This portrait-focused game has a steampunk theme and features a Mystery Symbols feature that can turn into any symbol, including the wild. There is an optional Win Booster feature where you play 50% more per spin, but remove low-value symbols from the Mystery Symbols feature. The main attraction is the Free Spins feature where you can get up to 3 Mystery Reels that can bring up to 3 wild reels on every free spin.\nTransport yourself to a retro-style sci-fi world and discover what our review of the exciting Fortunium online slot machine has to offer. Victorian-style characters named Maximillian and Victoria are just a couple of the steampunk-themed images you'll see on this Microgaming five-reel, 40-line slot machine.\nComplex weapons, airships, and an elaborately designed treasure chest are symbols that add to this distinctive game's aesthetic appeal. It has some outstanding bonuses that complement its great looks, with wild substitutions, symbol transformations, and free spins with richer reels for your enjoyment. An optional Win Booster feature adds high-value symbols to the mix and extra money to your bankroll.\nPurely steampunk graphics\nFortunium is a 5-reel, 5-row, 40-payline slot from Microgaming that can be played from 10 cents to €125 per spin on all devices. With a steampunk theme, it comes with stacks of mystery symbols that can turn into another symbol as well as a Win Booster feature where you can add a bet to remove low-value symbols that appear in the Mystery Symbols feature. There is also a Free Spins feature where you can get up to 5 Mystery Reels on each free spin.\nFortunium takes you to the golden city of opportunities and has a steampunk theme, set in a world of mechanical masterpieces and alchemical artwork. This game is much more enjoyable in portrait mode on mobile/smartphones but can also be played on desktop and tablet.\nThe city behind the reels looks like something out of The Fifth Element or some of the Star Wars movies, where the vast Coruscant towers have risen miles into the sky. It's an impressive sight, but let's focus on the reels with an elaborate border because that's where all the action takes place in the Fortunium online slot. Each of the five reels has five symbols, and prizes are won by matching any type of symbol on a payline from left to right.\nSlot machine functions and symbols\nWhen it comes to symbols, you have clubs, hearts, diamonds, and spades, as well as plasma guns, airships, treasure chests, and 2 characters: Maximillian and Victoria. Both of these symbols are stacked vertically five high, while all other symbols appear in double stack. There is also a wild character that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\nIn terms of bonuses, there is a Mystery Symbols feature that is played when the Mystery Symbols land on the reels – they open up to reveal a randomly chosen low, high, or wild symbol.\nEven more importantly, Fortunium comes with a Win Booster feature that you decide when to use – it will cost you 50% more per spin (i.e., from 10 cents to 15 cents per spin on minimum bets) but removes the chance for the Mystery Symbol to reveal low-value symbols. This means that the Mystery Symbols feature will only reveal high-value symbols or wild symbols.\nFortunium also comes with a Free Spins feature that is played when you get 3, 4, or 5 scatters anywhere on the reels – you will then receive 10 free spins. Each additional scatter you get during the feature will give you an extra free spin.\nNow, 3, 4, or 5 scatters will give you 1, 2, or 3 Mystery Reels on each free spin, respectively – the Mystery Reels contain only the Mystery Symbols, meaning you could end up with 3 Full Wild Reels on every free spin! As a result, this will improve your chances of winning up to 800 times your stake on each spin.\nFortunium is a medium variance slot with balanced wins – the Win Booster feature can be useful as it reveals high-value or wild symbols only during the Mystery Symbols feature, but it's actually the Free Spins feature that matters.\nOther similar slot machines\nIf you like the steampunk theme, we recommend NetEnt's Steam Tower and Yggdrasil Gaming's Cazino Zeppelin slot machines. Cazino Zeppelin, produced by Yggdrasil Gaming, has an unusual theme as it is set on a 1930s airship. This high-variance game is also about the Free Spins feature, where you can start with a maximum of 20 free spins with the wilds that you have when you activate the feature becoming sticky throughout the feature. Additionally, each new wild will also become a sticky wild that will remain throughout the feature, hoping to i\u0002ncrease your chances of getting dizzying wins.\n            ",

This portrait-focused game has a steampunk theme and features a Mystery Symbols feature that can turn into any symbol, including the wild. There is an optional Win Booster feature where you play 50% more per spin, but remove low-value symbols from the Mystery Symbols feature. The main attraction is the Free Spins feature where you can get up to 3 Mystery Reels that can bring up to 3 wild reels on every free spin.\nTransport yourself to a retro-style sci-fi world and discover what our review of the exciting Fortunium online slot machine has to offer. Victorian-style characters named Maximillian and Victoria are just a couple of the steampunk-themed images you'll see on this Microgaming five-reel, 40-line slot machine.\nComplex weapons, airships, and an elaborately designed treasure chest are symbols that add to this distinctive game's aesthetic appeal. It has some outstanding bonuses that complement its great looks, with wild substitutions, symbol transformations, and free spins with richer reels for your enjoyment. An optional Win Booster feature adds high-value symbols to the mix and extra money to your bankroll.\nPurely steampunk graphics\nFortunium is a 5-reel, 5-row, 40-payline slot from Microgaming that can be played from 10 cents to €125 per spin on all devices. With a steampunk theme, it comes with stacks of mystery symbols that can turn into another symbol as well as a Win Booster feature where you can add a bet to remove low-value symbols that appear in the Mystery Symbols feature. There is also a Free Spins feature where you can get up to 5 Mystery Reels on each free spin.\nFortunium takes you to the golden city of opportunities and has a steampunk theme, set in a world of mechanical masterpieces and alchemical artwork. This game is much more enjoyable in portrait mode on mobile/smartphones but can also be played on desktop and tablet.\nThe city behind the reels looks like something out of The Fifth Element or some of the Star Wars movies, where the vast Coruscant towers have risen miles into the sky. It's an impressive sight, but let's focus on the reels with an elaborate border because that's where all the action takes place in the Fortunium online slot. Each of the five reels has five symbols, and prizes are won by matching any type of symbol on a payline from left to right.\nSlot machine functions and symbols\nWhen it comes to symbols, you have clubs, hearts, diamonds, and spades, as well as plasma guns, airships, treasure chests, and 2 characters: Maximillian and Victoria. Both of these symbols are stacked vertically five high, while all other symbols appear in double stack. There is also a wild character that replaces all symbols except the scatter.\nIn terms of bonuses, there is a Mystery Symbols feature that is played when the Mystery Symbols land on the reels – they open up to reveal a randomly chosen low, high, or wild symbol.\nEven more importantly, Fortunium comes with a Win Booster feature that you decide when to use – it will cost you 50% more per spin (i.e., from 10 cents to 15 cents per spin on minimum bets) but removes the chance for the Mystery Symbol to reveal low-value symbols. This means that the Mystery Symbols feature will only reveal high-value symbols or wild symbols.\nFortunium also comes with a Free Spins feature that is played when you get 3, 4, or 5 scatters anywhere on the reels – you will then receive 10 free spins. Each additional scatter you get during the feature will give you an extra free spin.\nNow, 3, 4, or 5 scatters will give you 1, 2, or 3 Mystery Reels on each free spin, respectively – the Mystery Reels contain only the Mystery Symbols, meaning you could end up with 3 Full Wild Reels on every free spin! As a result, this will improve your chances of winning up to 800 times your stake on each spin.\nFortunium is a medium variance slot with balanced wins – the Win Booster feature can be useful as it reveals high-value or wild symbols only during the Mystery Symbols feature, but it's actually the Free Spins feature that matters.\nOther similar slot machines\nIf you like the steampunk theme, we recommend NetEnt's Steam Tower and Yggdrasil Gaming's Cazino Zeppelin slot machines. Cazino Zeppelin, produced by Yggdrasil Gaming, has an unusual theme as it is set on a 1930s airship. This high-variance game is also about the Free Spins feature, where you can start with a maximum of 20 free spins with the wilds that you have when you activate the feature becoming sticky throughout the feature. Additionally, each new wild will also become a sticky wild that will remain throughout the feature, hoping to i\u0002ncrease your chances of getting dizzying wins.\n            ",
