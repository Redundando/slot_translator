The game has a 5x4 grid with 178 paylines, providing more winning chances than the standard on the market. The Wild symbol replaces all necessary symbols to allow players to create a winning combination on one of the paylines, while the Bull and the Matador, when they appear together, offer a Wild symbol that extends across the entire reel, leading to many more wins.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nThe graphical interface of Wild Toro has a Spanish-style feel and is impressive. The slot machine appears as a 5x4 grid with semi-transparent reels that allow players to enjoy the classic bullfighting background. The symbols are beautifully crafted, especially the bull symbol that has human features, including a 32-teeth smile. The Wild symbol has interesting animations, but the secondary symbols such as the rose and the orange pierced by a knife are masterfully designed, lifting the entire theme to a higher level.\n\nNumber of Paylines\n\nWild Toro boasts a 5x4 grid with 178 paylines, which is a considerably larger number compared to the standard on the market. This provides players with many more chances of winning in general, making this game suitable for both high rollers and players on a budget.\n\nWilds and Winning Combinations\n\nThe Wild symbol in Wild Toro is represented by a golden Wild Toro sign with beautiful animations, appearing in a very intuitive way. Players can use this symbol to replace all necessary symbols to allow them to make a winning combination on one of the paylines. The Bull and the Matador add an exciting element to the game, offering a Wild symbol that extends across the entire reel when they appear together. This feature leads to many more wins, making the game much more engaging and enjoyable.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP)\n\nWild Toro by Elk has an RTP of 96.40%, which is in line with the market average and set at a decent level. This means that players have a good chance of winning big with this game. El Torero, another slot machine with a similar theme, has an RTP of 96%, but is older and has graphics that suffer in comparison to Wild Toro. Overall, Wild Toro is a great choice for players looking for a thrilling slot machine experience with big payouts.\n\n        \n            ",

Other times, however, they can make you sink into a dark and gloomy feeling, when the main object of the slot is something scary or that is able to instill fear. Fortunately, this time we are not in such a situation. We are going to talk about an engaging slot machine, thanks to its modern graphics and its theme, namely bullfighting, one of the most fascinating and spectacular pastimes in the world. Keep reading to find out more!\n\nA Spanish-style graphical interface\nWild Toro is a slot machine produced by Elk. We do not want to underestimate this production house, but it is no secret that it is not one of the big names in the industry, such as NetEnt or Playtech. However, from the graphics, it is already clear that Elk has invested a lot in this slot machine. The slot game appears as a 5x4 grid, but it is definitely not the classic reels. These are in fact semi-transparent and allow you to see the background, which features the classic bullring. The symbols are very nice to look at, especially the bull symbol that is shown with human features, with its 32-teeth smile. The Wild symbol has interesting animations, but nothing comparable to the secondary symbols, such as the rose and the orange pierced by a knife. These are masterfully drawn and elevate the entire context to a decidedly higher level.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the slot machine\nWild Toro by Elk was judged game of the year in 2017. It is no coincidence that the slot machine received this recognition. Thanks to a perfect combination of beautiful graphics and functions that, albeit basic, allow you to win a lot of money, Wild Toro has stood out. First of all, it should be noted that the 5x4 grid provides 178 paylines. This is a considerably larger number compared to the standard on the market. You will have many more chances of winning in general. Of course, there is the Wild symbol, represented in a very intuitive way by a golden Wild Toro sign with beautiful animations. Like all Wild symbols, it replaces all the necessary symbols to allow you to make a winning combination on one of the paylines. Particularly interesting for your winnings is the presence of the Bull and the Matador. As you well know, they chase each other in the bullring and in the same way they chase each other on the reels when they appear together. In this case, you will find a Wild symbol that extends across the entire reel. Many, many more wins.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nAnother slot machine with a practically identical theme is El Torero. Of course, this is an older slot machine compared to Wild Toro, so the graphics suffer. In any case, the RTP is set at 96%, so you can have big wins.\n\nFrequently asked questions\nCan I try it on my smartphone without an app?\nYes, just use your phone's browser, without the need to register or download anything.\n\nWhat are its strengths?\nThe lively graphics, its classic 5x4 grid and the 178 paylines.\n\nDoes the slot have a high RTP?\nYes, in line with the market average and set at 96.40%.\n            ",

Other times, however, they can make you sink into a dark and gloomy feeling, when the main object of the slot is something scary or that is able to instill fear. Fortunately, this time we are not in such a situation. We are going to talk about an engaging slot machine, thanks to its modern graphics and its theme, namely bullfighting, one of the most fascinating and spectacular pastimes in the world. Keep reading to find out more!\n\nA Spanish-style graphical interface\nWild Toro is a slot machine produced by Elk. We do not want to underestimate this production house, but it is no secret that it is not one of the big names in the industry, such as NetEnt or Playtech. However, from the graphics, it is already clear that Elk has invested a lot in this slot machine. The slot game appears as a 5x4 grid, but it is definitely not the classic reels. These are in fact semi-transparent and allow you to see the background, which features the classic bullring. The symbols are very nice to look at, especially the bull symbol that is shown with human features, with its 32-teeth smile. The Wild symbol has interesting animations, but nothing comparable to the secondary symbols, such as the rose and the orange pierced by a knife. These are masterfully drawn and elevate the entire context to a decidedly higher level.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the slot machine\nWild Toro by Elk was judged game of the year in 2017. It is no coincidence that the slot machine received this recognition. Thanks to a perfect combination of beautiful graphics and functions that, albeit basic, allow you to win a lot of money, Wild Toro has stood out. First of all, it should be noted that the 5x4 grid provides 178 paylines. This is a considerably larger number compared to the standard on the market. You will have many more chances of winning in general. Of course, there is the Wild symbol, represented in a very intuitive way by a golden Wild Toro sign with beautiful animations. Like all Wild symbols, it replaces all the necessary symbols to allow you to make a winning combination on one of the paylines. Particularly interesting for your winnings is the presence of the Bull and the Matador. As you well know, they chase each other in the bullring and in the same way they chase each other on the reels when they appear together. In this case, you will find a Wild symbol that extends across the entire reel. Many, many more wins.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nAnother slot machine with a practically identical theme is El Torero. Of course, this is an older slot machine compared to Wild Toro, so the graphics suffer. In any case, the RTP is set at 96%, so you can have big wins.\n\nFrequently asked questions\nCan I try it on my smartphone without an app?\nYes, just use your phone's browser, without the need to register or download anything.\n\nWhat are its strengths?\nThe lively graphics, its classic 5x4 grid and the 178 paylines.\n\nDoes the slot have a high RTP?\nYes, in line with the market average and set at 96.40%.\n            ",
