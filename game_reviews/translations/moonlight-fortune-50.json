Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nMoonlight Fortune 50\nDesign and Theme\nGameplay and Bet Limits\nSymbols and Payouts\nBonus Features and Free Spins\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Moonlight Fortune 50\nMoonlight Fortune 50, brought to you by Synot, features a moon-worshipping warrior woman as its main character and offers a potential win of up to €250,000!\n\nTheme and Graphics\nIn this stunning slot game by Synot, players embark on a journey into the night, accompanied by a fierce warrior woman and creatures of the night like owls, rabbits, wolves, and even unicorns.\n\nThe first thing to notice about Moonlight Fortune 50 is the fusion of Norse and Western mythology, as the warrior woman reminds us of the Greek goddess of hunting, Artemis, who is responsible for the initiation of young women into the cult of the moon. At the same time, she has pointed ears characteristic of elves and a long sword that seems to be of Viking origin.\n\nWe are faced with a beautifully designed game. The graphics are superb, the symbols are well-drawn and rich in detail, like the roots forming the letters of the playing cards or the falling leaves on either side of the grid.\n\nThe spaces that accommodate the buttons are well-organized, making everything easily accessible with a simple click. The relaxing music playing in the background is a great addition that conveys calmness and serenity.\n\nHow Moonlight Fortune 50 Works\nThe simple 5×4 grid features 50 fixed paylines on which players can build their combos. To win, you must match at least three identical adjacent symbols, starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. But first, you must choose the amount of your bet, which starts from a minimum of €0.10 and can go up to €100.\n\nWith the Autoplay function, you can set the reels to spin for a predetermined number of spins ranging from 10 to 1,000. The mode concludes by clicking the Stop Autoplay button or when triggering Free Spins.\n\nMoonlight Fortune 50 has medium volatility and an RTP of 95.02%.\n\nHow to Win at Moonlight Fortune 50\nNow let's see how much you can win with this game. Moonlight Fortune 50 features six low-level symbols represented by playing cards (nine to ace) and four high-level symbols that are then the thematic symbols. The rabbit and the owl pay up to four times your bet, the wolf pays six times, and the unicorn, among the regular symbols, is the most generous, rewarding you with an amount equal to eight times your initial bet. To get a precise idea of the amounts paid out, you can access the Payments table by clicking on the menu button to the right of the grid.\n\nThe girl is our Wild symbol and, in addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, pays up to ten times the initial bet.\n\nThe moon is the Bonus symbol, and you need three of them to get six free spins and a x2 multiplier. During Free Spins, the first and last reels are covered with two expanding Sticky Wilds that remain active throughout the entire function.\n\nThere is also the Gamble option that allows us to bet after each win. By accepting the challenge, you can double your winnings, but you could also lose everything.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the game's volatility?\nThe game's volatility is medium.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player (RTP) rate?\nMoonlight Fortune 50 has an RTP of 95.02%.\n            ",

At the same time, she has pointed ears characteristic of elves and a long sword that seems to be of Viking origin.\n\nWe are faced with a beautifully designed game. The graphics are superb, the symbols are well-drawn and rich in detail, like the roots forming the letters of the playing cards or the falling leaves on either side of the grid.\n\nThe spaces that accommodate the buttons are well-organized, making everything easily accessible with a simple click. The relaxing music playing in the background is a great addition that conveys calmness and serenity.\n\nHow Moonlight Fortune 50 Works\nThe simple 5×4 grid features 50 fixed paylines on which players can build their combos.

At the same time, she has pointed ears characteristic of elves and a long sword that seems to be of Viking origin.\n\nWe are faced with a beautifully designed game. The graphics are superb, the symbols are well-drawn and rich in detail, like the roots forming the letters of the playing cards or the falling leaves on either side of the grid.\n\nThe spaces that accommodate the buttons are well-organized, making everything easily accessible with a simple click. The relaxing music playing in the background is a great addition that conveys calmness and serenity.\n\nHow Moonlight Fortune 50 Works\nThe simple 5×4 grid features 50 fixed paylines on which players can build their combos. To win, you must match at least three identical adjacent symbols, starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. But first, you must choose the amount of your bet, which starts from a minimum of €0.10 and can go up to €100.\n\nWith the Autoplay function, you can set the reels to spin for a predetermined number of spins ranging from 10 to 1,000. The mode concludes by clicking the Stop Autoplay button or when triggering Free Spins.\n\nMoonlight Fortune 50 has medium volatility and an RTP of 95.02%.\n\nHow to Win at Moonlight Fortune 50\nNow let's see how much you can win with this game. Moonlight Fortune 50 features six low-level symbols represented by playing cards (nine to ace) and four high-level symbols that are then the thematic symbols. The rabbit and the owl pay up to four times your bet, the wolf pays six times, and the unicorn, among the regular symbols, is the most generous, rewarding you with an amount equal to eight times your initial bet. To get a precise idea of the amounts paid out, you can access the Payments table by clicking on the menu button to the right of the grid.\n\nThe girl is our Wild symbol and, in addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, pays up to ten times the initial bet.\n\nThe moon is the Bonus symbol, and you need three of them to get six free spins and a x2 multiplier. During Free Spins, the first and last reels are covered with two expanding Sticky Wilds that remain active throughout the entire function.\n\nThere is also the Gamble option that allows us to bet after each win. By accepting the challenge, you can double your winnings, but you could also lose everything.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the game's volatility?\nThe game's volatility is medium.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player (RTP) rate?\nMoonlight Fortune 50 has an RTP of 95.02%.\n            ",
