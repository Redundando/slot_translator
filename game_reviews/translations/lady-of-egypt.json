The theme of ancient Egypt permeates the entire slot, not just with regards to the symbols found within the game grid (which display tastefully illustrated graphics) but also in the music that plays during the game and during the bonus mode.\n\nHowever, WMS has introduced a new feature with this slot: a unique game grid. \n\nHow to Play Lady of Egypt\n\nWMS has made it their policy to associate slots with traditional appearances and mechanics with slots that are unique in their kind. We'll see other similar titles in the next part of our review, but for now let's take a look at what makes Lady of Egypt so unique.\n\nWhile most online slots use a 5x3 mechanism that shows fifteen symbols on each play, in this case we see a mechanism that is unique in its kind.

This particular mechanism not only makes gameplay more fun, but also offers the chance to win big thanks to the presence of Wild and Scatter symbols and multipliers.\n\nIf the first three reel win is not affected by subsequent wins, the second winning combination will receive a 2x multiplier on its value. In the third, the multiplier increases to 3x, and in the fourth (just before the jackpot), it reaches 5x. \n\nSlots similar to Lady of Egypt\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, this isn't the first time that WMS has offered slots with unique and unusual gameplay. The same (although for different reasons) can be said for Fire Queen and Giant's Gold.\n\nIf we want to talk about the theme and not the gameplay, Egypt is particularly dear to this development house, from Egyption Riches to Rome & Egypt, as well as other houses like Novomatic and the famous title Book of Ra.\n            ",

It features two of the most famous Egyptian figures: Cleopatra and Nefertiti.\n\nUnique 9x3 grid system\n\nLady of Egypt's game grid features a 9x3 system with 9 reels that spin simultaneously. The game interface shifts two reels to the right once a winning combination is obtained in the first three reels, and this process is repeated until the last reel, where the jackpot can be won. This mechanism not only makes gameplay more fun but also offers increasing multipliers with each win, starting from 2x and reaching 5x just before the jackpot.\n\nIncreasing multipliers with each win\n\nIf subsequent wins are not affected, the second winning combination is multiplied by 2x, the third by 3x, and the fourth by 5x, thereby increasing the chance to win big. Lady of Egypt also features Wild and Scatter symbols, enhancing the player's chance to win.\n\nComparison to other WMS slots\n\nWMS has a reputation for offering unique and unusual gameplay in their online slots, and Lady of Egypt is no exception. Similar slots with unique gameplay include Fire Queen and Giant's Gold. However, when it comes to ancient Egypt-themed slots, WMS has several options, including Egyptian Riches and Rome & Egypt.

After all, this country and its history contain everything we look for in a slot: mystery, riches and charm.\n\nIt's these same three characteristics that define some of the most famous women of all time: Cleopatra and Nefertiti, figures to whom WMS has dedicated Lady of Egypt.\n\nIn this short review, we'll shed some light on this slot from both a graphical and gameplay perspective. \n\nGraphics and Sound of Lady of Egypt\n\nWe'll never tire of saying it: the eye also wants its share, which is why we always start by talking about this aspect. The theme of ancient Egypt permeates the entire slot, not just with regards to the symbols found within the game grid (which display tastefully illustrated graphics) but also in the music that plays during the game and during the bonus mode.\n\nHowever, WMS has introduced a new feature with this slot: a unique game grid. \n\nHow to Play Lady of Egypt\n\nWMS has made it their policy to associate slots with traditional appearances and mechanics with slots that are unique in their kind. We'll see other similar titles in the next part of our review, but for now let's take a look at what makes Lady of Egypt so unique.\n\nWhile most online slots use a 5x3 mechanism that shows fifteen symbols on each play, in this case we see a mechanism that is unique in its kind. We could define Lady of Egypt's grid as a 9x3 system with 9 reels that spin simultaneously.\n\nIn reality, our game will only focus on three reels at a time: once a winning combination is obtained in the first three reels, the game interface will shift two reels to the right, where we will have the chance to obtain a combined win. \n\nThe process is repeated until we reach the last reel (which is special in its ability to assign the jackpot) or until there are no more winning combinations. This particular mechanism not only makes gameplay more fun, but also offers the chance to win big thanks to the presence of Wild and Scatter symbols and multipliers.\n\nIf the first three reel win is not affected by subsequent wins, the second winning combination will receive a 2x multiplier on its value. In the third, the multiplier increases to 3x, and in the fourth (just before the jackpot), it reaches 5x. \n\nSlots similar to Lady of Egypt\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, this isn't the first time that WMS has offered slots with unique and unusual gameplay. The same (although for different reasons) can be said for Fire Queen and Giant's Gold.\n\nIf we want to talk about the theme and not the gameplay, Egypt is particularly dear to this development house, from Egyption Riches to Rome & Egypt, as well as other houses like Novomatic and the famous title Book of Ra.\n            ",
