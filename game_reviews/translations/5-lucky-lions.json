    "original_text": "\n5 Lucky Lions\nIn occasione del Capodanno cinese è possibile assistere per le strade delle città alla danza del leone: una o due persone animano un enorme pupazzo dai colori sgargianti e camminano tra la folla regalando sorrisi a bambini e adulti. Questa danza affonda le radici storiche nella leggenda: il leone infatti era capace di scacciare i mostri e le sciagure che colpivano i villaggi, diventando poi nei secoli simbolo di fortuna, buoni auspici e prosperità. La nuova slot di Habanero celebra questa tradizione con una slot dalla grafica impeccabile e un gameplay abbastanza semplice, adatto ad ogni tipo di giocatore. Nella schermata di gioco troviamo i rulli contornati da una cornice d’oro, mentre sullo sfondo abbiamo un tempio e le statue del leone e del drago, altro simbolo di primaria importanza per la cultura orientale. I simboli, ricchi di dettagli, sono mossi da animazioni che riproducono una vera e propria danza. La musica orientaleggiante ha l’importante ruolo di dare ancora più spessore all’atmosfera di festa.\nSotto la griglia di gioco troviamo tutti le informazioni relative alla nostra scommessa, dalla puntata totale al valore del gettone, dal saldo delle vincite al tasto spin e a quello per dare avvio ai giri automatici.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nLa griglia usata in 5 Lucky Lions ha 6 rulli e 4 righe, con 88 linee di pagamento fisse. La puntata minima parte da 0,01 € per linea, ciò vuol dire che ogni Spin ha il costo di 0,88 €, mentre per quel che riguarda la puntata massima totale è di 88 €. Attraverso il simbolo del fulmine che si trova in basso a sinistra si può accelerare la rotazione dei rulli, inoltre si possono attivare tra i 10 e i 500 giri automatici. L’RTP è pari al 96,79%.\nSimboli e funzionalità di 5 Lucky Lions\nPossiamo dividere i simboli in “Simboli vincite basse” e “Simboli vincite alte”. Il primo gruppo è costituito dalle carte da gioco dal 9 all’Asso, il secondo è caratterizzato dai 5 leoni. In ordine di valore, abbiamo il verde, il viola, il giallo, il rosa e il rosso. Il simbolo Wild è il piccolo bonzo con i piatti d’acciaio in mano che, oltre a determinare delle vincite, sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter. Lo Scatter è rappresentato dal tamburo, anch’esso ricompensa se appare da 3 sino a un massimo di 6 volte in qualsiasi posizione, ma soprattutto regala giri gratis in quella che viene definita “funzione Bonus Pick”. Quando 3 o più simboli Scatter compaiono sui rulli, vi verrà data la possibilità di scegliere uno dei leoni a cui sono associati dei giri gratuiti di numero variabile, in base al valore del simbolo. Per capirci, il leone rosso paga di più e quindi avremo 8 giri gratuiti, il viola che paga meno del rosso offre 10 giri, il giallo 12, il viola 15 e il verde, quello di minor valore ne offre 18. Durante i Free Spins apparirà solo il leone che abbiamo scelto e prima di ogni giro esso verrà impilato in un rullo casuale. Durante i Free Spins non può apparire il simbolo Scatter.\n",

In addition to generating winnings, it replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by a drum and rewards players when it appears from 3 to 6 times in any position. More interestingly, it triggers free spins in what is called the \"Bonus Pick\" feature. When 3 or more Scatter symbols appear on the reels, you'll be given the chance to choose one of the lions associated with a variable number of free spins, depending on the lion's value. For example, the red lion pays the most and offers 8 free spins, while the purple, the least valuable lion, offers 18 spins. During free spins, only the chosen lion appears, and before each spin, it will be stacked on a random reel. The Scatter symbol cannot appear during free spins."

The oriental music gives further depth to the festive atmosphere.\nBelow the game reels, you'll find all the relevant information about your bet, from the total wager to the coin value, winnings balance, spin button, and auto-spin activation button.\nKey Features of the Slot Machine\nThe grid used in 5 Lucky Lions has 6 reels and 4 rows, with 88 fixed paylines. The minimum bet starts at €0.01 per line, meaning each spin costs €0.88, while the overall maximum bet is €88. The lightning symbol in the lower left corner can accelerate reel speed. You can also activate between 10 and 500 automatic spins. The RTP is 96.79%.\nSymbols and Features of 5 Lucky Lions\nThe symbols can be divided into \"Low Win Symbols\" and \"High Win Symbols.\" The former are the standard playing cards from 9 to Ace, while the latter feature the 5 lions. They are, in order of value, green, purple, yellow, pink, and red. The Wild symbol is the little bonze holding steel plates. In addition to generating winnings, it replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by a drum and rewards players when it appears from 3 to 6 times in any position. More interestingly, it triggers free spins in what is called the \"Bonus Pick\" feature. When 3 or more Scatter symbols appear on the reels, you'll be given the chance to choose one of the lions associated with a variable number of free spins, depending on the lion's value. For example, the red lion pays the most and offers 8 free spins, while the purple, the least valuable lion, offers 18 spins. During free spins, only the chosen lion appears, and before each spin, it will be stacked on a random reel. The Scatter symbol cannot appear during free spins.\n            ",

This energetic dance, performed by one or two individuals animating a large colorful lion puppet, brings joy to children and adults alike as they wander through the crowds. The roots of this dance are steeped in legend, with the lion being a symbol of fortune, good luck and prosperity in Chinese culture for centuries due to its ability to ward off monsters and disasters that befell villages. The new Habanero slot celebrates this tradition with impeccable graphics and simple gameplay suitable for any player. The game's reels are surrounded by a golden frame, with a temple and statues of both the lion and dragon - another important symbol in Eastern culture - in the background. The symbols, each richly detailed, move with animations that mimic a real dance. The oriental music gives further depth to the festive atmosphere.\nBelow the game reels, you'll find all the relevant information about your bet, from the total wager to the coin value, winnings balance, spin button, and auto-spin activation button.\nKey Features of the Slot Machine\nThe grid used in 5 Lucky Lions has 6 reels and 4 rows, with 88 fixed paylines. The minimum bet starts at €0.01 per line, meaning each spin costs €0.88, while the overall maximum bet is €88. The lightning symbol in the lower left corner can accelerate reel speed. You can also activate between 10 and 500 automatic spins. The RTP is 96.79%.\nSymbols and Features of 5 Lucky Lions\nThe symbols can be divided into \"Low Win Symbols\" and \"High Win Symbols.\" The former are the standard playing cards from 9 to Ace, while the latter feature the 5 lions. They are, in order of value, green, purple, yellow, pink, and red. The Wild symbol is the little bonze holding steel plates. In addition to generating winnings, it replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by a drum and rewards players when it appears from 3 to 6 times in any position. More interestingly, it triggers free spins in what is called the \"Bonus Pick\" feature. When 3 or more Scatter symbols appear on the reels, you'll be given the chance to choose one of the lions associated with a variable number of free spins, depending on the lion's value. For example, the red lion pays the most and offers 8 free spins, while the purple, the least valuable lion, offers 18 spins. During free spins, only the chosen lion appears, and before each spin, it will be stacked on a random reel. The Scatter symbol cannot appear during free spins.\n            ",

This energetic dance, performed by one or two individuals animating a large colorful lion puppet, brings joy to children and adults alike as they wander through the crowds. The roots of this dance are steeped in legend, with the lion being a symbol of fortune, good luck and prosperity in Chinese culture for centuries due to its ability to ward off monsters and disasters that befell villages. The new Habanero slot celebrates this tradition with impeccable graphics and simple gameplay suitable for any player. The game's reels are surrounded by a golden frame, with a temple and statues of both the lion and dragon - another important symbol in Eastern culture - in the background. The symbols, each richly detailed, move with animations that mimic a real dance. The oriental music gives further depth to the festive atmosphere.\nBelow the game reels, you'll find all the relevant information about your bet, from the total wager to the coin value, winnings balance, spin button, and auto-spin activation button.\nKey Features of the Slot Machine\nThe grid used in 5 Lucky Lions has 6 reels and 4 rows, with 88 fixed paylines. The minimum bet starts at €0.01 per line, meaning each spin costs €0.88, while the overall maximum bet is €88. The lightning symbol in the lower left corner can accelerate reel speed. You can also activate between 10 and 500 automatic spins. The RTP is 96.79%.\nSymbols and Features of 5 Lucky Lions\nThe symbols can be divided into \"Low Win Symbols\" and \"High Win Symbols.\" The former are the standard playing cards from 9 to Ace, while the latter feature the 5 lions. They are, in order of value, green, purple, yellow, pink, and red. The Wild symbol is the little bonze holding steel plates. In addition to generating winnings, it replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by a drum and rewards players when it appears from 3 to 6 times in any position. More interestingly, it triggers free spins in what is called the \"Bonus Pick\" feature. When 3 or more Scatter symbols appear on the reels, you'll be given the chance to choose one of the lions associated with a variable number of free spins, depending on the lion's value. For example, the red lion pays the most and offers 8 free spins, while the purple, the least valuable lion, offers 18 spins. During free spins, only the chosen lion appears, and before each spin, it will be stacked on a random reel. The Scatter symbol cannot appear during free spins.\n            ",
