    "original_text": "\nJinns Moon\nSali sul tappeto volante insieme alla splendida Jasmine e al simpatico Abu, grazie a Jinns Moon potrai entrare anche tu nel magico mondo delle “Mille e una notte”!\nTema e grafica\nQuesta slot nata dalla sinergia tra Rarestone Gaming e Playtech, è ispirata ai racconti delle Mille e una notte e più in particolare alla fiaba “Aladino e la lampada meravigliosa”. La storia è nota, ma per chi non la ricordasse forse è il caso di ricordarla brevemente. Aladino è un giovane senza lavoro che viene costretto da un mago a scendere sottoterra per recuperare una lampada a olio. Dopo essere rimasto intrappolato, Aladino riesce a fuggire grazie all’aiuto del genio della lampada. Tornato nella sua città, si innamora della figlia dell’imperatore, il cui nome significa Luna piena delle lune piene.\nEd è proprio la luna uno dei simboli più importanti del gioco. Prima di parlare del gameplay, vogliamo spendere parole sulla grafica. Vista l’ambientazione della slot, i colori non possono che tendere all’arancione del deserto presente sullo sfondo. I simboli sono ricchi di dettagli e si animano a seguito di vincite o bonus mentre un sottofondo musicale orientaleggiante ci accompagna durante tutto il gioco. Sotto i rulli troviamo tutte le informazioni sulla scommessa e i tasti per settare a meglio le impostazioni.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia di giochi ha una struttura tradizionale con 5 rulli e 3 righe. Le 50 linee di pagamento sono fisse, con la puntata minima che è di 0,25 € per spin sino a un massimo di 500 €. È possibile attivare tra 5 e 100 giri automatici, che possono essere disattivati in ogni momento. Jinns Moon ha un ottimo RTP pari al 96,58% e volatilità alta.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nIn questa slot sono presenti diversi bonus e 3 Jackpot di livello. Prima però vediamo quali sono i simboli e quanto possiamo vincere grazie a essi. Le carte da gioco dal 10 all’asso sono naturalmente quelle che ripagano meno, seguiti dalla scimitarra, dal tappeto volante e dal pentolone colmo di oro. La scimmietta è il simbolo con il valore più alto. La principessa è il nostro Wild, sostituisce tutti i simboli tranne lo Scatter e può comparire solo sui rulli 2, 3, 4 e 5 durante il gioco regolare. Se vediamo comparire la principessa su 5 slot, allora avremo diritto a un moltiplicatore 75x. Lo Scatter è la lampada magica, se compare almeno 3 volte otterremo 8 partite gratuite oltre a una somma di denaro. La luna piena è il nostro simbolo Bonus, può comparire su tutti i rulli e ci garantisce un moltiplicatore compreso tra 1x e 50x, oltre a dare vita al Fire Blaze Jackpot. In questo caso vengono assegnati 3 giri gratuiti durante i quali i simboli bonus che hanno attivato la funzione rimangono bloccati sui rulli. A ogni giro successivo compare o un premio in denaro o una luna con una stella del jackpot. Se alla fine dei Respin i rulli sono interamente ricoperti dalle lune, allora vinceremo il Grand Jackpot, ossia la puntata totale moltiplicata per 2.000. In caso contrario, le lune con le stelle si trasformeranno e in base la loro numero potranno segnare il Major jackpot (puntata totale moltiplicata per 500), il Minor jackpot (puntata totale moltiplicata per 100) oppure il Mini jackpot (puntata totale moltiplicata per 20).\n",

In each subsequent spin, a cash prize or a moon with a jackpot star appears. If at the end of the respins the reels are entirely covered in moons, we will win the Grand Jackpot, that is, the total bet multiplied by 2,000. Otherwise, the moons with the stars will transform, and depending on their quantity, can mark the Major jackpot (total bet multiplied by 500), the Minor jackpot (total bet multiplied by 100), or the Mini jackpot (total bet multiplied by 20).\n        ",

This game, developed through the partnership of Rarestone Gaming and Playtech, draws inspiration from the classic tale of \"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp\".\n\nThe story is well-known, but for those who may not remember it, let us refresh it briefly. Aladdin is a young man without work who is forced by a magician to go underground to retrieve an oil lamp. After becoming trapped, Aladdin manages to escape thanks to the help of the genie in the lamp. Upon returning to his city, he falls in love with the emperor's daughter, whose name means \"Full Moon of the Full Moons\".\n\nAnd the moon is indeed one of the most important symbols in the game. Before discussing the gameplay, let us first talk about the graphics. Given the setting of the slot, the colors naturally tend towards the orange of the desert present in the background. The symbols are rich with detail and animate in response to wins or bonuses, while an oriental-inspired soundtrack accompanies us throughout the game. Below the reels, we find all the information on the bet and buttons to better adjust the settings.\n\nGame Features\n\nThe game grid has a traditional structure with 5 reels and 3 rows. The 50 paylines are fixed, with a minimum bet of €0.25 per spin up to a maximum of €500. Between 5 and 100 automatic spins can be activated, which can be deactivated at any time. Jinns Moon boasts an excellent RTP of 96.58% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nMultiple bonuses and 3 level Jackpots are present in this slot. Let us first examine the symbols and how much we can win thanks to them. The playing cards from 10 to Ace are naturally the ones that pay out the least, followed by the scimitar, magic carpet, and pot overflowing with gold. The monkey is the highest-valued symbol. The princess is our Wild, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, and can only appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 during regular gameplay. If we see the princess appear on all 5 slots, we are entitled to a 75x multiplier. The Scatter is the magic lamp, and if it appears at least 3 times, we will receive 8 free spins along with a sum of money. The full moon is our Bonus symbol, can appear on all reels, and guarantees a multiplier ranging from 1x to 50x, as well as bringing the Fire Blaze Jackpot to life. In this case, 3 free spins are awarded during which the bonus symbols that activated the function remain locked on the reels. In each subsequent spin, a cash prize or a moon with a jackpot star appears. If at the end of the respins the reels are entirely covered in moons, we will win the Grand Jackpot, that is, the total bet multiplied by 2,000. Otherwise, the moons with the stars will transform, and depending on their quantity, can mark the Major jackpot (total bet multiplied by 500), the Minor jackpot (total bet multiplied by 100), or the Mini jackpot (total bet multiplied by 20).\n            ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay and Features\nSymbols and Paylines\nJackpots\nGraphics and Sound\nRTP and Volatility\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Jinns Moon\n\nTake a ride on the magic carpet with the gorgeous Jasmine and friendly Abu in Jinns Moon - a slot game that transports you to the fantastical world of the \"Arabian Nights\"! This game, developed through the partnership of Rarestone Gaming and Playtech, draws inspiration from the classic tale of \"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp\".\n\nThe story is well-known, but for those who may not remember it, let us refresh it briefly. Aladdin is a young man without work who is forced by a magician to go underground to retrieve an oil lamp. After becoming trapped, Aladdin manages to escape thanks to the help of the genie in the lamp. Upon returning to his city, he falls in love with the emperor's daughter, whose name means \"Full Moon of the Full Moons\".\n\nAnd the moon is indeed one of the most important symbols in the game. Before discussing the gameplay, let us first talk about the graphics. Given the setting of the slot, the colors naturally tend towards the orange of the desert present in the background. The symbols are rich with detail and animate in response to wins or bonuses, while an oriental-inspired soundtrack accompanies us throughout the game. Below the reels, we find all the information on the bet and buttons to better adjust the settings.\n\nGame Features\n\nThe game grid has a traditional structure with 5 reels and 3 rows. The 50 paylines are fixed, with a minimum bet of €0.25 per spin up to a maximum of €500. Between 5 and 100 automatic spins can be activated, which can be deactivated at any time. Jinns Moon boasts an excellent RTP of 96.58% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nMultiple bonuses and 3 level Jackpots are present in this slot. Let us first examine the symbols and how much we can win thanks to them. The playing cards from 10 to Ace are naturally the ones that pay out the least, followed by the scimitar, magic carpet, and pot overflowing with gold. The monkey is the highest-valued symbol. The princess is our Wild, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, and can only appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 during regular gameplay. If we see the princess appear on all 5 slots, we are entitled to a 75x multiplier. The Scatter is the magic lamp, and if it appears at least 3 times, we will receive 8 free spins along with a sum of money. The full moon is our Bonus symbol, can appear on all reels, and guarantees a multiplier ranging from 1x to 50x, as well as bringing the Fire Blaze Jackpot to life. In this case, 3 free spins are awarded during which the bonus symbols that activated the function remain locked on the reels. In each subsequent spin, a cash prize or a moon with a jackpot star appears. If at the end of the respins the reels are entirely covered in moons, we will win the Grand Jackpot, that is, the total bet multiplied by 2,000. Otherwise, the moons with the stars will transform, and depending on their quantity, can mark the Major jackpot (total bet multiplied by 500), the Minor jackpot (total bet multiplied by 100), or the Mini jackpot (total bet multiplied by 20).\n            ",

The game includes playing cards from 10 to Ace, a scimitar, magic carpet, pot overflowing with gold, monkey, princess Wild, scatter magic lamp, and bonus symbol full moon. The princess can only appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 during regular gameplay with a 75x multiplier when she appears on all 5 slots. The scatter magic lamp awards 8 free spins and a sum of money when appearing at least three times. The full moon is the bonus symbol and can appear on all reels, which guarantees a multiplier ranging from 1x to 50x and activates the Fire Blaze Jackpot that comes to life in three free spins. In each spin, a cash prize or a moon with a jackpot star appears. If the reels are entirely covered in moons, we will win the Grand Jackpot, which is the total bet multiplied by 2,000. Otherwise, we may win the Major jackpot, the Minor jackpot, or the Mini jackpot that range from a total bet multiplied by 500 to 20, respectively.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nJinns Moon has an excellent RTP of 96.58%, which is significantly above average in the gaming industry. The slot also features high to very high volatility, so players can expect fewer payouts, but the payouts can be significant when they do occur.\n\nJackpots and Bonus Rounds\n\nJinns Moon offers three types of progressive jackpots: Grand, Major, and Minor. The Grand jackpot is the highest and can be won by covering the entire game reels with moons with stars. The game also has a Fire Blaze Jackpot where the Bonus symbol can trigger respins, and players have the chance to win one of the four jackpots. The slot also includes a scatter symbol that awards players with eight free spins when appearing three times or more.\n\nBetting Range\n\nJinns Moon has a betting range that suits both low and high rollers. The minimum bet is €0.25, while the maximum bet is €500. Players can also activate automatic spins ranging from 5 to 100.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nJinns Moon captures the magic of Arabian Nights with its rich graphics and oriental-inspired soundtrack. The color scheme features the orange of desert with detailed symbols that animate in response to wins or bonuses. The game grid is set against a backdrop of the mystical lamp, reminding players of the Aladdin tale. The soundtrack creates a serene and magical mood and blends well with the game theme.\n\n        \n            ",

It has an excellent RTP of 96.58% and high volatility. Players can place bets ranging from €0.25 to €500 per spin and activate between 5 and 100 automatic spins. The game features several bonuses and 3 level Jackpots.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nThe game symbols include playing cards from 10 to Ace, a scimitar, a magic carpet, a pot overflowing with gold, a monkey, a princess (Wild), a magic lamp (Scatter), and a full moon (Bonus). The princess can replace all symbols except the Scatter, and the Scatter can trigger 8 free spins and a cash prize.

The jackpots include the Grand Jackpot (total bet multiplied by 2,000), Major jackpot (total bet multiplied by 500), Minor jackpot (total bet multiplied by 100), and Mini jackpot (total bet multiplied by 20).\n\nJackpots\n\nJinns Moon has three level Jackpots: Grand, Major, Minor, and Mini. The Grand Jackpot offers the highest payout, which is the total bet multiplied by 2,000.

The animations are smooth and responsive, enhancing the overall gaming experience.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nJinns Moon has an excellent RTP of 96.58%, which means the game is likely to return €96.58 for every €100 wagered. The high volatility of the game means that winning combinations may not appear frequently, but when they do, they offer larger payouts. Players should expect to place more bets before seeing significant returns.\n\n        \n            ",

This game, developed through the partnership of Rarestone Gaming and Playtech, draws inspiration from the classic tale of \"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp\".\n\nThe story is well-known, but for those who may not remember it, let us refresh it briefly. Aladdin is a young man without work who is forced by a magician to go underground to retrieve an oil lamp. After becoming trapped, Aladdin manages to escape thanks to the help of the genie in the lamp. Upon returning to his city, he falls in love with the emperor's daughter, whose name means \"Full Moon of the Full Moons\".\n\nAnd the moon is indeed one of the most important symbols in the game. Before discussing the gameplay, let us first talk about the graphics. Given the setting of the slot, the colors naturally tend towards the orange of the desert present in the background. The symbols are rich with detail and animate in response to wins or bonuses, while an oriental-inspired soundtrack accompanies us throughout the game. Below the reels, we find all the information on the bet and buttons to better adjust the settings.\n\nGame Features\n\nThe game grid has a traditional structure with 5 reels and 3 rows. The 50 paylines are fixed, with a minimum bet of €0.25 per spin up to a maximum of €500. Between 5 and 100 automatic spins can be activated, which can be deactivated at any time. Jinns Moon boasts an excellent RTP of 96.58% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nMultiple bonuses and 3 level Jackpots are present in this slot. Let us first examine the symbols and how much we can win thanks to them. The playing cards from 10 to Ace are naturally the ones that pay out the least, followed by the scimitar, magic carpet, and pot overflowing with gold. The monkey is the highest-valued symbol. The princess is our Wild, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, and can only appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 during regular gameplay. If we see the princess appear on all 5 slots, we are entitled to a 75x multiplier. The Scatter is the magic lamp, and if it appears at least 3 times, we will receive 8 free spins along with a sum of money. The full moon is our Bonus symbol, can appear on all reels, and guarantees a multiplier ranging from 1x to 50x, as well as bringing the Fire Blaze Jackpot to life. In this case, 3 free spins are awarded during which the bonus symbols that activated the function remain locked on the reels. In each subsequent spin, a cash prize or a moon with a jackpot star appears. If at the end of the respins the reels are entirely covered in moons, we will win the Grand Jackpot, that is, the total bet multiplied by 2,000. Otherwise, the moons with the stars will transform, and depending on their quantity, can mark the Major jackpot (total bet multiplied by 500), the Minor jackpot (total bet multiplied by 100), or the Mini jackpot (total bet multiplied by 20).\n            ",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a review of the game \"Jinns Moon\".\n\nPlease provide an FAQ:\n\n- 8 questions\n- Use simple language and provide practical takeaways.\n- Respond with a JSON!\n- Use the key \"faq\" and an array with the keys \"question\" and \"answer\". \n\nReview: Jinns Moon\n\nTake a ride on the magic carpet with the gorgeous Jasmine and friendly Abu in Jinns Moon - a slot game that transports you to the fantastical world of the \"Arabian Nights\"! This game, developed through the partnership of Rarestone Gaming and Playtech, draws inspiration from the classic tale of \"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp\".\n\nThe story is well-known, but for those who may not remember it, let us refresh it briefly. Aladdin is a young man without work who is forced by a magician to go underground to retrieve an oil lamp. After becoming trapped, Aladdin manages to escape thanks to the help of the genie in the lamp. Upon returning to his city, he falls in love with the emperor's daughter, whose name means \"Full Moon of the Full Moons\".\n\nAnd the moon is indeed one of the most important symbols in the game. Before discussing the gameplay, let us first talk about the graphics. Given the setting of the slot, the colors naturally tend towards the orange of the desert present in the background. The symbols are rich with detail and animate in response to wins or bonuses, while an oriental-inspired soundtrack accompanies us throughout the game. Below the reels, we find all the information on the bet and buttons to better adjust the settings.\n\nGame Features\n\nThe game grid has a traditional structure with 5 reels and 3 rows. The 50 paylines are fixed, with a minimum bet of €0.25 per spin up to a maximum of €500. Between 5 and 100 automatic spins can be activated, which can be deactivated at any time. Jinns Moon boasts an excellent RTP of 96.58% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nMultiple bonuses and 3 level Jackpots are present in this slot. Let us first examine the symbols and how much we can win thanks to them. The playing cards from 10 to Ace are naturally the ones that pay out the least, followed by the scimitar, magic carpet, and pot overflowing with gold. The monkey is the highest-valued symbol. The princess is our Wild, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, and can only appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 during regular gameplay. If we see the princess appear on all 5 slots, we are entitled to a 75x multiplier. The Scatter is the magic lamp, and if it appears at least 3 times, we will receive 8 free spins along with a sum of money. The full moon is our Bonus symbol, can appear on all reels, and guarantees a multiplier ranging from 1x to 50x, as well as bringing the Fire Blaze Jackpot to life. In this case, 3 free spins are awarded during which the bonus symbols that activated the function remain locked on the reels. In each subsequent spin, a cash prize or a moon with a jackpot star appears. If at the end of the respins the reels are entirely covered in moons, we will win the Grand Jackpot, that is, the total bet multiplied by 2,000. Otherwise, the moons with the stars will transform, and depending on their quantity, can mark the Major jackpot (total bet multiplied by 500), the Minor jackpot (total bet multiplied by 100), or the Mini jackpot (total bet multiplied by 20).\n            ",
