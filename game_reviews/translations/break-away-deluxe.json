    "original_text": "\nBreak Away Deluxe\nBreak Away, e la sua tematica, è un tema particolarmente caro alla casa di sviluppo Microgaming. Dopo aver portato su tutti i computer la prima slot incentrata sull’hockey su ghiaccio, con Break Away Deluxe hanno voluto proporre una variante non nello stile ma nelle meccaniche di gioco.\nIl tutto non solo per proporre qualcosa di diverso ma rispettando il gusto dei loro giocatori, ma seguendo l’evoluzione tecnologica che ci porta sempre più a utilizzare smartphone al posto di computer.\nVediamo insieme questa slot.\nBreak Away Deluxe: tema e stile della slot\nCome abbiamo avuto modo di anticipare nell’introduzione a questa recensione, Break Away concentra la propria tematica attorno al mondo dell’hockey su ghiaccio. Tra i simboli che vanno ad affollare la ricca griglia di gioco, infatti, troviamo il campo da gioco su cui si svolgono gli incontri così come i vari giocatori che pattinano sulla pista, l’arbitro che presiede l’incontro e addirittura dettagli come i pattini stessi e il macchinario necessario per la gestione del ghiaccio.\nLo stesso contorno della griglia di gioco richiama naturalmente al colore del ghiaccio e ci permette di calarci nella giusta ambientazione per goderci questa slot, le cui vere novità si trovano nelle meccaniche di gioco.\nBreak Away Delux: 25 simboli alla volta\nAnche il più profano del mondo delle slot machine può notare sin da subito che la struttura della griglia di gioco è diversa rispetto al solito. Infatti parliamo di un meccanismo 5*5 rispetto al classico 5*3. Qual è la differenza in breve?\nIn un meccanismo 5×3 troviamo cinque rulli o linee verticali che vanno a intersecarsi con tre linee orizzontali. In ogni punto in cui queste linee si vanno a toccare troviamo un simbolo, ovvero quindici simboli a giocata. Le stesse linee di gioco sono limitate dal numero di simboli, e solitamente si aggirano attorno ai 20/25.\nIn Break Away Delux della Microgaming, invece, proprio grazie ai 25 simboli che vengono mostrati in ogni giocata, è possibile avere un numero di linee di vincita (linee lungo le quali si possono disporre le varie combinazioni) maggiore. A scelta del giocatore, queste possono essere 18, 38, 68 o 88 e lo scegliere una piuttosto che un’altra cambia sensibilmente l’esperienza di gioco.\nOltre a questo, ci sono due funzioni interessanti da tenere a mente durante il gioco: il primo è quello dei simboli in caduta, una meccanica che può essere trovata anche in altre slot della Microgaming. Grazie a questa funzione, ogni volta che otterremo una combinazione vincente, i simboli in questione spariranno e altri ne cadranno dall’altro. In questo modo è possibile ottenere delle vincite concatenate che aumenteranno a dismisura il valore della nostra giocata.\nLa seconda funzione è quella dello Smashing Wild. Questa funzione appare causalmente durante la partita e trasforma le tre linee centrali in simboli Wild (ovvero jolly) che non solo garantiranno una vincita, ma il valore della stessa sarà molto alto!\nSlot simili a Break Away Deluxe\nÈ lecito presupporre che chiunque abbia apprezzato questa slot, apprezzerà altri titoli che fanno dello sport il tema protagonista come Fisticuffs della NetEnt, un gioco di ottimo gusto sulla boxe o Football Frenzy della RTG che invece, come si può intuire dal titolo, gira attorno allo sport del calcio. Entrambe sono slot molto apprezzate nel settore.\n",

After bringing the first ice hockey slot to all computers, with Break Away Deluxe they wanted to propose a variant not in style but in game mechanics. All this not only to offer something different but also to respect the taste of their players, following the technological evolution that leads us to use smartphones instead of computers. Let's take a look at this slot together.\nBreak Away Deluxe: theme and style of the slot\nAs we had the opportunity to anticipate in the introduction to this review, Break Away focuses its theme around the world of ice hockey. Among the symbols that crowd the rich game grid, we find the field on which the matches take place as well as the various players skating on the ice, the referee presiding over the match and even details such as the skates themselves and the machinery necessary for ice management. The same border of the game grid naturally recalls the color of the ice and allows us to immerse ourselves in the right atmosphere to enjoy this slot, whose real innovations are found in the game mechanics.\nBreak Away Delux: 25 symbols at a time\nEven the most profane of the world of slot machines can immediately notice that the structure of the game grid is different from the usual. In fact, we are talking about a 5*5 mechanism compared to the classic 5*3. What is the difference in short? In a 5x3 mechanism we find five reels or vertical lines that intersect with three horizontal lines. At every point where these lines touch, we find a symbol, that is fifteen symbols per spin. The same game lines are limited by the number of symbols, and usually hover around 20/25. In Microgaming's Break Away Delux, however, thanks to the 25 symbols shown in each spin, it is possible to have a greater number of winning lines (lines along which the various combinations can be arranged). At the player's choice, these can be 18, 38, 68 or 88, and choosing one rather than another changes the gaming experience significantly. In addition to this, there are two interesting functions to keep in mind during the game: the first is that of falling symbols, a mechanic that can also be found in other Microgaming slots. Thanks to this function, every time we get a winning combination, the symbols in question will disappear and others will fall from above. In this way, it is possible to obtain concatenated wins that will greatly increase the value of our play. The second function is that of the Smashing Wild. This function appears randomly during the game and transforms the three central lines into Wild symbols (i.e. jokers) that not only guarantee a win, but the value of the win will be very high!\nSlots similar to Break Away Deluxe\nIt is reasonable to assume that anyone who appreciated this slot will appreciate other titles that make sport the protagonist theme such as Fisticuffs by NetEnt, an excellent game about boxing, or Football Frenzy by RTG which instead, as can be guessed from the title, revolves around the sport of soccer. Both are highly appreciated slots in the industry.\n            ",

The game grid has a 5x5 mechanism that allows for 25 symbols at a time, creating more opportunities for winning lines. Players can choose between 18, 38, 68, or 88 winning lines, a choice that can significantly change the gaming experience. The game also offers two exciting functions, falling symbols and Smashing Wild, that increase the value of the play.\n\nUnique grid structure\n\nThe game grid structure in Break Away Deluxe is unlike usual slot games. The grid has a 5x5 mechanism that allows for 25 symbols in each spin. This unique structure enables a greater number of game lines and opportunities for winning combinations. It adds a fresh spin compared to the classic 5x3 mechanism.\n\nWinning lines\n\nBreak Away Deluxe offers players more opportunities to win through its numerous winning lines. Players can choose from four options: 18, 38, 68, or 88. Each option significantly changes the gaming experience and the chance to win. This customization adds an extra layer of excitement when playing Break Away Deluxe.\n\nFalling symbols\n\nBreak Away Deluxe has a falling symbols function that will be appreciated by players. Thanks to this feature, players get more chances to win as the symbols in a winning combination disappear and others fall from above. It creates the possibility of getting concatenated wins that increases the value of the play. This mechanic is present in other Microgaming slots, but the frequency in which it appears adds a level of excitement to Break Away Deluxe.\n\nSmashing Wild function\n\nBreak Away Deluxe has a Smashing Wild function that appears randomly during gameplay. The function turns the central three lines into Wild symbols that guarantee a win. The value of the win when this function is activated is exceptionally high, making it a highly valued feature of the game. This function adds another layer of excitement and opportunity for players to win.\n\n        \n            ",

After bringing the first ice hockey slot to all computers, with Break Away Deluxe they wanted to propose a variant not in style but in game mechanics. All this not only to offer something different but also to respect the taste of their players, following the technological evolution that leads us to use smartphones instead of computers. Let's take a look at this slot together.\nBreak Away Deluxe: theme and style of the slot\nAs we had the opportunity to anticipate in the introduction to this review, Break Away focuses its theme around the world of ice hockey. Among the symbols that crowd the rich game grid, we find the field on which the matches take place as well as the various players skating on the ice, the referee presiding over the match and even details such as the skates themselves and the machinery necessary for ice management. The same border of the game grid naturally recalls the color of the ice and allows us to immerse ourselves in the right atmosphere to enjoy this slot, whose real innovations are found in the game mechanics.\nBreak Away Delux: 25 symbols at a time\nEven the most profane of the world of slot machines can immediately notice that the structure of the game grid is different from the usual. In fact, we are talking about a 5*5 mechanism compared to the classic 5*3. What is the difference in short? In a 5x3 mechanism we find five reels or vertical lines that intersect with three horizontal lines. At every point where these lines touch, we find a symbol, that is fifteen symbols per spin. The same game lines are limited by the number of symbols, and usually hover around 20/25. In Microgaming's Break Away Delux, however, thanks to the 25 symbols shown in each spin, it is possible to have a greater number of winning lines (lines along which the various combinations can be arranged). At the player's choice, these can be 18, 38, 68 or 88, and choosing one rather than another changes the gaming experience significantly. In addition to this, there are two interesting functions to keep in mind during the game: the first is that of falling symbols, a mechanic that can also be found in other Microgaming slots. Thanks to this function, every time we get a winning combination, the symbols in question will disappear and others will fall from above. In this way, it is possible to obtain concatenated wins that will greatly increase the value of our play. The second function is that of the Smashing Wild. This function appears randomly during the game and transforms the three central lines into Wild symbols (i.e. jokers) that not only guarantee a win, but the value of the win will be very high!\nSlots similar to Break Away Deluxe\nIt is reasonable to assume that anyone who appreciated this slot will appreciate other titles that make sport the protagonist theme such as Fisticuffs by NetEnt, an excellent game about boxing, or Football Frenzy by RTG which instead, as can be guessed from the title, revolves around the sport of soccer. Both are highly appreciated slots in the industry.\n            ",

The same border of the game grid naturally recalls the color of the ice and allows us to immerse ourselves in the right atmosphere to enjoy this slot, whose real innovations are found in the game mechanics.\nBreak Away Delux: 25 symbols at a time\nEven the most profane of the world of slot machines can immediately notice that the structure of the game grid is different from the usual. In fact, we are talking about a 5*5 mechanism compared to the classic 5*3. What is the difference in short? In a 5x3 mechanism we find five reels or vertical lines that intersect with three horizontal lines. At every point where these lines touch, we find a symbol, that is fifteen symbols per spin. The same game lines are limited by the number of symbols, and usually hover around 20/25. In Microgaming's Break Away Delux, however, thanks to the 25 symbols shown in each spin, it is possible to have a greater number of winning lines (lines along which the various combinations can be arranged). At the player's choice, these can be 18, 38, 68 or 88, and choosing one rather than another changes the gaming experience significantly. In addition to this, there are two interesting functions to keep in mind during the game: the first is that of falling symbols, a mechanic that can also be found in other Microgaming slots. Thanks to this function, every time we get a winning combination, the symbols in question will disappear and others will fall from above. In this way, it is possible to obtain concatenated wins that will greatly increase the value of our play. The second function is that of the Smashing Wild. This function appears randomly during the game and transforms the three central lines into Wild symbols (i.e. jokers) that not only guarantee a win, but the value of the win will be very high!\nSlots similar to Break Away Deluxe\nIt is reasonable to assume that anyone who appreciated this slot will appreciate other titles that make sport the protagonist theme such as Fisticuffs by NetEnt, an excellent game about boxing, or Football Frenzy by RTG which instead, as can be guessed from the title, revolves around the sport of soccer. Both are highly appreciated slots in the industry.\n            ",

After bringing the first ice hockey slot to all computers, with Break Away Deluxe they wanted to propose a variant not in style but in game mechanics. All this not only to offer something different but also to respect the taste of their players, following the technological evolution that leads us to use smartphones instead of computers. Let's take a look at this slot together.\nBreak Away Deluxe: theme and style of the slot\nAs we had the opportunity to anticipate in the introduction to this review, Break Away focuses its theme around the world of ice hockey.
