The return to player (RTP) of Greek Gods is more than respectable at 96.5%, while in terms of volatility, Pragmatic Play assigns this slot a score of 4/5, in other words medium-high, with the possibility of obtaining rather substantial cash wins. \nOne particular feature worth mentioning in Greek Gods is the Autoplay function, available in both Quick Spin and Turbo Spin mode for lightning fast gameplay! \nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters\nAmong all the symbols, those representing the two deities have the highest value: Zeus offers a maximum payout of 6 times the bet when it appears on all five reels.

In this new slot, Pragmatic Play decided to exploit this theme once again, which is already quite familiar to experienced players. In fact, although the theme is that of Greek deities, in this slot machine there are only two: Zeus, king of the Olympians, and his wife Hera. \nAn ordinary theme therefore, but with very attractive graphics and game screen style: a modern and bright background, enriched with golden clouds, frames the reels; the symbols are reproduced very accurately and as a whole, Greek Gods presents itself from a visual point of view as a really well-made game.\nGameplay \nTo spin the reels, bets can be chosen ranging from a minimum of €0.25 up to a maximum of €125 per spin, setting the value of each token and how many to bet on each of the 253 pay lines. The return to player (RTP) of Greek Gods is more than respectable at 96.5%, while in terms of volatility, Pragmatic Play assigns this slot a score of 4/5, in other words medium-high, with the possibility of obtaining rather substantial cash wins. \nOne particular feature worth mentioning in Greek Gods is the Autoplay function, available in both Quick Spin and Turbo Spin mode for lightning fast gameplay! \nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters\nAmong all the symbols, those representing the two deities have the highest value: Zeus offers a maximum payout of 6 times the bet when it appears on all five reels. Next, Hera and the other theme-related symbols i.e. a harp and a chalice follow. As usual, we have numbers and letters referring to playing cards, this time from 10 to Ace.  \nThere is a Scatter symbol that is the lightning bolt, which not only allows access to the special Random Awards feature, but also awards free spins when five of these symbols are present on the reels. Thanks to the possibility of having stacked Scatter symbols and the Random Awards feature, up to 40 free spins can be obtained.\nSimilar Slots to Greek Gods\nAs we said, this theme is present in several games of the major providers and in the best online casinos we can find different slots that resemble Greek Gods. We recommend Zeus the Thunder from MrSlotty for its truly spectacular graphics, engaging from the very first screen, and The Legend of Olympus from Rabcat Gambling for its particularly rich gameplay.

In this new slot, Pragmatic Play decided to exploit this theme once again, which is already quite familiar to experienced players. In fact, although the theme is that of Greek deities, in this slot machine there are only two: Zeus, king of the Olympians, and his wife Hera. \nAn ordinary theme therefore, but with very attractive graphics and game screen style: a modern and bright background, enriched with golden clouds, frames the reels; the symbols are reproduced very accurately and as a whole, Greek Gods presents itself from a visual point of view as a really well-made game.\nGameplay \nTo spin the reels, bets can be chosen ranging from a minimum of €0.25 up to a maximum of €125 per spin, setting the value of each token and how many to bet on each of the 253 pay lines. The return to player (RTP) of Greek Gods is more than respectable at 96.5%, while in terms of volatility, Pragmatic Play assigns this slot a score of 4/5, in other words medium-high, with the possibility of obtaining rather substantial cash wins. \nOne particular feature worth mentioning in Greek Gods is the Autoplay function, available in both Quick Spin and Turbo Spin mode for lightning fast gameplay! \nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters\nAmong all the symbols, those representing the two deities have the highest value: Zeus offers a maximum payout of 6 times the bet when it appears on all five reels. Next, Hera and the other theme-related symbols i.e. a harp and a chalice follow. As usual, we have numbers and letters referring to playing cards, this time from 10 to Ace.  \nThere is a Scatter symbol that is the lightning bolt, which not only allows access to the special Random Awards feature, but also awards free spins when five of these symbols are present on the reels. Thanks to the possibility of having stacked Scatter symbols and the Random Awards feature, up to 40 free spins can be obtained.\nSimilar Slots to Greek Gods\nAs we said, this theme is present in several games of the major providers and in the best online casinos we can find different slots that resemble Greek Gods. We recommend Zeus the Thunder from MrSlotty for its truly spectacular graphics, engaging from the very first screen, and The Legend of Olympus from Rabcat Gambling for its particularly rich gameplay. As for the most famous providers, we have Medusa and Titan Storm from NextGen, Titans of the Sun Hyperion from Microgaming, and Odysseus from Playson.\n        ",
