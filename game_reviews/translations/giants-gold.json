The first one has five reels and four horizontal lines, showing twenty symbols per spin. The second screen, called the colossal grid, features five reels and twelve horizontal lines with sixty symbols per spin. The game also features special symbols such as the magic bean plant, which replaces any other symbol, and the golden egg, which triggers the free spins function, with the possibility of obtaining a high number of free spins.\n\nGraphics and sound design\n\nThe game features high-quality graphics and sound design. The symbols within the game grid are not super detailed but refer to the story of the magic beans, including the plant, grass, the cow given in exchange for the seeds, and the giant himself. The sounds accompanying the game is realistic and immersive, including chickens, cows, birds, and other sounds typical of the countryside.\n\nSpecial symbols and features\n\nGiant's Gold features special symbols such as the magic bean plant, which is a Wild symbol capable of replacing any other symbol within the game. It also has a golden egg, which allows access to the free spins function, with the possibility of obtaining a high number of them given the various reels where the eggs can be found. During this mode, a multiplier on the winnings obtained in the colossal grid is observed, equal to twice their value.\n\nTarget audience\n\nGiant's Gold is recommended for everyone, including those who are approaching slots for the first time and for veterans who are tired of the classic 5x3 mechanism offered in most online slots. However, it may take some time to acclimate to its unique gameplay mechanics.\n\nSimilar games\n\nGiven the uniqueness of the gameplay mechanism of this slot, it's difficult to find titles that are similar. From a technical point of view, we can only recommend the aforementioned Fire Queen from the same WMS. If we're looking for a game that shares the theme of Jack and the Beanstalk, then we can recommend Lucky Beans from IGT and Enchanted Beans from Amaya.\n\n        \n            ",

Fire Queen (another slot we have reviewed) and Giant's Gold are examples of this.\n\nLet's dive into why these slots differ from the norm with our analysis.\n\nGiant's Gold: visual aspects\n\nThe new features of this title mostly concern the technical aspects of the gameplay, but it's worth mentioning the graphics and sound as well to get an idea of the game we'll be facing. Sound-wise, the music is triggered only after a win, which means that most of the time we'll be accompanied by the sounds of the countryside, including chickens, cows, various birds, and other sounds typical of this setting.\n\nReviewer's note: having grown up in the countryside, I was amazed to discover how realistic the sound is, which really gives the impression of being in the middle of fields.\n\nThe various symbols found inside the game grid aren't super detailed and naturally refer to the story of the magic beans, including the plant, grass, the cow given in exchange for the seeds, and the giant himself.\n\nNow let's move on to the most interesting aspect of this slot.\n\nGiant's Gold: gameplay mechanics\n\nThis slot is definitely unique: on the game screen, we're faced with two grids. The normal one consists of five reels and four horizontal lines, showing twenty symbols at each spin. Next to it is the colossal grid, which has five reels and twelve horizontal lines, showing a number of symbols at each spin equal to sixty!\n\nThere are also special symbols, such as the magic bean plant, which is a Wild symbol capable of replacing any other symbol within the game.\n\nSpeaking of special functions, the golden egg allows access to the free spins function, with the possibility of obtaining a high number of them given the various reels where the eggs can be found. During this mode, a multiplier on the winnings obtained in the colossal grid is observed, equal to twice their value. The music accompanying this mode is also noteworthy, very different from the animal sounds we've heard so far.\n\nThis slot is recommended for everyone, both those who are approaching slots for the first time (although it may take a bit of time to acclimate) and for veterans who are tired of the classic 5x3 mechanism offered in 90% of online slots.\n\nSlots similar to Giant's Gold\n\nGiven the uniqueness of the gameplay mechanism of this slot, it's difficult to find titles that are similar. From a technical point of view, we can only recommend the aforementioned Fire Queen from the same WMS, while if we're looking for a game that shares the theme of Jack and the Beanstalk, then we can recommend Lucky Beans from IGT and Enchanted Beans from Amaya.\n            ",

Fire Queen (another slot we have reviewed) and Giant's Gold are examples of this.\n\nLet's dive into why these slots differ from the norm with our analysis.\n\nGiant's Gold: visual aspects\n\nThe new features of this title mostly concern the technical aspects of the gameplay, but it's worth mentioning the graphics and sound as well to get an idea of the game we'll be facing. Sound-wise, the music is triggered only after a win, which means that most of the time we'll be accompanied by the sounds of the countryside, including chickens, cows, various birds, and other sounds typical of this setting.\n\nReviewer's note: having grown up in the countryside, I was amazed to discover how realistic the sound is, which really gives the impression of being in the middle of fields.\n\nThe various symbols found inside the game grid aren't super detailed and naturally refer to the story of the magic beans, including the plant, grass, the cow given in exchange for the seeds, and the giant himself.\n\nNow let's move on to the most interesting aspect of this slot.\n\nGiant's Gold: gameplay mechanics\n\nThis slot is definitely unique: on the game screen, we're faced with two grids. The normal one consists of five reels and four horizontal lines, showing twenty symbols at each spin. Next to it is the colossal grid, which has five reels and twelve horizontal lines, showing a number of symbols at each spin equal to sixty!\n\nThere are also special symbols, such as the magic bean plant, which is a Wild symbol capable of replacing any other symbol within the game.\n\nSpeaking of special functions, the golden egg allows access to the free spins function, with the possibility of obtaining a high number of them given the various reels where the eggs can be found. During this mode, a multiplier on the winnings obtained in the colossal grid is observed, equal to twice their value. The music accompanying this mode is also noteworthy, very different from the animal sounds we've heard so far.\n\nThis slot is recommended for everyone, both those who are approaching slots for the first time (although it may take a bit of time to acclimate) and for veterans who are tired of the classic 5x3 mechanism offered in 90% of online slots.\n\nSlots similar to Giant's Gold\n\nGiven the uniqueness of the gameplay mechanism of this slot, it's difficult to find titles that are similar. From a technical point of view, we can only recommend the aforementioned Fire Queen from the same WMS, while if we're looking for a game that shares the theme of Jack and the Beanstalk, then we can recommend Lucky Beans from IGT and Enchanted Beans from Amaya.\n        ",
