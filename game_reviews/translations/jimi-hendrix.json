Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame Theme and Design\n\nJimi Hendrix is a slot game that captures the spirit of the 60s and the sense of freedom and revolution that animated the hearts of millions of young Americans. The game is set against a desert backdrop that immediately brings to mind Woodstock, while the game grid resembles the body of a Fender Stratocaster. Thematic symbols harken back to the era of peace and love, such as flowers, the peace symbol, and vinyl records. The iconic guitar style of Jimi Hendrix and a mix of his hits make up the soundtrack.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nJimi Hendrix is a classic style slot game with 5 reels and 3 rows, on which 20 fixed pay lines are arranged. By adjusting the bet levels and coin costs, you can create personalized bets. With the lowest level and a fixed coin cost, a single spin costs only €0.20. The Max Bet button allows you to set level 10 with just one click, and the Autoplay button allows you to automatically start the game. The volatility is medium and the RTP value is 96.9%. There are different types of symbols: low, medium, high level, and special symbols. The Wild symbol is Jimi Hendrix's face, which replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The game features two special features called Purple Haze - which turns low-level symbols into Wild symbols, and Re-Spin Red Guitar - which offers a free spin.\n\nPay Lines and Reels\n\nJimi Hendrix has 5 reels and 20 fixed pay lines, with a classic grid layout of 3 rows. The game pays out on matching symbols from left to right on the pay lines, with the highest payout awarded for matching five Jimi Hendrix symbols. You can adjust the bet levels and coin costs to customize your bets, with single spins starting at €0.20 when you set the lowest level and a fixed coin cost.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThere are a total of six special features in Jimi Hendrix. The first two features are built into the base game: Purple Haze and Re-Spin Red Guitar. Purple Haze turns low-level symbols into Wild symbols, while Re-Spin Red Guitar offers a free spin. The remaining four features are triggered by landing 3 Jimi Hendrix Scatter symbols. These are Coin Win, Crosstown Traffic Free Spins, Purple Haze Free Spins, and Little Wing Free Spins. When you trigger these bonus features, you get to pick one of four possible outcomes at random, varying from up to 30x your bet in a simple coin win, to six to 12 free spins with walking Wild symbols that move on each turn.\n\nDevice Compatibility\n\nJimi Hendrix has been designed to work on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones and tablets. The game is powered by HTML5 technology, which means it adapts seamlessly to the screen size of the device without compromising on the quality of graphics or gameplay. Whether you're playing on a laptop or a touchscreen device, you'll enjoy the same smooth and immersive experience.\n\n        \n            ",

Set against a desert backdrop that immediately brings to mind Woodstock, the game grid vaguely resembles the body of a Fender Stratocaster, Jimi's favorite guitar. Thematic symbols harken back to the era of peace and love, such as flowers, the peace symbol, and vinyl records. The soundtrack is a mix of hits, beginning with the famous and iconic Voodoo Child.\n\nReel Grid and Pay Lines\n\nJimi Hendrix has a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, on which 20 fixed pay lines are arranged. By adjusting the bet levels and coin costs, players can create personalized bets. The volatility is medium and the RTP value is 96.9%. The minimum bet per spin is €0.20 and the maximum bet is €200.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nJimi Hendrix features various types of symbols, including low, medium, and high level symbols, as well as special symbols. The Wild symbol is Jimi's face, which replaces all symbols except the Scatter. There are two special features available in the game: Purple Haze, which turns low-level symbols into Wild symbols, and Re-Spin Red Guitar, which offers a free spin. \n\nBonus Features\n\nJimi Hendrix offers four bonus features, which are triggered by three Scatter symbols. The bonus features include Coins, Free Spins Crosstown Traffic, Free Spins Purple Haze, and Free Spins Little Wing. During the Coins feature, players win a random prize between 8x and 30x the bet. During the Free Spins Crosstown Traffic feature, players win six free spins with walking Wild symbols that move on each turn. During the Free Spins Purple Haze feature, players receive six to 12 free spins during which low-level symbols are transformed into Wild symbols. And during the Free Spins Little Wing feature, players gain six to 12 free spins with randomly overlapping Wild symbols on the reels.\n\nCompatibility with Devices\n\nJimi Hendrix is designed to work on all devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The game can be played on iOS and Android devices, as well as on Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems.\n\n        \n            ",

With his trusty Stratocaster by his side, he put on a memorable concert that would go down in live performance history. A year later, he would die in a London home after ingesting large amounts of alcohol and tranquilizers. \n\nWith his iconic guitar style, this slot game captures the spirit of the 60s and the sense of freedom and revolution that animated the hearts of millions of young Americans. Set against a desert backdrop that immediately brings to mind Woodstock, the game grid vaguely resembles the body of a Fender Stratocaster, Jimi's favorite guitar. Thematic symbols harken back to the era of peace and love, such as flowers, the peace symbol, and vinyl records. The soundtrack is a mix of hits, beginning with the famous and iconic Voodoo Child.\n\nA classic style slot game\nNetEnt has chosen a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, on which 20 fixed pay lines are arranged. By adjusting the bet levels and coin costs, you can create personalized bets. With the lowest level - level 1 and a fixed coin cost of 0.01 per pay line - a single spin costs only €0.20.\n\nThe Max Bet button allows you to set level 10 with just one click, and the Autoplay button allows you to automatically start the game. The volatility is medium and the RTP value is 96.9%.\n\nAll the magic of the 60s\nIn Jimi Hendrix, you'll find different types of symbols: low, medium, high level, and special symbols. From playing cards to the eye, the flower, the vinyl, the heart, and the peace symbol. To win higher payouts, however, you'll need to bet on the two Stratocasters and Jimi's face, which also serves as the Wild and replaces all symbols except the Scatter.\n\nThere are two special features:\n\n- Purple Haze, which turns low-level symbols into Wild symbols.\n- Re-Spin Red Guitar, which offers a free spin.\n\nThe Scatter is Jimi Hendrix holding the Fender. Three of these symbols trigger one of the available Bonus Pick and Click features:\n\n- Coins: a random win between 8x and 30x the bet.\n- Free Spins Crosstown Traffic: win six free spins with walking Wild symbols that move on each turn.\n- Free Spins Purple Haze: receive six to 12 free spins during which low-level symbols are transformed into Wild symbols.\n- Free Spins Little Wing: gain six to 12 free spins with randomly overlapping Wild symbols on the reels.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow many bonuses are in Jimi Hendrix?\n\nA total of six special features can be won.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nThe RTP value is 96.9%.\n\nCan I play Jimi Hendrix on my tablet?\n\nCertainly, this slot is designed to work on all devices.\n        ",
