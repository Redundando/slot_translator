Hey Sushi is a slot game that will make you swim in riches! With 5-reels, 3 rows, and 25 paylines that are always active, you'll have plenty of opportunities to win big. Plus, there's a wild symbol that's just as elusive as the perfect piece of toro - but it can substitute for any regular symbol, giving you even more ways to rake in the dough. </p><p>And let's talk about the cascading payout system, shall we? It's like having all the sushi you can eat - except instead of filling your belly, it fills your wallet. This game features a theoretical return to player of 96.71%, so it's definitely a high-variance game with some serious payout potential. </p><p>Don't let your budget stop you - the minimum bet is only €0.25, but if you're feeling daring (or hungry), you can go all-in with a maximum bet of €500 per spin. It's time to roll the dice and see if you have what it takes to become the best sushi chef in town!</p>\"\n}"
