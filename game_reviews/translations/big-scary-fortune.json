However, you can place bets from a minimum of 0.20 credits up to a maximum of 100.00 credits per spin.\n\nCompatibility with mobile devices\n\nBig Scary Fortune is developed based on HTML5 technology, which makes it available to play on any platform, including mobile devices like iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.

With ghosts and horror scenes awaiting you on the reels, this game offers not just fantastic gameplay, but also the potential for generous payouts and access to bonus games with free spins. In this review, you'll find all the details on this evocative slot game that was released in October 2022.\n\nBetting Options and Features of Big Scary Fortune:\nThe action starts on a 5x3 grid layout with 10 paylines where you can place your bets from a minimum of 0.20 credits up to a maximum of 100.00 credits per spin. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is around 94.80%, which is a bit lower compared to the average Halloween slot machines such as Habanero's Hot Hot Halloween or BGaming's Halloween Bonanza, but the wins in Big Scary Fortune have some amazing surprises in store for you!\n\nTheme and Symbols: The Perfect Night for a Scary Movie!\nSet on a semi-transparent grid with a creepy atmosphere on a dark and ghostly night, this new Inspired Gaming slot game will give you chills down your spine at the stroke of midnight.\nThe Scarecrow is the wild symbol, which appears on all reels only in the bonus game, while the Cauldron represents the Scatter. In the paytable, you'll find pumpkins, which can also form a mixed combination, ghosts, eyeballs, black cats, witch hats, and the classic low-value card symbols.\n\nSpecial Features Not to be Missed:\n\nBig Scary Fortune Bonus – Trigger this feature by landing 3, 4 or 5 Cauldrons anywhere on the screen. Before the start of the round, players participate in a sort of memory challenge where they must match 3 Big Pumpkins, revealing a value of up to x100.\nSpin Chance – A very generous feature designed by Inspired Gaming that allows you to get an extra spin if you don't have enough credits to reach the minimum bet.\n\nWhy Venture into the Horror Night of Big Scary Fortune:\nThis scary movie will please fans of spooky stories and unusual bonus rounds, as there are many in the game. For example, you can get free spins until you land a giant pumpkin and a scarecrow on the grid with sticky symbols. The only downside is the slightly below-average RTP.\n\nFAQ:\nCan I play the online slot game Big Scary Fortune on my mobile phone?\nAbsolutely. Mobile devices such as iOS, Android, and Windows Phone can offer you a new gaming experience. Big Scary Fortune is developed based on HTML5, and this allows you to play the slot on any platform.\n\nWhat is the Spin Chance feature for?\nThis extra feature allows you to spin the Big Scary Fortune slot even when your balance is less than the slot's minimum bet.\n\nIs Inspired Gaming a reliable software provider?\nCertainly. This provider has developed over 160 online slot machines, including Anubis Gold, Respin 7s, Totem Thunder, Big Wheel Bonus, and the iconic Big Egyptian Fortune. You can find the complete catalog on our portal.\n            ",
