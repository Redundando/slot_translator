Questo viaggio sull’isola misteriosa è stato creato da Iron Dog Studio e si gioca su una macchina a 5 rulli e 10 payline.  Il gameplay è relativamente semplice. Se un simbolo selvaggio di Excalibur atterra nella posizione più alta di qualsiasi bobina su una rotazione di gioco base, si espande per riempire quella bobina. L’atterraggio di 3, 4 o 5 corone scatters fa scattare la funzione Free Spins del gioco. Giocherete i giri liberi con uno speciale simbolo di espansione.

Per chi non è al passo con la storia di Artù, Avalon era un’isola magica dove è stata forgiata la spada di Re Artù Excalibur. Artù fu poi portato sull’isola per riprendersi dopo essere stato gravemente ferito nella battaglia di Camlann.\nAmbientata su uno sfondo verde e rustico, con la famosa spada nella pietra, la colonna sonora ha un aspetto tradizionale e magico, ma è anche piuttosto moderna.

This journey on the mysterious island was created by Iron Dog Studio and played on a 5-reel, 10-payline machine. The gameplay is relatively simple, but the potential for big wins is high. When an Excalibur wild symbol lands on the top position of any reel, it expands to fill that reel. Landing 3, 4, or 5 Crown scatters triggers the Free Spins feature of the game. You will play the free spins with a special expanding symbol. See what else Merlin, Guinevere, and Arthur have in store in our in-depth review of Crown of Avalon.\n\nOnce again, we have the opportunity to play through a game inspired by King Arthur and his adventures. Crown of Avalon is a slot machine by Iron Dog Studio that offers decent graphics and average rewards, along with what appears to be higher volatility than one would like. It puts on a decent show and offers adequate features, so it's not a bad entry in this already crowded category.\n\nCrown of Avalon has 5x3 reels and 10 active paylines. Despite the high volatility, it pays up to 2,000x the bet and maintains an average RTP of 96%. It's respectable overall, especially when you consider the game's free spins, along with expanding wilds and scatters.\n\nThe design of Crown of Avalon slot is well-crafted. Set against a rustic green background with the famous sword in the stone, the soundtrack has both a traditional and magical feel, while also being quite modern. The symbols are well-drawn and look fresh, creating a good overall atmosphere.\n\nThe reels include heraldic symbols from A to 10 alongside more rewarding symbols that refer to Arthurian legends. There is a wizard, Merlin the magician, and Queen Guinevere. The best of the standard symbols is naturally King Arthur himself. He will give you a prize of 1, 5, 20, or 200 times your stake if you land 2, 3, 4, or 5 on a payline.\n\nThe legendary sword of King Arthur is the wild symbol. It replaces all standard symbols when it is part of a winning combination.\n\nPlayers can enjoy this Arthurian adventure on all devices, including PC, tablet, and mobile. The sleek and colorful graphics work very well on the Crown of Avalon mobile slot, as does the simple gameplay.\n\nCrown of Avalon slot machine features a couple of added features, and the expanding wild nature is the first one I would like to mention. There will be Excalibur, the magical sword of King Arthur, and it ends up covering the entire reel if it appears at the top of the column. Unfortunately, if it doesn't reach the top, it remains a regular-sized wild symbol. Either way, you get some help from it to form new combinations, and it can form its own wins too. In fact, to get a jackpot of 2,000x, it is necessary that those expanding wilds take over all the reels and form their own wins on the 10 lines (each pays 200x the bet).\n\nLet's take a look at the scatter symbol, whose image is that of the Shield & Crown. These must land in random positions but on at least 3 reels. If you get it on only 1 or 2 reels, it will be used as an additional wild.\n\nIn addition to 10 free spins, their appearance will also bring a reward of up to 200x the bet. To trigger the free spins, you need 3 or 5 more scatters to land on the reels during the same round.\n\nIn a move reminiscent of the popular Book of Ra slots, the free spins are played with a special symbol chosen at random from the regular icons. This special symbol gains the ability to expand and take complete control of its reels.\n\nYou can start very low when playing Crown of Avalon, as the minimum bet required is €0.10. The upper limit is €50, which is a bit closer to high roller territory, but not quite there.\n\n€100,000 seems to be the big win possible in Crown of Avalon, a slot machine that offers rewards up to 2,000x the bet. The volatility is high, so the risk is significant, while the rewards are not as interesting as they should be for that kind of action.\n\nIn the end, however, it's all about the RTP level, which will be the standard 96%, which tells us that the game is more or less fair compared to most of its competitors, despite its unattractive combination of volatility/jackpot.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nEmbark on a journey to the mythical island for a chance to win on Microgaming's 5-reel, 20-payline Avalon slot game. The five reels and three rows of symbols on the game bring excitement with gameplay that may seem dated but still powerful, both in the experience it creates and in the potential wins.

See what Merlin, Guinevere, and Arthur have in store for you in our detailed Crown of Avalon review.\n\nOnce again, we get to immerse ourselves in the world of King Arthur and his adventures. Crown of Avalon, created by Iron Dog Studio, boasts decent graphics and average prizes, as well as higher volatility than one would expect. Nevertheless, it delivers a decent show and offers adequate features, making it a solid entry in this rather crowded category.\n\nCrown of Avalon offers a 5x3 reel setup and 10 active paylines. Despite the higher volatility, it pays out up to 2,000x your bet while maintaining an average RTP of 96%. Overall, this is pretty decent, especially when you factor in the game's free spins feature, expanding wilds, and scatters.\n\nLegendary Graphics\n\nThe design of Crown of Avalon is well-executed. For those unfamiliar with Arthurian legend, Avalon was the magical island where King Arthur's sword Excalibur was forged. Arthur was taken to the island to recover from his injuries sustained in the Battle of Camlann.\n\nThe game is set against a rustic green background featuring the famous sword in the stone. The soundtrack is traditional and mystical yet modern. The symbols are well-drawn and fresh. And, altogether, the design sets a great atmosphere.\n\nThe reels feature heraldic symbols from A to 10 alongside more rewarding symbols related to the Arthurian theme. These include a sorceress, Merlin the wizard, and Queen Guinevere. The best standard symbol is, of course, King Arthur himself. Landing 2, 3, 4, or 5 symbols on a payline will score you a prize of 1x, 5x, 20x, or 200x your bet, respectively.\n\nThe legendary Excalibur sword is the game's wild. It substitutes for all standard symbols in a winning combination. You can play this Arthurian adventure on any device, including PC, tablet, and mobile. The sleek and colorful graphics work great on the Crown of Avalon mobile slot, just like the simple gameplay.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nCrown of Avalon adds a couple of features, and the expanding wild is the first one worth mentioning. There's Excalibur, King Arthur's mythical sword, which covers the entire reel if it lands on the top position. Unfortunately, if it doesn't, it remains a regular-sized wild symbol. In any case, it provides some help in forming new combinations and can form its own winning combos, too. In fact, to win the 2,000x jackpot, you need those expanding wilds to take over all the reels and form their own wins on all 10 paylines, each paying out 200x your bet.\n\nNext up, we have the scatter symbol, which depicts a shield and a crown. These must land in random positions, but on at least 3 reels. If you get it on only 1 or 2 reels, it will be used as an additional wild. In addition to unlocking 10 free spins, the appearance of 3 or more scatters awards up to 200x your bet. Landing 3 or 5 scatters during the same round will trigger the free spins feature again.\n\nIn a move that's reminiscent of slots inspired by the popular Book of Ra, the free spins are played with a special symbol, randomly chosen from the regular icons. This special icon gains the ability to expand and take full control of its reels.\n\nYou can start low when playing Crown of Avalon, as the minimum bet required is €0.10. The other end is €50, which is a bit closer to high roller territory, but not quite there. The maximum potential payout in Crown of Avalon is €100,000, with prizes going up to 2,000x your bet. The volatility is high, so the risk is considerable, while the rewards aren't as enticing as they should be for that level of action. But, ultimately, what matters is the game's RTP, which stands at the standard 96%, making it more or less fair compared to its competition, despite the unattractive combination of volatility/jackpot.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nEmbark on a journey to the mythical island and spin to win on Microgaming's five-reel, 20-payline Avalon slot game.

Se lo si ottiene su 1 o 2 soli rulli, verrà utilizzato come wild aggiuntivo.\nOltre a 10 rotazioni libere, il loro aspetto porterà anche una ricompensa fino a 200x la posta in gioco. Per recuperare i giri liberi, sono necessari altri 3 o 5 scatters che atterrino sulle bobine, durante lo stesso round.\nIn una mossa che ricorda le slot ispirate alla più famosa Book of Ra, i giri liberi vengono giocati con un simbolo speciale, scelto a caso tra le icone regolari. Questo simbolo speciale guadagna la possibilità di espandersi e di prendere completamente il controllo dei suoi rulli.\nSi può iniziare molto basso quando si gioca a Crown of Avalon, dato che 0,10€ è la puntata minima richiesta. L’altra estremità è a €50, che è un po’ più vicina al territorio dei rulli alti, senza arrivarci davvero.\n€100.000 sembra essere la grande vincita possibile in Crown of Avalon, una slot machine che ha premi fino a 2.000x la puntata da offrire. La volatilità è elevata, quindi il rischio è notevole, mentre le ricompense non sono così interessanti come dovrebbero essere per quel tipo di azione.\nIn definitiva, però, conta il livello del RTP, che sarà al 96% standard, il che ci dice che il gioco è più o meno equo della maggior parte dei suoi concorrenti, nonostante il suo abbinamento poco attraente di volatilità/jackpot.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nViaggio nella mitica isola per girare per avere la possibilità di vincere sul gioco di slot a cinque rulli e 20 payline Avalon di Microgaming. I cinque rulli e le tre file sul gioco portano l’eccitazione con il gioco che ora sembra datato, ma ancora potente, sia nell’esperienza che crea che nelle potenziali vincite. Qui c’è un bonus gratuito per i giri e poche altre caratteristiche.\n\n        ",

This 5-reel, 10-payline adventure takes you on a journey to a mysterious island. The gameplay is simple yet thrilling, with the Excalibur wild symbol expanding to fill the entire reel. Landing 3, 4, or 5 scatter crowns triggers the exciting free spins feature, complete with special expanding symbols. See what Merlin, Guinevere, and Arthur have in store for you in our detailed Crown of Avalon review.\n\nOnce again, we get to immerse ourselves in the world of King Arthur and his adventures. Crown of Avalon, created by Iron Dog Studio, boasts decent graphics and average prizes, as well as higher volatility than one would expect. Nevertheless, it delivers a decent show and offers adequate features, making it a solid entry in this rather crowded category.\n\nCrown of Avalon offers a 5x3 reel setup and 10 active paylines. Despite the higher volatility, it pays out up to 2,000x your bet while maintaining an average RTP of 96%. Overall, this is pretty decent, especially when you factor in the game's free spins feature, expanding wilds, and scatters.\n\nLegendary Graphics\n\nThe design of Crown of Avalon is well-executed. For those unfamiliar with Arthurian legend, Avalon was the magical island where King Arthur's sword Excalibur was forged. Arthur was taken to the island to recover from his injuries sustained in the Battle of Camlann.\n\nThe game is set against a rustic green background featuring the famous sword in the stone. The soundtrack is traditional and mystical yet modern. The symbols are well-drawn and fresh. And, altogether, the design sets a great atmosphere.\n\nThe reels feature heraldic symbols from A to 10 alongside more rewarding symbols related to the Arthurian theme. These include a sorceress, Merlin the wizard, and Queen Guinevere. The best standard symbol is, of course, King Arthur himself. Landing 2, 3, 4, or 5 symbols on a payline will score you a prize of 1x, 5x, 20x, or 200x your bet, respectively.\n\nThe legendary Excalibur sword is the game's wild. It substitutes for all standard symbols in a winning combination. You can play this Arthurian adventure on any device, including PC, tablet, and mobile. The sleek and colorful graphics work great on the Crown of Avalon mobile slot, just like the simple gameplay.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nCrown of Avalon adds a couple of features, and the expanding wild is the first one worth mentioning. There's Excalibur, King Arthur's mythical sword, which covers the entire reel if it lands on the top position. Unfortunately, if it doesn't, it remains a regular-sized wild symbol. In any case, it provides some help in forming new combinations and can form its own winning combos, too. In fact, to win the 2,000x jackpot, you need those expanding wilds to take over all the reels and form their own wins on all 10 paylines, each paying out 200x your bet.\n\nNext up, we have the scatter symbol, which depicts a shield and a crown. These must land in random positions, but on at least 3 reels. If you get it on only 1 or 2 reels, it will be used as an additional wild. In addition to unlocking 10 free spins, the appearance of 3 or more scatters awards up to 200x your bet. Landing 3 or 5 scatters during the same round will trigger the free spins feature again.\n\nIn a move that's reminiscent of slots inspired by the popular Book of Ra, the free spins are played with a special symbol, randomly chosen from the regular icons. This special icon gains the ability to expand and take full control of its reels.\n\nYou can start low when playing Crown of Avalon, as the minimum bet required is €0.10. The other end is €50, which is a bit closer to high roller territory, but not quite there. The maximum potential payout in Crown of Avalon is €100,000, with prizes going up to 2,000x your bet. The volatility is high, so the risk is considerable, while the rewards aren't as enticing as they should be for that level of action. But, ultimately, what matters is the game's RTP, which stands at the standard 96%, making it more or less fair compared to its competition, despite the unattractive combination of volatility/jackpot.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nEmbark on a journey to the mythical island and spin to win on Microgaming's five-reel, 20-payline Avalon slot game. The five reels and three rows offer excitement with gameplay that now seems dated yet still powerful in its ability to provide players with an immersive experience and potential wins. There's a bonus featuring free spins and few other features offered."

This journey on the mysterious island was created by Iron Dog Studio and played on a 5-reel, 10-payline machine. The gameplay is relatively simple, but the potential for big wins is high. When an Excalibur wild symbol lands on the top position of any reel, it expands to fill that reel. Landing 3, 4, or 5 Crown scatters triggers the Free Spins feature of the game. You will play the free spins with a special expanding symbol. See what else Merlin, Guinevere, and Arthur have in store in our in-depth review of Crown of Avalon.\n\nOnce again, we have the opportunity to play through a game inspired by King Arthur and his adventures. Crown of Avalon is a slot machine by Iron Dog Studio that offers decent graphics and average rewards, along with what appears to be higher volatility than one would like. It puts on a decent show and offers adequate features, so it's not a bad entry in this already crowded category.\n\nCrown of Avalon has 5x3 reels and 10 active paylines. Despite the high volatility, it pays up to 2,000x the bet and maintains an average RTP of 96%. It's respectable overall, especially when you consider the game's free spins, along with expanding wilds and scatters.\n\nThe design of Crown of Avalon slot is well-crafted. Set against a rustic green background with the famous sword in the stone, the soundtrack has both a traditional and magical feel, while also being quite modern. The symbols are well-drawn and look fresh, creating a good overall atmosphere.\n\nThe reels include heraldic symbols from A to 10 alongside more rewarding symbols that refer to Arthurian legends. There is a wizard, Merlin the magician, and Queen Guinevere. The best of the standard symbols is naturally King Arthur himself. He will give you a prize of 1, 5, 20, or 200 times your stake if you land 2, 3, 4, or 5 on a payline.\n\nThe legendary sword of King Arthur is the wild symbol. It replaces all standard symbols when it is part of a winning combination.\n\nPlayers can enjoy this Arthurian adventure on all devices, including PC, tablet, and mobile. The sleek and colorful graphics work very well on the Crown of Avalon mobile slot, as does the simple gameplay.\n\nCrown of Avalon slot machine features a couple of added features, and the expanding wild nature is the first one I would like to mention. There will be Excalibur, the magical sword of King Arthur, and it ends up covering the entire reel if it appears at the top of the column. Unfortunately, if it doesn't reach the top, it remains a regular-sized wild symbol. Either way, you get some help from it to form new combinations, and it can form its own wins too. In fact, to get a jackpot of 2,000x, it is necessary that those expanding wilds take over all the reels and form their own wins on the 10 lines (each pays 200x the bet).\n\nLet's take a look at the scatter symbol, whose image is that of the Shield & Crown. These must land in random positions but on at least 3 reels. If you get it on only 1 or 2 reels, it will be used as an additional wild.\n\nIn addition to 10 free spins, their appearance will also bring a reward of up to 200x the bet. To trigger the free spins, you need 3 or 5 more scatters to land on the reels during the same round.\n\nIn a move reminiscent of the popular Book of Ra slots, the free spins are played with a special symbol chosen at random from the regular icons. This special symbol gains the ability to expand and take complete control of its reels.\n\nYou can start very low when playing Crown of Avalon, as the minimum bet required is €0.10. The upper limit is €50, which is a bit closer to high roller territory, but not quite there.\n\n€100,000 seems to be the big win possible in Crown of Avalon, a slot machine that offers rewards up to 2,000x the bet. The volatility is high, so the risk is significant, while the rewards are not as interesting as they should be for that kind of action.\n\nIn the end, however, it's all about the RTP level, which will be the standard 96%, which tells us that the game is more or less fair compared to most of its competitors, despite its unattractive combination of volatility/jackpot.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nEmbark on a journey to the mythical island for a chance to win on Microgaming's 5-reel, 20-payline Avalon slot game. The five reels and three rows of symbols on the game bring excitement with gameplay that may seem dated but still powerful, both in the experience it creates and in the potential wins. There is a bonus for free spins, but few other features to speak of.\n            ",

It's like playing Russian roulette... You know the reward's excitement is going to hit you eventually, but it's a question of when. And if we're really honest, the potential for a huge payoff comes with unattractive jackpot balances, so enjoyment is going to come from your wins, irrespective of how much you strike.</p><p>In conclusion, while Crown of Avalon doesn't knock our socks off, it's a consistently fun and entertaining experience. You won't lose your shirt, but neither will you come home with a crown. </p>\"\n}"

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame Features\n\nCrown of Avalon features expanding wilds that can fill an entire reel when Excalibur lands on the top position. Players can trigger free spins by landing 3, 4, or 5 Crown scatters, and during the free spins, a special symbol is chosen at random to expand and take over its reel.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nCrown of Avalon's design is well-crafted, with symbols inspired by Arthurian legends and a rustic green background featuring the sword in the stone. The soundtrack has a traditional and magical feel while being modern and offers a solid overall atmosphere.\n\nCompatibility with Devices\n\nPlayers can enjoy Crown of Avalon on all devices, including PC, tablet, and mobile. The game's sleek and colorful graphics work well on the mobile version, and the gameplay is simple.\n\nSymbol Set\n\nCrown of Avalon features heraldic symbols from A to 10 alongside symbols that refer to Arthurian legends, such as Merlin and Queen Guinevere. The highest paying symbol is King Arthur, who can give players a prize of 1, 5, 20, or 200 times their stake if they land 2, 3, 4, or 5 on a payline.\n\nPayouts and Volatility\n\nCrown of Avalon has high volatility but pays up to 2,000x the bet and has an average RTP of 96%. The minimum bet required is €0.10, and the upper limit is €50. The game offers decent rewards but carries significant risk.\n\nReturn to Player Percentage (RTP)\n\nCrown of Avalon offers an average RTP of 96%, making it a fair game compared to most of its competitors.\n\nOverall Gameplay Experience\n\nCrown of Avalon is a decent entry in the crowded category of Arthurian-inspired slot machines. The game offers some added features such as expanding wilds and free spins with a special symbol, making it relatively simple with the potential for big wins. However, the game's high volatility and unattractive combination of volatility/jackpot balance the rewards' excitement. In conclusion, Crown of Avalon offers an adequate overall experience.\n\n        \n            ",

This journey on the mysterious island was created by Iron Dog Studio and played on a 5-reel, 10-payline machine. The gameplay is relatively simple, but the potential for big wins is high. When an Excalibur wild symbol lands on the top position of any reel, it expands to fill that reel. Landing 3, 4, or 5 Crown scatters triggers the Free Spins feature of the game. You will play the free spins with a special expanding symbol. See what else Merlin, Guinevere, and Arthur have in store in our in-depth review of Crown of Avalon.\n\nOnce again, we have the opportunity to play through a game inspired by King Arthur and his adventures. Crown of Avalon is a slot machine by Iron Dog Studio that offers decent graphics and average rewards, along with what appears to be higher volatility than one would like. It puts on a decent show and offers adequate features, so it's not a bad entry in this already crowded category.\n\nCrown of Avalon has 5x3 reels and 10 active paylines. Despite the high volatility, it pays up to 2,000x the bet and maintains an average RTP of 96%. It's respectable overall, especially when you consider the game's free spins, along with expanding wilds and scatters.\n\nThe design of Crown of Avalon slot is well-crafted. Set against a rustic green background with the famous sword in the stone, the soundtrack has both a traditional and magical feel, while also being quite modern. The symbols are well-drawn and look fresh, creating a good overall atmosphere.\n\nThe reels include heraldic symbols from A to 10 alongside more rewarding symbols that refer to Arthurian legends. There is a wizard, Merlin the magician, and Queen Guinevere. The best of the standard symbols is naturally King Arthur himself. He will give you a prize of 1, 5, 20, or 200 times your stake if you land 2, 3, 4, or 5 on a payline.\n\nThe legendary sword of King Arthur is the wild symbol. It replaces all standard symbols when it is part of a winning combination.\n\nPlayers can enjoy this Arthurian adventure on all devices, including PC, tablet, and mobile. The sleek and colorful graphics work very well on the Crown of Avalon mobile slot, as does the simple gameplay.\n\nCrown of Avalon slot machine features a couple of added features, and the expanding wild nature is the first one I would like to mention. There will be Excalibur, the magical sword of King Arthur, and it ends up covering the entire reel if it appears at the top of the column. Unfortunately, if it doesn't reach the top, it remains a regular-sized wild symbol. Either way, you get some help from it to form new combinations, and it can form its own wins too. In fact, to get a jackpot of 2,000x, it is necessary that those expanding wilds take over all the reels and form their own wins on the 10 lines (each pays 200x the bet).\n\nLet's take a look at the scatter symbol, whose image is that of the Shield & Crown. These must land in random positions but on at least 3 reels. If you get it on only 1 or 2 reels, it will be used as an additional wild.\n\nIn addition to 10 free spins, their appearance will also bring a reward of up to 200x the bet. To trigger the free spins, you need 3 or 5 more scatters to land on the reels during the same round.\n\nIn a move reminiscent of the popular Book of Ra slots, the free spins are played with a special symbol chosen at random from the regular icons. This special symbol gains the ability to expand and take complete control of its reels.\n\nYou can start very low when playing Crown of Avalon, as the minimum bet required is €0.10. The upper limit is €50, which is a bit closer to high roller territory, but not quite there.\n\n€100,000 seems to be the big win possible in Crown of Avalon, a slot machine that offers rewards up to 2,000x the bet. The volatility is high, so the risk is significant, while the rewards are not as interesting as they should be for that kind of action.\n\nIn the end, however, it's all about the RTP level, which will be the standard 96%, which tells us that the game is more or less fair compared to most of its competitors, despite its unattractive combination of volatility/jackpot.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nEmbark on a journey to the mythical island for a chance to win on Microgaming's 5-reel, 20-payline Avalon slot game. The five reels and three rows of symbols on the game bring excitement with gameplay that may seem dated but still powerful, both in the experience it creates and in the potential wins. There is a bonus for free spins, but few other features to speak of.\n            ",
