Created by Skywind, this 6-reel, 4,096 ways to win game comes with stacked paying symbols and a Free Games feature that can reward unlimited free spins with wilds that double or triple payouts when part of a winning combination. Play this high variance slot on your computer, tablet or smartphone for bets ranging from 40 cents to €320 per spin.\n\nIf you enjoy playing wildlife-themed slots, then you’ve probably come across several games where buffalos rampage on the reels. Our Big Buffalo slot review will guide you through a game full of these majestic creatures, along with other animals from the American West.\n\nDeveloped by Skywind Group, the Big Buffalo online slot features six reels, four rows of symbols, and 4,096 different ways to win. Stacked symbols, wilds, and the chance to trigger up to 100 free spins with multipliers are some of the features you’ll discover in this rugged landscape.\n\nWhen you play the Big Buffalo slot machine, you'll enjoy exciting and high-volatility gameplay. There's also a wide range of bets to suit both casual and high-level players.\n\nA nature lover's graphic experience\n\nThe huge mountains, spires, and mesas that are so iconic of the American West rise behind the reels of the Big Buffalo slot game. It's a dramatic image, although if playing on an Android, Windows, or iOS mobile device, the reels fill most of the screen, and part of this breathtaking view is lost.\n\nBut we're here to experience the thrill of playing a nature-themed slot game, not to admire the scenery. It's what we see on the Big Buffalo online slot game reels that matter, and our slot reviewers are pleased to say that many of the symbols are as impressive as the background.\n\nBobcats, foxes, wolves, and bald eagles follow the reels of the Big Buffalo slot machine, along with the high-yield buffalo. The lower value symbols are not as impressive, consisting of standard playing card icons ranging from 9 to A.\n\nWhile some players may enjoy seeing these familiar symbols, our Big Buffalo slot machine reviewers always prefer to see all symbols related to the general theme.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Playtech co-founder Skywind Group, it could be one of the biggest game developers you've never heard of. However, their expanding range and presence in many online and mobile casinos could soon change that.\n\nLike all Skywind games, the Big Buffalo slot machine is fully licensed to ensure fair play at all times.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nLoad the Big Buffalo slot game on your PC or mobile device, and the first thing you'll see is a large and angry-looking buffalo charging towards the screen. This dramatic view quickly changes with the appearance of the reels, and our reviewers found that the Big Buffalo slot machine loaded smoothly on a desktop computer and an iPhone.\n\nPayouts are made from left to right in any position on the adjacent reels, giving you a wide 4,096 different ways to line up matching symbols. It is played with 40 coins, adjusting the value of each from a minimum of 0.01 to a maximum of 8.00. This gives you the potential to play the Big Buffalo Slot with bets ranging from 0.40 to 320.00 per spin.\n\nHowever, remember that this is a high-volatility game. You may find yourself playing through several spins before landing a winning combination, although wins will tend to be higher to compensate. Overall, the Big Buffalo online slot comes with a generous 95.5% return percentage to players.\n\nThe Big Buffalo slot machine game offers you a simple auto on/off option, while the spin button on the control panel activates a fast spin mode. A paytable reveals how much each symbol is worth.\n\nThe low-value symbols 9 and 10 return ten coins when landing on three reels from the left-hand side, with a maximum of 100 coins paid out when all six reels appear. At the other end of the scale, the buffalo is worth 40 coins when found only on the first two swings and a maximum of 300 coins when charging through all six.\n\nStacked symbols can help complete winning combinations.\n\nAn image of the West's mountains serves as the wild symbol in the Big Buffalo online slot game. It doesn't pay anything but replaces other symbols (except scattered Free Games). Our Big Buffalo slot machine review team found that its frequent appearance was very helpful in completing multiple winning sequences.\n\nWatch out for the Free Games bonus symbol. Every three in view triggers eight free spins, while four will bring 15 extra games. If you see five of these symbols anywhere on the reels, 25 spins are played. A massive 100 extra spins are yours when six bonus symbols appear on the Big Buffalo online slot.\n\nOther similar slot machines include GamingSoft's Buffalo Blaze slot, where an entire herd of furious creatures, along with chameleons, foxes, and a misplaced tiger, appears. A cattle skull serves as the wild symbol, while the buffalo launches a free spin with multipliers.\n            ",

Created by Skywind, this 6-reel, 4,096 ways to win game comes with stacked paying symbols and a Free Games feature that can reward unlimited free spins with wilds that double or triple payouts when part of a winning combination. Play this high variance slot on your computer, tablet or smartphone for bets ranging from 40 cents to €320 per spin.\n\nIf you enjoy playing wildlife-themed slots, then you’ve probably come across several games where buffalos rampage on the reels. Our Big Buffalo slot review will guide you through a game full of these majestic creatures, along with other animals from the American West.\n\nDeveloped by Skywind Group, the Big Buffalo online slot features six reels, four rows of symbols, and 4,096 different ways to win. Stacked symbols, wilds, and the chance to trigger up to 100 free spins with multipliers are some of the features you’ll discover in this rugged landscape.\n\nWhen you play the Big Buffalo slot machine, you'll enjoy exciting and high-volatility gameplay. There's also a wide range of bets to suit both casual and high-level players.\n\nA nature lover's graphic experience\n\nThe huge mountains, spires, and mesas that are so iconic of the American West rise behind the reels of the Big Buffalo slot game. It's a dramatic image, although if playing on an Android, Windows, or iOS mobile device, the reels fill most of the screen, and part of this breathtaking view is lost.\n\nBut we're here to experience the thrill of playing a nature-themed slot game, not to admire the scenery. It's what we see on the Big Buffalo online slot game reels that matter, and our slot reviewers are pleased to say that many of the symbols are as impressive as the background.\n\nBobcats, foxes, wolves, and bald eagles follow the reels of the Big Buffalo slot machine, along with the high-yield buffalo. The lower value symbols are not as impressive, consisting of standard playing card icons ranging from 9 to A.\n\nWhile some players may enjoy seeing these familiar symbols, our Big Buffalo slot machine reviewers always prefer to see all symbols related to the general theme.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Playtech co-founder Skywind Group, it could be one of the biggest game developers you've never heard of. However, their expanding range and presence in many online and mobile casinos could soon change that.\n\nLike all Skywind games, the Big Buffalo slot machine is fully licensed to ensure fair play at all times.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nLoad the Big Buffalo slot game on your PC or mobile device, and the first thing you'll see is a large and angry-looking buffalo charging towards the screen. This dramatic view quickly changes with the appearance of the reels, and our reviewers found that the Big Buffalo slot machine loaded smoothly on a desktop computer and an iPhone.\n\nPayouts are made from left to right in any position on the adjacent reels, giving you a wide 4,096 different ways to line up matching symbols. It is played with 40 coins, adjusting the value of each from a minimum of 0.01 to a maximum of 8.00. This gives you the potential to play the Big Buffalo Slot with bets ranging from 0.40 to 320.00 per spin.\n\nHowever, remember that this is a high-volatility game. You may find yourself playing through several spins before landing a winning combination, although wins will tend to be higher to compensate. Overall, the Big Buffalo online slot comes with a generous 95.5% return percentage to players.\n\nThe Big Buffalo slot machine game offers you a simple auto on/off option, while the spin button on the control panel activates a fast spin mode. A paytable reveals how much each symbol is worth.\n\nThe low-value symbols 9 and 10 return ten coins when landing on three reels from the left-hand side, with a maximum of 100 coins paid out when all six reels appear. At the other end of the scale, the buffalo is worth 40 coins when found only on the first two swings and a maximum of 300 coins when charging through all six.\n\nStacked symbols can help complete winning combinations.\n\nAn image of the West's mountains serves as the wild symbol in the Big Buffalo online slot game. It doesn't pay anything but replaces other symbols (except scattered Free Games). Our Big Buffalo slot machine review team found that its frequent appearance was very helpful in completing multiple winning sequences.\n\nWatch out for the Free Games bonus symbol. Every three in view triggers eight free spins, while four will bring 15 extra games. If you see five of these symbols anywhere on the reels, 25 spins are played. A massive 100 extra spins are yours when six bonus symbols appear on the Big Buffalo online slot.\n\nOther similar slot machines include GamingSoft's Buffalo Blaze slot, where an entire herd of furious creatures, along with chameleons, foxes, and a misplaced tiger, appears. A cattle skull serves as the wild symbol, while the buffalo launches a free spin with multipliers.\n            ",

Stacked symbols, wilds, and the chance to trigger up to 100 free spins with multipliers are some of the features you’ll discover in this rugged landscape.\n\nWhen you play the Big Buffalo slot machine, you'll enjoy exciting and high-volatility gameplay. There's also a wide range of bets to suit both casual and high-level players.\n\nA nature lover's graphic experience\n\nThe huge mountains, spires, and mesas that are so iconic of the American West rise behind the reels of the Big Buffalo slot game. It's a dramatic image, although if playing on an Android, Windows, or iOS mobile device, the reels fill most of the screen, and part of this breathtaking view is lost.\n\nBut we're here to experience the thrill of playing a nature-themed slot game, not to admire the scenery. It's what we see on the Big Buffalo online slot game reels that matter, and our slot reviewers are pleased to say that many of the symbols are as impressive as the background.\n\nBobcats, foxes, wolves, and bald eagles follow the reels of the Big Buffalo slot machine, along with the high-yield buffalo. The lower value symbols are not as impressive, consisting of standard playing card icons ranging from 9 to A.\n\nWhile some players may enjoy seeing these familiar symbols, our Big Buffalo slot machine reviewers always prefer to see all symbols related to the general theme.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Playtech co-founder Skywind Group, it could be one of the biggest game developers you've never heard of. However, their expanding range and presence in many online and mobile casinos could soon change that.\n\nLike all Skywind games, the Big Buffalo slot machine is fully licensed to ensure fair play at all times.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nLoad the Big Buffalo slot game on your PC or mobile device, and the first thing you'll see is a large and angry-looking buffalo charging towards the screen. This dramatic view quickly changes with the appearance of the reels, and our reviewers found that the Big Buffalo slot machine loaded smoothly on a desktop computer and an iPhone.\n\nPayouts are made from left to right in any position on the adjacent reels, giving you a wide 4,096 different ways to line up matching symbols. It is played with 40 coins, adjusting the value of each from a minimum of 0.01 to a maximum of 8.00. This gives you the potential to play the Big Buffalo Slot with bets ranging from 0.40 to 320.00 per spin.\n\nHowever, remember that this is a high-volatility game. You may find yourself playing through several spins before landing a winning combination, although wins will tend to be higher to compensate. Overall, the Big Buffalo online slot comes with a generous 95.5% return percentage to players.\n\nThe Big Buffalo slot machine game offers you a simple auto on/off option, while the spin button on the control panel activates a fast spin mode. A paytable reveals how much each symbol is worth.\n\nThe low-value symbols 9 and 10 return ten coins when landing on three reels from the left-hand side, with a maximum of 100 coins paid out when all six reels appear. At the other end of the scale, the buffalo is worth 40 coins when found only on the first two swings and a maximum of 300 coins when charging through all six.\n\nStacked symbols can help complete winning combinations.\n\nAn image of the West's mountains serves as the wild symbol in the Big Buffalo online slot game. It doesn't pay anything but replaces other symbols (except scattered Free Games). Our Big Buffalo slot machine review team found that its frequent appearance was very helpful in completing multiple winning sequences.\n\nWatch out for the Free Games bonus symbol. Every three in view triggers eight free spins, while four will bring 15 extra games. If you see five of these symbols anywhere on the reels, 25 spins are played. A massive 100 extra spins are yours when six bonus symbols appear on the Big Buffalo online slot.\n\nOther similar slot machines include GamingSoft's Buffalo Blaze slot, where an entire herd of furious creatures, along with chameleons, foxes, and a misplaced tiger, appears. A cattle skull serves as the wild symbol, while the buffalo launches a free spin with multipliers.\n            ",
