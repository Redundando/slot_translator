I 4 maghi sono invece i simboli di maggior valore. Per fare un esempio, con 5 simboli di Septimer si guadagna 300 volte la puntata, con Alaba 400, con Vortiger 500 e con Palladio ben 1.000! Abbiamo poi i 3 simboli speciali. Il libro rappresenta il Wild. Oltre ad essere pagante, esso ha funge da Jolly, andando a sostituire tutti i simboli regolari ma non quelli speciali.\nAbbiamo poi il simbolo Scatter. Anche ad esso è associata una ricompensa in denaro, seppur più bassa di quella che si ottiene con il simbolo Wild. È rappresentato da un bastone magico e ha la funzione di moltiplicare le vincite. C’è poi la sfera di cristallo che può comparire solo sui rulli 2, 3 e 4 e regala 3 giri gratuiti. Prima di cominciare il gioco Bonus, il giocatore dovrà scegliere un mago a cui sono associati 5, 7, 9 o 11 giri gratuiti. In seguito, si avrà la possibilità di scegliere uno degli oggetti magici e ottenere così un moltiplicatore pari a 2x, 3x, 4x o 5x. Se durante i giri gratuiti ricompariranno 3 sfere di cristallo, allora si avrà diritto a 8 ulteriori giri gratuiti sino a un massimo di 100.
