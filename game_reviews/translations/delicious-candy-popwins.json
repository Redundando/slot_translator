The crown is the most valuable symbol, paying up to 12.50 times for a combination of five. The game grid is a tray of sponge cake divided into squares and starts with a 5x3 design. The game expands the grid and adds new positions with every win, increasing the ways to win up to a maximum of 118,098 during Free Spins.\n\nPlaying Grid Expansion\n\nDelicious Candy PopWins has a unique playing grid that expands after every win. The new positions have added symbols, which, if involved in a winning combination, will lead to further growth of the grid. Expanding the grid also increases the number of ways to win. The grid's maximum size during the base game is six rows, and during Free Spins, it can grow up to nine rows.\n\nFree Spins and Multiplier Wheel\n\nUnlike many other slot games, Delicious Candy PopWins activates Free Spins when the grid reaches the maximum size of six rows during the base game. Players then spin the wheel to determine the number of Free Spins and the value of the multiplier applied to the winnings. At the highest multiplier, players can win up to 27,000 times their bet. During Free Spins, the grid can expand up to nine rows, and the maximum number of ways to win is 118,098.\n\nVolatility and RTP Rate\n\nThe Volatility of Delicious Candy PopWins is high, meaning that wins are less frequent. The Return To Player (RTP) rate is 95.8%, which is considered average for slots games. However, when making use of the factor multiplier feature, players must have an eye for volatility as this feature tends to be randomly activated.\n\nGame Technology and Betting Options\n\nDelicious Candy PopWins is built with HTML5 technology, making the game accessible across all devices. Players can choose the minimum bet of €0.20, with the Super Stake function, which activates a random multiplier symbol that lands on the reels, resulting in a win between x2 and x100. The game also features an automatic spins function and the ability to buy Bonus games.\n\n        \n            ",

On the right side, there is a small box displaying the various ways to win. Next to it are two buttons, the Start button and the Buy Bonus button.\n\nThe soft-shaped symbols give a three-dimensional sensation, and the 80s dance music perfectly complements the mood of the game.\n\nA Variable Grid\n\nAs mentioned in the presentation, the playing grid expands, meaning that it starts with 5 reels and 3 rows, and after every win, an additional row is added but only on the reels where the paying symbols are located. This means that new free positions will have added symbols that, if involved in a winning combination, will result in further growth of the grid. The ways to win initially start at 486, but with every new free position, the possibilities increase up to a maximum of 118,098 during Free Spins!\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.20, which doubles if you choose to activate the Super Stake function, resulting in multiplier symbols landing on the reels between x2 and x100.\n\nAmong the available functions to purchase are automatic spins and the Bonus game.\n\nThe volatility is high while the RTP rate is 95.8%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nLet's now take a closer look at the gameplay of Delicious Candy PopWins. The symbols include gummy candy, the number seven, the star, the BAR sign, and the crown. The latter is also the most profitable symbol, paying up to 12.50 times with a combination of 5. In the base game, the playing grid can reach a maximum size of 6 rows, while during Free Spins, it can go up to 9. Unlike many other slots, Free Spins are not triggered by Scatter but are activated when the grid reaches the maximum size of six rows. Players will then need to spin the wheel to determine the number of Free Spins and the value of the multiplier that will be applied to the winnings.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I play Delicious Candy PopWins on a tablet?\n\nYes, the game is also available in HTML5 technology.\n\nHow many ways to win are there?\n\nThe number of ways to win depends on the size of the grid.
