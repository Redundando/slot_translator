Con questa premessa inizia l’avventura sulla slot Happy Hour, che ti porta in vacanza tra navi, sole, mare e palme tutte da ammirare mentre tieni un cocktail in mano. Il viaggio verso tale meta esotica è reso speciale grazie alla creatività degli sviluppatori di WMG. Vediamo cosa hanno pensato per i gamer appassionati, spaziando tra gameplay e bonus, arrivando alle funzionalità extra e chiavi speciali che ti apriranno le porte verso un paradiso terrestre che, tra una bevuta e l’altra, mette in palio diverse vincite.\nLa grafica della slot Happy Hour\nLa rappresentazione del paradiso è fatta in stile fumetto, per rendere ancora più fantastica l’atmosfera, degna per i veri appassionati. Va detto: è una trovata che non ci saremmo mai aspettati vista la tematica, ma è bello essere spiazzati anche in termini di grafica.\nI simboli di gioco sono lo specchio della storia raccontata: si parte da una bottiglia che si stappa scelta come Wild, capace di attribuire 3x, 4x, 5x per vincite che arrivano rispettivamente fino a un massimo di 50, 100, 500. Si può porre al posto di ogni altra icona di gioco fatta eccezione per il simbolo Jolly. E’ seguita, in termini di importanza, dalla bellissima fanciulla con il suo drink in mano, il barman, un cocktail fruttato, un drink classico e le carte da gioco reinventate in stile aperitivo. Importante è il ruolo del simbolo Bonus che si presenta con tre bicchieri uniti.\nE’ doveroso ricordare che tutte le vincite che si ottengono sulle linee dovranno realizzarsi da sinistra a destra e sarà pagata solo la vincita con valore maggiore.\nFunzionalità speciali\nPartiamo dalla Fase Kiss, che si attiva quando trovi da 3 a 5 fanciulle nelle linee di gioco: il premio varia in base al numero di volte che lei apparirà nel giro. Con 3 si sblocca la vincita bronzo, con 4 quella argento e con 5 quella oro. Molto interessante è il Bonus game che si attiva quando si posizionano cinque simboli jolly sulla griglia. A quel punto il giocatore è proiettato in una nuova pagina, di fronte a una ruota della fortuna che ha due divere fasi. La prima ruota gira per selezionare il tipo di bonus che sarà attribuito.\nIl bonus più divertente, che farà impazzire i maschietti, è lo Strip Pong: in tal caso si dovrà riuscire a centrare letteralmente il bicchiere. Hai a tua disposizione fino a 20 tentativi che si dividono su 4 livelli. Per ognuno di questi dovrai prendere 5 bicchieri per fare in modo che la sexy fanciulla si tolga uno dei capi che indossa. Allettante no? Puoi ottenere un moltiplicatore interessante per far aumentare la vincita in base alle impostazioni di scommessa.\nE infine citiamo la funzione Beach Bar, che ha sempre 20 tentativi per farti scoprire i premi che ha preparato per te il tuo barman di fiducia. Puoi anche moltiplicare le vincite in denaro che trovi.\nConsiderazioni finali su Happy Hour\nE’ vero, con questa slot le calde temperature iniziano a farsi sentire: mettiti comodo e preparati a vivere qualche geniale colpo di scena. Il gioco scorre bene, in modo piacevole e difficilmente resterai deluso. Si presenta con un RTP al 90%, che è al sotto della media di mercato.\n",

It must be said: it is an unexpected discovery for the theme, but it is nice to be surprised even in terms of graphics.\n\nThe game symbols reflect the story being told: starting with a bottle that pops open chosen as the Wild symbol, capable of attributing 3x, 4x, 5x for winnings that reach up to a maximum of 50, 100, 500. It can be placed in place of any other game icon except for the Wild symbol.

With 3, the bronze win is unlocked, with 4 the silver win, and with 5, the gold win. The Bonus game is very interesting and is activated when five Wild symbols are positioned on the grid. At that point, the player is projected onto a new page, facing a wheel of fortune that has two different phases. The first wheel spins to select the type of bonus that will be awarded.\n\nThe funniest bonus that will make men go crazy is Strip Pong. In this case, you must literally hit the glass. You have up to 20 attempts divided into 4 levels. For each of these, you must hit 5 glasses so the sexy girl strips off one of her clothes. Tempting, isn't it? You can get an interesting multiplier to increase your winnings based on your betting settings.\n\nFinally, we mention the Beach Bar feature, which always has 20 attempts to help you discover the prizes that your trusted bartender has prepared for you. You can also multiply the cash winnings you find.\n\nFinal considerations on Happy Hour\nIt is true, with this slot game, the warm temperatures begin to be felt: get comfortable and get ready to experience some brilliant plot twists. The game runs smoothly, in a pleasant way, and you will hardly be disappointed. It comes with an RTP of 90%, which is below the market average.

This is where the adventure begins with Happy Hour slot game, taking you on vacation with ships, sun, sea, and palm trees all around you while you hold a cocktail in your hand. The journey to this exotic destination is made special thanks to the creativity of WMG developers. Let's see what they have in store for passionate gamers, ranging from gameplay and bonuses to extra features and special keys that will unlock the doors to a paradise on earth, where, between one drink and another, different winnings are at stake.\n\nThe graphics of Happy Hour slot game\nThe representation of paradise is made in a comic book style to make the atmosphere even more fantastic, suitable for true gambling enthusiasts. It must be said: it is an unexpected discovery for the theme, but it is nice to be surprised even in terms of graphics.\n\nThe game symbols reflect the story being told: starting with a bottle that pops open chosen as the Wild symbol, capable of attributing 3x, 4x, 5x for winnings that reach up to a maximum of 50, 100, 500. It can be placed in place of any other game icon except for the Wild symbol. This is followed, in terms of importance, by the beautiful girl with her drink in hand, the bartender, a fruity cocktail, a classic drink, and playing cards reinvented in an aperitif style. The role of the Bonus symbol, presented with three connected glasses, is important.\n\nIt is noteworthy that all winnings obtained on the lines must be realized from left to right, and only the highest-value winnings will be paid.\n\nSpecial features\nLet's start with the Kiss Phase, which is activated when you find 3 to 5 girls on the game lines: the prize varies based on the number of times she appears in the spin. With 3, the bronze win is unlocked, with 4 the silver win, and with 5, the gold win. The Bonus game is very interesting and is activated when five Wild symbols are positioned on the grid. At that point, the player is projected onto a new page, facing a wheel of fortune that has two different phases. The first wheel spins to select the type of bonus that will be awarded.\n\nThe funniest bonus that will make men go crazy is Strip Pong. In this case, you must literally hit the glass. You have up to 20 attempts divided into 4 levels. For each of these, you must hit 5 glasses so the sexy girl strips off one of her clothes. Tempting, isn't it? You can get an interesting multiplier to increase your winnings based on your betting settings.\n\nFinally, we mention the Beach Bar feature, which always has 20 attempts to help you discover the prizes that your trusted bartender has prepared for you. You can also multiply the cash winnings you find.\n\nFinal considerations on Happy Hour\nIt is true, with this slot game, the warm temperatures begin to be felt: get comfortable and get ready to experience some brilliant plot twists. The game runs smoothly, in a pleasant way, and you will hardly be disappointed. It comes with an RTP of 90%, which is below the market average. As an experienced gambler, prepare to have fun and enjoy the winning potential this game has to offer.\n            ",

This is where the adventure begins with Happy Hour slot game, taking you on vacation with ships, sun, sea, and palm trees all around you while you hold a cocktail in your hand. The journey to this exotic destination is made special thanks to the creativity of WMG developers. Let's see what they have in store for passionate gamers, ranging from gameplay and bonuses to extra features and special keys that will unlock the doors to a paradise on earth, where, between one drink and another, different winnings are at stake.\n\nThe graphics of Happy Hour slot game\nThe representation of paradise is made in a comic book style to make the atmosphere even more fantastic, suitable for true gambling enthusiasts. It must be said: it is an unexpected discovery for the theme, but it is nice to be surprised even in terms of graphics.\n\nThe game symbols reflect the story being told: starting with a bottle that pops open chosen as the Wild symbol, capable of attributing 3x, 4x, 5x for winnings that reach up to a maximum of 50, 100, 500. It can be placed in place of any other game icon except for the Wild symbol. This is followed, in terms of importance, by the beautiful girl with her drink in hand, the bartender, a fruity cocktail, a classic drink, and playing cards reinvented in an aperitif style. The role of the Bonus symbol, presented with three connected glasses, is important.\n\nIt is noteworthy that all winnings obtained on the lines must be realized from left to right, and only the highest-value winnings will be paid.\n\nSpecial features\nLet's start with the Kiss Phase, which is activated when you find 3 to 5 girls on the game lines: the prize varies based on the number of times she appears in the spin. With 3, the bronze win is unlocked, with 4 the silver win, and with 5, the gold win. The Bonus game is very interesting and is activated when five Wild symbols are positioned on the grid. At that point, the player is projected onto a new page, facing a wheel of fortune that has two different phases. The first wheel spins to select the type of bonus that will be awarded.\n\nThe funniest bonus that will make men go crazy is Strip Pong. In this case, you must literally hit the glass. You have up to 20 attempts divided into 4 levels. For each of these, you must hit 5 glasses so the sexy girl strips off one of her clothes. Tempting, isn't it? You can get an interesting multiplier to increase your winnings based on your betting settings.\n\nFinally, we mention the Beach Bar feature, which always has 20 attempts to help you discover the prizes that your trusted bartender has prepared for you. You can also multiply the cash winnings you find.\n\nFinal considerations on Happy Hour\nIt is true, with this slot game, the warm temperatures begin to be felt: get comfortable and get ready to experience some brilliant plot twists. The game runs smoothly, in a pleasant way, and you will hardly be disappointed. It comes with an RTP of 90%, which is below the market average. As an experienced gambler, prepare to have fun and enjoy the winning potential this game has to offer.\n        ",
