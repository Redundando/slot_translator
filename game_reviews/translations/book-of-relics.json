With the advent of online slot machines, software providers gradually abandoned Fruit Machines and began to explore more and more original themes, accompanied by special effects or the latest technologies in the field of three-dimensional animations.\n\nAncient civilization-themed slots, especially those set in the shadow of the pyramids of Egypt, are certainly the most popular: every respected software provider has one in its catalogue, and even Williams Interactive with its Book of Relics is fully part of this trend. Many ancient Egypt-themed slots revolve around images of ancient times, pyramids and desert settings, but Book of Relics instead uses an abandoned tomb as its background.\n\nThe graphics of this slot perfectly convey the atmosphere of darkness and mystery, and although it doesn't offer anything exceptional, we believe it manages to create the right atmosphere to ensure an engaging gaming experience. The protagonist of Book of Relics is the deity Anubis, with his half-human, half-canine features, who appears both on the initial screen and on the sides of the game grid, immersed in the sandy depths of the ancient tomb.\n\nMain features of the slot\nBook of Relics is the result of a collaboration between Williams Interactive (WMS) and Red 7, and is available on both desktop computers and mobile devices running Android, Windows and iOS. The game layout is traditional, with five reels, three rows, ten fixed paylines and winnings obtained by aligning identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right.\n\nThe Plus and Minus buttons, placed under the game grid, allow you to select the amount of your bet, ranging from a minimum of 10 cents to a maximum of €200 per spin, catering to all types of players. The declared theoretical return to player (RTP) for Book of Relics ranges from 94.36% to 96.36%.\n\nSymbols and features\nThe lowest value symbols are the numbers and letters that refer to playing cards, reproduced in Egyptian style, ranging from 10 to Ace in this case. To get more substantial winnings, you will have to hope that the thematic symbols appear on the reels, including a dagger, the deity with the bird head, the queen and the Pharaoh, which has the highest value, up to 5,000 times the bet amount when it appears on all five reels. The Wild of the game is the Book of Relics that gives the slot its title and, in addition to its function as a wild, it also acts as a scatter, allowing you to obtain a variable number of free spins, in which you can take advantage of some multipliers. The stacked symbols feature also increases the chances of winning, which is activated during free spins.\n            ",

The game has a traditional layout, with five reels, three rows, and ten fixed paylines. It can be played on desktop and mobile devices running on Android, Windows, and iOS.\n\nSymbols and Layout\n\nThe symbols in the game are a mix of playing cards adapted to the Egyptian theme and thematic symbols such as a dagger, the deity with the bird head, the queen, and the Pharaoh, which has the highest value, offering up to 5,000 times the bet amount when it appears on all five reels. The game's graphics convey the atmosphere of darkness and mystery, creating an engaging gaming experience with the abandoned tomb as the background. The game's layout consists of five reels, three rows, and ten fixed paylines, ensuring winnings are obtained by aligning identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right.\n\nBetting Range\n\nThe Plus and Minus buttons, placed under the game grid, allow players to select the amount of their bets, with a range from a minimum of 10 cents to a maximum of €200 per spin, catering to all kinds of players. The game's declared theoretical return to player (RTP) ranges from 94.36% to 96.36%.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nThe game's Wild symbol is the Book of Relics, which gives the slot its title. Besides functioning as a wild, it also acts as a scatter symbol, allowing players to obtain a variable number of free spins, in which they can benefit from some multipliers. This feature increases the chances of winning, which is activated during free spins.\n\nBonus Features\n\nBook of Relics offers players the opportunity to trigger various bonus features. The game's stacked symbols feature ensures more towering wins are achieved during the bonus round. The free spins feature activated when players land three or more Book of Relics symbols in one spin, giving them up to ten free spins, depending on the number of scatters landed. The feature can be reactivated if players land three or more scatters during the free spins round. Players can also gamble their winnings by choosing to play a 50/50 game with a correct guess of the card color doubling their winnings.\n\n        \n            ",

With the advent of online slot machines, software providers gradually abandoned Fruit Machines and began to explore more and more original themes, accompanied by special effects or the latest technologies in the field of three-dimensional animations.\n\nAncient civilization-themed slots, especially those set in the shadow of the pyramids of Egypt, are certainly the most popular: every respected software provider has one in its catalogue, and even Williams Interactive with its Book of Relics is fully part of this trend. Many ancient Egypt-themed slots revolve around images of ancient times, pyramids and desert settings, but Book of Relics instead uses an abandoned tomb as its background.\n\nThe graphics of this slot perfectly convey the atmosphere of darkness and mystery, and although it doesn't offer anything exceptional, we believe it manages to create the right atmosphere to ensure an engaging gaming experience. The protagonist of Book of Relics is the deity Anubis, with his half-human, half-canine features, who appears both on the initial screen and on the sides of the game grid, immersed in the sandy depths of the ancient tomb.\n\nMain features of the slot\nBook of Relics is the result of a collaboration between Williams Interactive (WMS) and Red 7, and is available on both desktop computers and mobile devices running Android, Windows and iOS. The game layout is traditional, with five reels, three rows, ten fixed paylines and winnings obtained by aligning identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right.\n\nThe Plus and Minus buttons, placed under the game grid, allow you to select the amount of your bet, ranging from a minimum of 10 cents to a maximum of €200 per spin, catering to all types of players. The declared theoretical return to player (RTP) for Book of Relics ranges from 94.36% to 96.36%.\n\nSymbols and features\nThe lowest value symbols are the numbers and letters that refer to playing cards, reproduced in Egyptian style, ranging from 10 to Ace in this case. To get more substantial winnings, you will have to hope that the thematic symbols appear on the reels, including a dagger, the deity with the bird head, the queen and the Pharaoh, which has the highest value, up to 5,000 times the bet amount when it appears on all five reels. The Wild of the game is the Book of Relics that gives the slot its title and, in addition to its function as a wild, it also acts as a scatter, allowing you to obtain a variable number of free spins, in which you can take advantage of some multipliers. The stacked symbols feature also increases the chances of winning, which is activated during free spins.\n            ",

With the advent of online slot machines, software providers gradually abandoned Fruit Machines and began to explore more and more original themes, accompanied by special effects or the latest technologies in the field of three-dimensional animations.\n\nAncient civilization-themed slots, especially those set in the shadow of the pyramids of Egypt, are certainly the most popular: every respected software provider has one in its catalogue, and even Williams Interactive with its Book of Relics is fully part of this trend. Many ancient Egypt-themed slots revolve around images of ancient times, pyramids and desert settings, but Book of Relics instead uses an abandoned tomb as its background.\n\nThe graphics of this slot perfectly convey the atmosphere of darkness and mystery, and although it doesn't offer anything exceptional, we believe it manages to create the right atmosphere to ensure an engaging gaming experience. The protagonist of Book of Relics is the deity Anubis, with his half-human, half-canine features, who appears both on the initial screen and on the sides of the game grid, immersed in the sandy depths of the ancient tomb.\n\nMain features of the slot\nBook of Relics is the result of a collaboration between Williams Interactive (WMS) and Red 7, and is available on both desktop computers and mobile devices running Android, Windows and iOS. The game layout is traditional, with five reels, three rows, ten fixed paylines and winnings obtained by aligning identical symbols on adjacent reels from left to right.\n\nThe Plus and Minus buttons, placed under the game grid, allow you to select the amount of your bet, ranging from a minimum of 10 cents to a maximum of €200 per spin, catering to all types of players. The declared theoretical return to player (RTP) for Book of Relics ranges from 94.36% to 96.36%.\n\nSymbols and features\nThe lowest value symbols are the numbers and letters that refer to playing cards, reproduced in Egyptian style, ranging from 10 to Ace in this case. To get more substantial winnings, you will have to hope that the thematic symbols appear on the reels, including a dagger, the deity with the bird head, the queen and the Pharaoh, which has the highest value, up to 5,000 times the bet amount when it appears on all five reels. The Wild of the game is the Book of Relics that gives the slot its title and, in addition to its function as a wild, it also acts as a scatter, allowing you to obtain a variable number of free spins, in which you can take advantage of some multipliers. The stacked symbols feature also increases the chances of winning, which is activated during free spins.\n        ",
