Questa volta, i capolavori Da Vinci Diamonds portano ai giocatori simboli giganti, moltiplicatori generosi e un premio impressionante del valore di 1000x la tua puntata.\nUna grafica artistica\nLa grafica di Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks è, lontano e lontano, molto meglio che nel gioco originale di Da Vinci Diamonds. Mentre il titolo originale era innovativo nella sua grafica, la versione Masterworks è solo molto più raffinata e bella.

Il gioco delle slot machine Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks celebra i suoi successi.\nSe avete familiarità con le opere di Leonardo Da Vinci, allora riconoscerete alcuni dei simboli. La Belle Ferronniere e la Gioconda sono tutti visti attraverso i cinque rulli della slot machine Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks. Anche se la qualità dell’arte non è all’altezza degli standard di Da Vinci stesso, i designer hanno fatto un bel tentativo di ricreare alcune delle sue opere più famose.\nAltri simboli includono rubini brillanti, smeraldi e diamanti. Tutti questi brillano sullo sfondo ornato e sulla cornice dorata che circonda le bobine. La nostra recensione della slot Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks ha scoperto che questo gioco ha una grafica eccezionale e tutto il nostro team è d’accordo sul fatto che è ancora più bello dell’originale. Ha anche una piacevole melodia che si svolge mentre le bobine girano.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nL’RTP (ritorno al giocatore) della Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks varia dal 92,55% al 96,37%. Questa percentuale di vincita permette ai giocatori di sapere quanti soldi possono come premio per ogni 100 euro che scommettono. Si tratta anche di un gioco a media varianza, il che significa che ci si può aspettare di guadagnare premi di modesta entità abbastanza spesso.\nPer vincere al Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks, dovete atterrare tre o più simboli corrispondenti sulla stessa linea di pagamento. Il primo premio disponibile è quello del simbolo del logo, che paga 1000 volte la vostra puntata. Proprio come nell’originale, ci sono i Tumbling Reels che permettono di ottenere più vittorie in un unico giro. Il simbolo Wild la aiuta a creare combinazioni vincenti sostituendo tutti gli altri simboli.\nCi sono simboli Giant Portrait disponibili nel gioco base, che aiutano ad aumentare le vostre probabilità di vincita. Se fanno parte di una combinazione vincente, al vostro premio viene applicato un moltiplicatore tra 1x e 4x.\nQuando atterrate tre simboli bonus, sarete in grado di innescare uno dei tre giri liberi:\n– Ritratto sparpagliato: sui rulli appaiono altri simboli Ritratto gigante\n– Moltiplicatori potenziati: sono disponibili più Ritratti giganti, con moltiplicatori più grandi fino a 6x che possono essere sommati\n– Giganteschi 2x Wilds: alle bobine vengono aggiunti altri Wilds e Ritratti giganti con moltiplicatori più generosi a disposizione\nSe otterrete più simboli bonus, potrete innescare più giri gratis. C’è anche la funzione Seconda Occasione. Dopo la fine del bonus round, avrete la possibilità di innescare da 1 a 6 giri gratis extra.\nIl gioco di slot Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks è dotato di bobine a cascata. Tutti i simboli che fanno parte di una vincita svaniranno, lasciando spazi vuoti in cui far cadere quelli soprastanti. Se questo crea una nuova combinazione vincente, il processo si ripete. Questo può andare avanti fino a quando non ci sono nuove vittorie in vista.\nAbbiamo scoperto che i simboli più preziosi nella fessura dei capolavori di Da Vinci Diamonds sono i ritratti. La Gioconda paga 25x la puntata totale quando riempie una linea di pagamento e il logo del gioco vale un enorme 125x.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nDa Vinci Diamonds Masterworks non è l’unica slot online basata su un grande artista.

All of these shimmer against the ornate backdrop and golden frame surrounding the reels. Our review of the Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot found that this game has exceptional graphics, and our entire team agrees that it's even more beautiful than the original. It also has a pleasant melody playing as the reels spin. \n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nThe RTP (return to player) of Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks ranges from 92.55% to 96.37%.

There's also the Second Chance feature. After the end of the bonus round, you'll have the chance to trigger from 1 to 6 extra free spins. \n\nThe Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot game features cascading reels. All symbols that are part of a win disappear, leaving empty spaces for the ones above to fall into. If this creates a new winning combination, the process repeats. This can go on until there are no more potential wins in sight. \n\nWe found that the most valuable symbols in the Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot are the portraits.

It also has a pleasant melody playing as the reels spin. \n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nThe RTP (return to player) of Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks ranges from 92.55% to 96.37%. This payout percentage allows players to know how much money they can win as a prize for every 100 euros they bet. It's also a medium variance game, meaning you can expect to win modest prizes fairly often. \n\nTo win at Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks, you must land three or more matching symbols on the same payline. The first available prize is that of the logo symbol, which pays 1000 times your bet. Just like in the original, there are Tumbling Reels that allow for multiple wins in a single spin. The Wild symbol helps create winning combinations by substituting for all other symbols. \n\nThere are Giant Portrait symbols available in the base game, which help increase your chances of winning. If they are part of a winning combination, your prize is multiplied by a factor of 1x to 4x. \n\nWhen you land three bonus symbols, you'll be able to trigger one of three free spins: \n\n- Scattered Portrait: giant Portrait symbols appear on the reels \n- Enhanced Multipliers: more giant Portraits are available, with larger multipliers up to 6x that can be added \n- 2x Gigantic Wilds: more Wilds and giant Portraits with more generous multipliers are added to the reels \n\nIf you get more bonus symbols, you can trigger more free spins. There's also the Second Chance feature. After the end of the bonus round, you'll have the chance to trigger from 1 to 6 extra free spins. \n\nThe Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot game features cascading reels. All symbols that are part of a win disappear, leaving empty spaces for the ones above to fall into. If this creates a new winning combination, the process repeats. This can go on until there are no more potential wins in sight. \n\nWe found that the most valuable symbols in the Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot are the portraits. La Gioconda pays 25x the total bet when filling a payline and the game logo is worth a huge 125x. \n\nOther similar slot machines\nDa Vinci Diamonds Masterworks isn't the only online slot based on a great artist. The slot Van Gogh from High 5 Games features a series of stunning paintings on five reels. It's another game with a cascading reel system, as well as a free spins feature and wild substitutions.\n            ",

You might get lost in its intricate designs and find yourself transported to a parallel universe where slot games are played with chess pieces and leprechauns.</p><p>But wait, there's more! The animations are not only beautiful but also entertaining. Some of them are downright hilarious. We won't spoil the surprise, but let's just say that you might see the Mona Lisa do something unexpected. We're not sure she'd be pleased, but who cares?

This time, the game features a ton of bonus features including wild multipliers and giant symbols to help you win the generous 1000x top prize. Just when you thought Da Vinci Diamonds couldn't get any better - IGT releases another sequel. This time, the Da Vinci Diamonds masterpieces bring players giant symbols, generous multipliers, and an impressive prize worth 1000x your bet. \n\nArtistic graphics\nThe graphics of Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks are far and away much better than the original Da Vinci Diamonds game. While the original title was innovative in its graphics, the Masterworks version is simply much more refined and beautiful. The jewels have a realistic look, while the paintings are very faithful to the original works they represent. There's also a nice theme of classical music playing in the background. \n\nIt is widely believed that Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest painters, inventors and sculptors of all time. The Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot machine game celebrates his successes. If you're familiar with the works of Leonardo Da Vinci, then you'll recognize some of the symbols. The Belle Ferronniere and La Gioconda are all seen across the five reels of the Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot machine. Although the quality of the art doesn't measure up to Da Vinci's own standards, the designers have made a nice attempt to recreate some of his most famous works. \n\nOther symbols include brilliant rubies, emeralds, and diamonds. All of these shimmer against the ornate backdrop and golden frame surrounding the reels. Our review of the Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot found that this game has exceptional graphics, and our entire team agrees that it's even more beautiful than the original. It also has a pleasant melody playing as the reels spin. \n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nThe RTP (return to player) of Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks ranges from 92.55% to 96.37%. This payout percentage allows players to know how much money they can win as a prize for every 100 euros they bet. It's also a medium variance game, meaning you can expect to win modest prizes fairly often. \n\nTo win at Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks, you must land three or more matching symbols on the same payline. The first available prize is that of the logo symbol, which pays 1000 times your bet. Just like in the original, there are Tumbling Reels that allow for multiple wins in a single spin. The Wild symbol helps create winning combinations by substituting for all other symbols. \n\nThere are Giant Portrait symbols available in the base game, which help increase your chances of winning. If they are part of a winning combination, your prize is multiplied by a factor of 1x to 4x. \n\nWhen you land three bonus symbols, you'll be able to trigger one of three free spins: \n\n- Scattered Portrait: giant Portrait symbols appear on the reels \n- Enhanced Multipliers: more giant Portraits are available, with larger multipliers up to 6x that can be added \n- 2x Gigantic Wilds: more Wilds and giant Portraits with more generous multipliers are added to the reels \n\nIf you get more bonus symbols, you can trigger more free spins. There's also the Second Chance feature. After the end of the bonus round, you'll have the chance to trigger from 1 to 6 extra free spins. \n\nThe Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot game features cascading reels. All symbols that are part of a win disappear, leaving empty spaces for the ones above to fall into. If this creates a new winning combination, the process repeats. This can go on until there are no more potential wins in sight. \n\nWe found that the most valuable symbols in the Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot are the portraits. La Gioconda pays 25x the total bet when filling a payline and the game logo is worth a huge 125x. \n\nOther similar slot machines\nDa Vinci Diamonds Masterworks isn't the only online slot based on a great artist. The slot Van Gogh from High 5 Games features a series of stunning paintings on five reels. It's another game with a cascading reel system, as well as a free spins feature and wild substitutions.\n            ",

There's also a nice theme of classical music playing in the background. \n\nIt is widely believed that Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest painters, inventors and sculptors of all time. The Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot machine game celebrates his successes. If you're familiar with the works of Leonardo Da Vinci, then you'll recognize some of the symbols. The Belle Ferronniere and La Gioconda are all seen across the five reels of the Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot machine. Although the quality of the art doesn't measure up to Da Vinci's own standards, the designers have made a nice attempt to recreate some of his most famous works. \n\nOther symbols include brilliant rubies, emeralds, and diamonds. All of these shimmer against the ornate backdrop and golden frame surrounding the reels. Our review of the Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot found that this game has exceptional graphics, and our entire team agrees that it's even more beautiful than the original. It also has a pleasant melody playing as the reels spin. \n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nThe RTP (return to player) of Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks ranges from 92.55% to 96.37%. This payout percentage allows players to know how much money they can win as a prize for every 100 euros they bet. It's also a medium variance game, meaning you can expect to win modest prizes fairly often. \n\nTo win at Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks, you must land three or more matching symbols on the same payline. The first available prize is that of the logo symbol, which pays 1000 times your bet. Just like in the original, there are Tumbling Reels that allow for multiple wins in a single spin. The Wild symbol helps create winning combinations by substituting for all other symbols. \n\nThere are Giant Portrait symbols available in the base game, which help increase your chances of winning. If they are part of a winning combination, your prize is multiplied by a factor of 1x to 4x. \n\nWhen you land three bonus symbols, you'll be able to trigger one of three free spins: \n\n- Scattered Portrait: giant Portrait symbols appear on the reels \n- Enhanced Multipliers: more giant Portraits are available, with larger multipliers up to 6x that can be added \n- 2x Gigantic Wilds: more Wilds and giant Portraits with more generous multipliers are added to the reels \n\nIf you get more bonus symbols, you can trigger more free spins. There's also the Second Chance feature. After the end of the bonus round, you'll have the chance to trigger from 1 to 6 extra free spins. \n\nThe Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot game features cascading reels. All symbols that are part of a win disappear, leaving empty spaces for the ones above to fall into. If this creates a new winning combination, the process repeats. This can go on until there are no more potential wins in sight. \n\nWe found that the most valuable symbols in the Da Vinci Diamonds Masterworks slot are the portraits. La Gioconda pays 25x the total bet when filling a payline and the game logo is worth a huge 125x. \n\nOther similar slot machines\nDa Vinci Diamonds Masterworks isn't the only online slot based on a great artist.
