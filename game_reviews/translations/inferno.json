The visuals are visually pleasing, with well-defined fruits and reproduced with very bright colors on the flaming background.\n\nGame Structure\n\nInferno's structure is minimal and classic: five reels, three rows, and five paylines. Bets start at 40 cents per spin. The Autoplay mode is available to spin the reels automatically. Novomatic also offers a demo version to play for free.\n\nGameplay Features\n\nInferno is a high-volatility slot machine with a not very exciting theoretical return to player percentage below average with 95%. The 'leave or double' function is automatically activated in case of any winning combination. A flipped card appears on the screen, and the player has to guess the color. If the bet is correct, the prize is doubled, otherwise, the player loses everything.\n\nPaylines and Symbols\n\nInferno's symbols are represented mostly by fruits - plums, oranges, grapes, lemons, and cherries - which all pay out with at least three symbols on an active payline, starting from left to right. Cherries are an exception as they determine a winning combination even if they appear only twice. The golden star is the highest paying symbol in Inferno, followed by the bell and the bunch of grapes. The Scatter symbol is a jewel-studded crown that pays out when it appears on the reels at least three times, regardless of the position it occupies.\n\nReturn to Player Percentage\n\nInferno has a theoretical return to player percentage of 95%, which is below average. Its high volatility adds excitement to gameplay. \n\n        \n            ",

Well, we were immediately proven wrong! Inferno, a slot machine produced by the software house Novomatic, is nothing like that! In reality, it is a full-fledged Fruit Machine, with traditional colorful fruits that alternate on the reels and with a bell equipped with horns and a fiery background that are the only ties to the word inferno!\n\nThe Fruit Machine, despite being the first slots ever produced, can be said to have never gone out of style, constantly carving out a place in the market and the hearts of many enthusiasts, who continue to prefer the tradition of fruits and bells to hyper-technological new games!\n\nAs for the graphic department of Inferno, there isn't much to say, except that overall, the slot is visually very pleasing, with well-defined fruits and reproduced with very bright colors on a flaming background. In short, if you were looking for action and epic characters, you're in the wrong place, but if you like vintage and traditional slots where gameplay is king, then you're in the right place!\n\nKey Features of the Slot\nInferno is simply a slot machine that is suitable for everyone! Furthermore, Novomatic also offers a demo version so you can play for free until you understand exactly how it works and are ready to invest real money!\n\nThe structure of Inferno is super classic and minimal: five reels, three rows, and five paylines, on which you can place your bets starting at just 40 cents per spin. Once you have set the value of the bet, you can comfortably start the Autoplay mode and let the reels spin automatically.\n\nInferno is a high-volatility slot machine, but it has a not very exciting theoretical return to player percentage, a bit below average with its 95%.\n\nSymbols and Features of Inferno\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Inferno are mostly represented by fruits: we have plums, oranges, grapes, lemons, and cherries, which all pay out in case of an alignment of at least three symbols on an active payline, starting from left to right. Cherries are an exception as they determine a winning combination even if they appear only twice. The golden star is the highest paying symbol in Inferno, followed by the bell and the bunch of grapes.\n\nThe Scatter symbol of Inferno is a jewel-studded crown, which pays out when it appears on the reels at least three times, regardless of the position it occupies.\n\nIn case of any winning combination, an \"leave or double\" function is automatically activated: a flipped card appears on the screen, and you have to guess the color. If the bet is correct, the prize is doubled, otherwise, you lose everything.\n            ",
