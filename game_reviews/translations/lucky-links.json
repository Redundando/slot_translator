It is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot that can be played from 10 cents to €250 per spin on all devices. It comes with a Lucky Links feature where linked symbol stacks lock in place with subsequent respins. Wins pay both ways, from left to right and right to left, starting from the outermost reel (reels 1 or 5).\n\nWhen you get bored with your current fruit slot and decide that you want something new and exciting, you can always count on us to point you in the right direction. One of the latest modern releases that has hit online casinos recently is Just For the Win's Lucky Links, an online slot that is receiving enthusiastic reviews thanks to its innovative link-locking feature on its reels.\n\nContaining 5 reels and 25 paylines, this low-variance slot is already renowned for its extremely regular payouts. Everything is fast and furious, as the reels are distributed over many spins as part of its excellent feature that also allows for win both ways. Read the rest of our review to learn more about the fantastic free online slot game Lucky Links.\n\nA traditional but not too traditional graphics design\n\nVisually, the game is predominantly purple – with a touch of luck, inspired by the glittering light shows of Fremont Street casinos. The symbols on the reels include hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades, alongside good luck symbols such as four-leaf clovers, horse shoes, acorns, and triple red sevens. There is also a Lucky Links logo symbol that gives you 7.5 times your bet for 5 on a payline.\n\nLucky Links is a mobile-optimized slot, so no download is required to play the game, which is already a big advantage. When you load it up, you'll see another big advantage, as the graphics and animations are top-notch. Considering the frenetic action of the video slot Lucky Links, it can sometimes be surprising how smoothly everything works.\n\nSure, there are no special symbols on the reels other than the game logo (which we'll talk more about later), but once you try a few spins in this slot, you'll realize that they're not really necessary. The symbols on the reels are the flowers, diamonds, spades, and hearts of playing cards. They represent low-cost symbols, while the high-cost symbols are all unique symbols such as four-leaf clovers, acorns, and triple 7s.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nPlayers can bet anything from a minimum bet of €0.10 up to a maximum bet of €250.00 on this fabulous online slot game. This is a range of bets that will satisfy most casual players or someone who might be classified as a high-roller in online casinos.\n\nRegarding the features of the online slot Lucky Links, there aren't really many besides its excellent feature of link-locking on the game's base reels. There is one that requires five of the game's logos to land on an active payline and if you manage to do so, you will be given a wonderful payout of seven and a half times your total bet.\n\nRegarding the main feature of this online slot, it is the winning combinations that form on your reels. Every time you get sequences of the same symbols, they will lock in place. You will then be given respins for any reel that is not involved in this interlocking. This gives you the opportunity to link more of the same symbols and when you do, you will get additional respins for any other empty reel.\n\nThe game features a Lucky Links feature that is played when the linking symbol stacks line up horizontally – the volume increases as more instruments join and the lights go wild. Then they lock in place with subsequent respins. If more linking symbols land, the respins continue.\n\nThe Lucky Links feature is triggered frequently because it is a low-variance offer – it offers wins up to 352 times your bet on each spin, which is not bad at all.\n\nWe can never get enough of Just For the Win's Lucky Links because it really offers a fun and complete online gaming experience. With a low variance, you already know that you can bet on regular but not disproportionate wins, so the game is always lively and never static. All this is surrounded by fantastic graphics and smooth animations that will effortlessly fill the screen.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nIf you're looking for something a little different than Lucky Links for any reason (we can't think of many you might have), we have many other slots to share with you. Just two of these would be Reel Baron and Rhyming Reels Jack & Jill, both by Microgaming.\n\nReel Baron will give you an RTP of 95.81%, give you an average variance to play with, and also some features like free spins with multipliers, wild symbols, and a bonus game. This slot uses a traditional combination of 5-reels and 20-paylines and will give you more excitement in online casinos than you can ever imagine.",

                            "content": "Just For the Win and Microgaming have created Lucky Links, a 5-reel, 20-payline slot game that can be played from 10 cents to €250 per spin on all devices. It comes with a Lucky Links feature where stacks of linking symbols lock in place with re-spins to follow. With wins paying out both ways, you can form winning combinations from left to right and from right to left starting from the outermost reel (reel 1 or 5).\n\nIf you're looking for something new and exciting to break the monotony of your current fruit slot, Lucky Links by Just For the Win is a modern release that is gaining enthusiastic reviews thanks to its innovative linking and locking feature. This low variance slot game with 5 reels and 25 paylines is already renowned for its extremely regular payouts.\n\nThe game is predominantly purple with a touch of luck inspired by the glittering lights of Fremont Street in casinos. Symbols on the reels include hearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades as well as lucky symbols like four-leaf clovers, horseshoes, acorns, and triple red 7s. There is also a Lucky Links logo symbol that gives you 7.5 times your bet for 5 on a payline.\n\nLucky Links is optimized for mobile devices so there is no download required to play the game. Once loaded, enjoy the smooth and high-quality graphics and animations. Although there are no special symbols on the reels besides the game logo (which we'll talk about later), when you spin in this slot you'll realize that they are not really necessary. Symbols on the reels are flowers, diamonds, spades, clubs, etc. representing low-cost symbols, while high-paying symbols are all unique symbols such as four-leaf clovers, acorns, and triple 7s.\n\nPlayers can bet anything from a minimum bet of 0.10 euros up to a maximum bet of 250.00 euros on this fabulous online slot machine. This range of bets will satisfy most casual players or anyone who might be classified as a high-roller in online casinos.\n\nWith only its excellent Link-Locking feature on the game's reels, Lucky Links doesn't have many features. However, there is one that requires five of the game logos to be on an active payline and if you manage to do that, you'll receive a wonderful payout of seven and a half times your total bet.\n\nRegarding the main feature of this online slot, it's the winning combinations that form on your reels. Every time you get sequences of the same symbols, they lock in place and you're given re-spins for any reel that is not involved in this interlocking. This gives you the chance to link more of the same symbols and when you do, you receive additional re-spins for any other empty reel.\n\nThe game has a Lucky Links feature that is activated when the linking symbol stacks are aligned horizontally - the volume increases as more instruments join in and the lights go wild. Then they lock in place with successive re-spins. If more linking symbols land, the re-spins continue. The Lucky Links feature is often activated because it's a low variance offering that offers wins of up to 352 times your bet on every spin, which is not bad.\n\nWe can never get enough of Lucky Links by Just For the Win because it really offers a fun and complete online gaming experience. With a low variance, you already know that you can bet on regular but not disproportionate wins, so the game is always lively and never static. All of this is surrounded by fantastic graphics and smooth animations that will effortlessly fill your screen.\n\nIf you're looking for something a little different from Lucky Links for any reason (we can't think of many), we have many other slots to share with you. Just two of them are Reel Baron and Rhyming Reels Jack & Jill, both by Microgaming. Reel Baron will give you an RTP of 95.81% and a medium variance to play with, as well as some features like free spins with multipliers, wild symbols, and a bonus game. This slot uses a traditional combination of 5-reel reels and 20 paylines and will give you more excitement than any online casino."

Considering the frenetic action of the video slot Lucky Links, it can sometimes be surprising how smoothly everything works.\n\nSure, there are no special symbols on the reels other than the game logo (which we'll talk more about later), but once you try a few spins in this slot, you'll realize that they're not really necessary. The symbols on the reels are the flowers, diamonds, spades, and hearts of playing cards. They represent low-cost symbols, while the high-cost symbols are all unique symbols such as four-leaf clovers, acorns, and triple 7s.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nPlayers can bet anything from a minimum bet of €0.10 up to a maximum bet of €250.00 on this fabulous online slot game. This is a range of bets that will satisfy most casual players or someone who might be classified as a high-roller in online casinos.\n\nRegarding the features of the online slot Lucky Links, there aren't really many besides its excellent feature of link-locking on the game's base reels. There is one that requires five of the game's logos to land on an active payline and if you manage to do so, you will be given a wonderful payout of seven and a half times your total bet.\n\nRegarding the main feature of this online slot, it is the winning combinations that form on your reels. Every time you get sequences of the same symbols, they will lock in place. You will then be given respins for any reel that is not involved in this interlocking. This gives you the opportunity to link more of the same symbols and when you do, you will get additional respins for any other empty reel.\n\nThe game features a Lucky Links feature that is played when the linking symbol stacks line up horizontally – the volume increases as more instruments join and the lights go wild. Then they lock in place with subsequent respins. If more linking symbols land, the respins continue.\n\nThe Lucky Links feature is triggered frequently because it is a low-variance offer – it offers wins up to 352 times your bet on each spin, which is not bad at all.\n\nWe can never get enough of Just For the Win's Lucky Links because it really offers a fun and complete online gaming experience. With a low variance, you already know that you can bet on regular but not disproportionate wins, so the game is always lively and never static. All this is surrounded by fantastic graphics and smooth animations that will effortlessly fill the screen.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nIf you're looking for something a little different than Lucky Links for any reason (we can't think of many you might have), we have many other slots to share with you. Just two of these would be Reel Baron and Rhyming Reels Jack & Jill, both by Microgaming.\n\nReel Baron will give you an RTP of 95.81%, give you an average variance to play with, and also some features like free spins with multipliers, wild symbols, and a bonus game. This slot uses a traditional combination of 5-reels and 20-paylines and will give you more excitement in online casinos than you can ever imagine.\n            ",

It is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot that can be played from 10 cents to €250 per spin on all devices. It comes with a Lucky Links feature where linked symbol stacks lock in place with subsequent respins. Wins pay both ways, from left to right and right to left, starting from the outermost reel (reels 1 or 5).\n\nWhen you get bored with your current fruit slot and decide that you want something new and exciting, you can always count on us to point you in the right direction. One of the latest modern releases that has hit online casinos recently is Just For the Win's Lucky Links, an online slot that is receiving enthusiastic reviews thanks to its innovative link-locking feature on its reels.\n\nContaining 5 reels and 25 paylines, this low-variance slot is already renowned for its extremely regular payouts. Everything is fast and furious, as the reels are distributed over many spins as part of its excellent feature that also allows for win both ways. Read the rest of our review to learn more about the fantastic free online slot game Lucky Links.\n\nA traditional but not too traditional graphics design\n\nVisually, the game is predominantly purple – with a touch of luck, inspired by the glittering light shows of Fremont Street casinos. The symbols on the reels include hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades, alongside good luck symbols such as four-leaf clovers, horse shoes, acorns, and triple red sevens. There is also a Lucky Links logo symbol that gives you 7.5 times your bet for 5 on a payline.\n\nLucky Links is a mobile-optimized slot, so no download is required to play the game, which is already a big advantage. When you load it up, you'll see another big advantage, as the graphics and animations are top-notch. Considering the frenetic action of the video slot Lucky Links, it can sometimes be surprising how smoothly everything works.\n\nSure, there are no special symbols on the reels other than the game logo (which we'll talk more about later), but once you try a few spins in this slot, you'll realize that they're not really necessary. The symbols on the reels are the flowers, diamonds, spades, and hearts of playing cards. They represent low-cost symbols, while the high-cost symbols are all unique symbols such as four-leaf clovers, acorns, and triple 7s.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nPlayers can bet anything from a minimum bet of €0.10 up to a maximum bet of €250.00 on this fabulous online slot game. This is a range of bets that will satisfy most casual players or someone who might be classified as a high-roller in online casinos.\n\nRegarding the features of the online slot Lucky Links, there aren't really many besides its excellent feature of link-locking on the game's base reels. There is one that requires five of the game's logos to land on an active payline and if you manage to do so, you will be given a wonderful payout of seven and a half times your total bet.\n\nRegarding the main feature of this online slot, it is the winning combinations that form on your reels. Every time you get sequences of the same symbols, they will lock in place. You will then be given respins for any reel that is not involved in this interlocking. This gives you the opportunity to link more of the same symbols and when you do, you will get additional respins for any other empty reel.\n\nThe game features a Lucky Links feature that is played when the linking symbol stacks line up horizontally – the volume increases as more instruments join and the lights go wild. Then they lock in place with subsequent respins. If more linking symbols land, the respins continue.\n\nThe Lucky Links feature is triggered frequently because it is a low-variance offer – it offers wins up to 352 times your bet on each spin, which is not bad at all.\n\nWe can never get enough of Just For the Win's Lucky Links because it really offers a fun and complete online gaming experience. With a low variance, you already know that you can bet on regular but not disproportionate wins, so the game is always lively and never static. All this is surrounded by fantastic graphics and smooth animations that will effortlessly fill the screen.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nIf you're looking for something a little different than Lucky Links for any reason (we can't think of many you might have), we have many other slots to share with you. Just two of these would be Reel Baron and Rhyming Reels Jack & Jill, both by Microgaming.\n\nReel Baron will give you an RTP of 95.81%, give you an average variance to play with, and also some features like free spins with multipliers, wild symbols, and a bonus game. This slot uses a traditional combination of 5-reels and 20-paylines and will give you more excitement in online casinos than you can ever imagine.\n            ",

It is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot that can be played from 10 cents to €250 per spin on all devices. It comes with a Lucky Links feature where linked symbol stacks lock in place with subsequent respins. Wins pay both ways, from left to right and right to left, starting from the outermost reel (reels 1 or 5).\n\nWhen you get bored with your current fruit slot and decide that you want something new and exciting, you can always count on us to point you in the right direction. One of the latest modern releases that has hit online casinos recently is Just For the Win's Lucky Links, an online slot that is receiving enthusiastic reviews thanks to its innovative link-locking feature on its reels.\n\nContaining 5 reels and 25 paylines, this low-variance slot is already renowned for its extremely regular payouts. Everything is fast and furious, as the reels are distributed over many spins as part of its excellent feature that also allows for win both ways. Read the rest of our review to learn more about the fantastic free online slot game Lucky Links.\n\nA traditional but not too traditional graphics design\n\nVisually, the game is predominantly purple – with a touch of luck, inspired by the glittering light shows of Fremont Street casinos. The symbols on the reels include hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades, alongside good luck symbols such as four-leaf clovers, horse shoes, acorns, and triple red sevens. There is also a Lucky Links logo symbol that gives you 7.5 times your bet for 5 on a payline.\n\nLucky Links is a mobile-optimized slot, so no download is required to play the game, which is already a big advantage. When you load it up, you'll see another big advantage, as the graphics and animations are top-notch. Considering the frenetic action of the video slot Lucky Links, it can sometimes be surprising how smoothly everything works.\n\nSure, there are no special symbols on the reels other than the game logo (which we'll talk more about later), but once you try a few spins in this slot, you'll realize that they're not really necessary. The symbols on the reels are the flowers, diamonds, spades, and hearts of playing cards. They represent low-cost symbols, while the high-cost symbols are all unique symbols such as four-leaf clovers, acorns, and triple 7s.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nPlayers can bet anything from a minimum bet of €0.10 up to a maximum bet of €250.00 on this fabulous online slot game. This is a range of bets that will satisfy most casual players or someone who might be classified as a high-roller in online casinos.\n\nRegarding the features of the online slot Lucky Links, there aren't really many besides its excellent feature of link-locking on the game's base reels. There is one that requires five of the game's logos to land on an active payline and if you manage to do so, you will be given a wonderful payout of seven and a half times your total bet.\n\nRegarding the main feature of this online slot, it is the winning combinations that form on your reels. Every time you get sequences of the same symbols, they will lock in place. You will then be given respins for any reel that is not involved in this interlocking. This gives you the opportunity to link more of the same symbols and when you do, you will get additional respins for any other empty reel.\n\nThe game features a Lucky Links feature that is played when the linking symbol stacks line up horizontally – the volume increases as more instruments join and the lights go wild. Then they lock in place with subsequent respins. If more linking symbols land, the respins continue.\n\nThe Lucky Links feature is triggered frequently because it is a low-variance offer – it offers wins up to 352 times your bet on each spin, which is not bad at all.\n\nWe can never get enough of Just For the Win's Lucky Links because it really offers a fun and complete online gaming experience. With a low variance, you already know that you can bet on regular but not disproportionate wins, so the game is always lively and never static. All this is surrounded by fantastic graphics and smooth animations that will effortlessly fill the screen.\n\nOther similar slot machines\n\nIf you're looking for something a little different than Lucky Links for any reason (we can't think of many you might have), we have many other slots to share with you. Just two of these would be Reel Baron and Rhyming Reels Jack & Jill, both by Microgaming.\n\nReel Baron will give you an RTP of 95.81%, give you an average variance to play with, and also some features like free spins with multipliers, wild symbols, and a bonus game.
