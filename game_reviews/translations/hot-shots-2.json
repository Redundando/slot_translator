This slot's main features include 243 ways to win on five reels, which can lead to a free spins bonus with wild cloning and multipliers. A buy feature is also available that can lead to a maximum payout of 1000x multiplied by your winning bet.\n\nThe international animal soccer team from iSoftBet is back for another tournament in Hot Shots 2. Played on a 5-reel, 243 ways to win game engine, it features a bonus round where you can win up to 40 free spins. Look for special wilds that can spread horizontally and vertically when they land on reels 3, 4, or 5. Additionally, during the mini-game provided by Free Spins, these multipliers provide even bigger rewards.\n\nIn our Hot Shots 2 review, you'll also discover the Ultra Bet Mode. Collect stars during this set of 50 spins to win bonus prizes up to 1000x your bet. Referee, blow the starting whistle!\n\nA sporty graphic\nFrom a design standpoint, we can confidently say that this is an eccentric slot to review. As we mentioned, football stars are wild animals that represent the national teams of England, Spain, France, and probably the Fox represents Portugal if not Italy.\n\nThere are enough moving parts in the game to create an engaging dynamic. We have soccer balls as Wild symbols and there's a chance to get a golden one. The low-paying symbols are the set of Poker cards, namely 9, 10, J, Q, K, and Ace.\n\nHot Shots 2 slot marks big wins with a storm of coins pouring from the bottom, and the wild cloning feature allows you to win much more than you would in a normal slot.\n\nIf you've played the original Hot Shots slot, you'll find a lot of familiar things in this sequel. The setting is a clearing in a forest where cartoon animals host a soccer tournament.\n\nThe cartoon symbols are well-drawn and give the slot a lighthearted feel. You'll hear the roar of the crowd and all the other animals participating in the sports tournament.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nTo win in the game, lucky players would need more than three matching symbols. However, wins start on the leftmost reel and can occur on any row, because Hot Shots 2 offers 243 paylines, so forget those 10 paylines you're used to in other slot machines.\n\nIn terms of values, the most paying symbol of the standard symbols is the German Shepherd, with 10x multiplied by the winning bet finding the same symbol five times. The rest of the symbols on the Hot Shots 2 slot offer much smaller amounts.\n\nFortunately, there's the wild symbol, which is represented by the ball and can appear on reels three, four, and five.\n\nThe game comes with a free spins bonus, multipliers, wild cloning, golden wild, and more. Free spins are activated by the scatter symbol, which is the game logo, stopping in three, four, or five spots. The result is 10, 15, or 20 free spins in that order.\n\nThe golden wild we talked about is only available in this bonus feature, but has the ability to clone in any way.\n\nHot Shots 2 features a buy feature that is a rather expensive way to get 50 spins.\n\nThe action in Hot Shots 2 takes place on a 5-reel, 243 ways to win machine where winning combinations are formed by landing 3 or more matching symbols on adjacent reels, starting on reel 1. Players with a rather low payroll (i.e. initial budget) can play starting at 25 cents per spin. If you have a higher budget, you can click on the coin symbol on the right of the reels and adjust your bet accordingly.\n\nClick on the arrows attached above the spin button for autoplay. You can set between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins, complete with win and loss limits. You can also play in turbo mode. Click on the lightning bolt button in the bottom left corner of the screen to put it into play.\n\nThe RTP for Hot Shots 2 is 96%. In Ultra Bet mode, the standard play is 91.5%, but you also have to consider the 5% for the stars, which brings the Return to Player to a peak of 96.5%.\n\nThe maximum payout is 2,430x your bet per spin. You can win if you fill the reels with the high-value German Shepherd symbol. Added to the multipliers and Free Spins feature, the maximum win you can get from a single spin is at a 12,150x multiplier.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nIn the UK, it's a true authority on national football, which is why we recommend trying Celtic Football Club slot machine where you will play as this Celtic football team and offers you 20 always active paylines and five reels. The game has an RTP of 95.27% and engaging reel action that includes a free spins bonus that includes the chance to score a goal and get a kicker on your winnings. The top-paying symbol brings 1000x and the initial bet is just 0.20 euros per spin.",

Tuttavia, le vittorie iniziano sulla bobina più a sinistra e possono verificarsi su qualsiasi riga, perché Hot Shots 2 offre 243 paylines, quindi dimentica quelle 10 linee di pagamento a cui sei abituato nelle altre Slot Machine.\nIn termini di valori, il simbolo più pagante dei simboli standard è il pastore tedesco, con 10x moltiplicato per la scommessa vincente trovando cinque volte lo stesso simbolo. Il resto dei simboli sulla slot Hot Shots 2 offre importi molto più piccoli.\nPer fortuna, c’è il simbolo jolly che è rappresentato dal pallone e che può apparire sui rulli tre, quattro e cinque.\nIl gioco viene fornito con un bonus di giri gratis, moltiplicatori, clonazione di wild, golden wild e altro ancora. I giri gratis sono attivati dal simbolo scatter, che è il logo del gioco, che si ferma in tre, quattro o cinque punti. Il risultato è 10, 15 o 20 giri gratis in quest’ordine.\nIl wild dorato di cui abbiamo parlato si rende disponibile solo in questa funzione bonus, ma ha la possibilità di clonarsi in qualsiasi modo.\nHot Shots 2 porta una funzione di acquisto che è un modo piuttosto costoso per ottenere 50 giri.\nL’azione in Hot Shots 2 si svolge su una macchina a 5 rulli, 243 modi per vincere dove le combinazioni vincenti sono formate atterrando 3 o più simboli corrispondenti su rulli adiacenti, a partire dal rullo 1. I giocatori che hanno un payroll (ossia un budget iniziale) piuttosto basso, possono giocare a partire da 25 centesimi per giro. Se invece hai un budget più alto puoi cliccare sul simbolo della moneta a destra dei rulli e regolare di conseguenza la tua puntata.\nClicca sulle frecce collegate sopra il pulsante di rotazione per l’autoplay. È possibile impostare tra 5 e 1.000 giri automatici, completi di limiti di vincita e perdita. Si può anche giocare in modalità turbo. Cliccate sul pulsante del fulmine nell’angolo in basso a sinistra dello schermo per metterlo in gioco.\nL’RTP per Hot Shots 2 è del 96%. In modalità Ultra Bet, la giocata standard è del 91,5%, ma bisogna anche considerare il 5% per le stelle, che porta il Return to Player a toccare una vetta del 96,5%.\nIl payout massimo è di 2.430x volte la vostra puntata per spin. Si può vincere se si riempiono i rulli con il simbolo del cane tedesco di alto valore. Aggiunti i moltiplicatori e la funzione Free Spins, la vincita massima che puoi ottenere da un singolo spin si attesta sul moltiplicatore 12.150x.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nNel Regno Unito si tratta di una vera autorità nel campo del calcio nazionale, per questo ti consigliamo di provare Celtic Football Club la Slot Machine in cui vestirai i panni di questa squadra di football celtica e che ti offre 20 linee di pagamento sempre attive e cinque rulli. Il gioco ha un RTP del 95,27% e un’azione di bobina coinvolgente che include un bonus di giri gratis che include la possibilità di segnare un gol e ottenere un kicker sulle tue vincite. Il simbolo di pagamento in alto porta 1000x e la scommessa iniziale è di appena 0,20 euro per giro.\n\n        ",

The highlights of this slot are the 243 ways to win on five reels, which can lead to a free spins bonus with wild cloning and multipliers. There's also a buy feature that can lead to a maximum payout of 1000x multiplied by the winning bet.\n\nThe international animal soccer team from iSoftBet is back for another tournament in the Hot Shots 2 slot. Played with a 5-reel, 243 ways to win game engine, it features a bonus round where you can win up to 40 free spins. Look out for special wilds that can spread horizontally and vertically when they land on reels 3, 4, or 5. Plus, during the Free Spins mini-game, these multipliers provide even more substantial rewards.\n\nIn our Hot Shots 2 review, you'll also discover the Ultra Bet Mode. Collect stars during this set of 50 spins to win bonus prizes of up to 1,000x your bet. Referee, can you blow the whistle to start the soccer match!\n\nA Sporty Design\nFrom a design perspective, we can safely say that this is an extravagant slot to review. As we said, the soccer stars are wild animals representing the national teams of England, Spain, France, and probably the Fox representing Portugal if not Italy.\n\nThere are enough moving parts in the game to create an engaging dynamic. We have soccer balls as wild symbols and there's a chance to get a golden one. The low paying symbols are the set of Poker cards, i.e., 9, 10, J, Q, K, and Ace.\n\nHot Shots 2 slot marks big wins with a storm of coins that gush out from the bottom and the wild cloning feature allows you to win much more than you would in a normal slot.\n\nIf you've played the original Hot Shots slot, you'll find a lot of familiar things in this sequel. The setting is a clearing in a forest where cartoon animals are hosting a soccer tournament.\n\nThe cartoon symbols are well-drawn and give the slot a lightweight feel. You'll hear the roar of the crowd and all the other animals participating in the athletic tournament.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nTo win in the game, lucky players would need more than three matching symbols. However, wins start on the leftmost reel and can occur on any line, because Hot Shots 2 offers 243 paylines, so forget about those 10 paylines you are used to on other slot machines.\n\nIn terms of values, the highest paying symbol of the standard symbols is the German shepherd, with 10x multiplied by the winning bet finding the same symbol five times. The rest of the symbols on the Hot Shots 2 slot offer much smaller amounts.\n\nLuckily, there's a wild symbol that is represented by the ball and can appear on reels three, four, and five.\n\nThe game comes with a free spins bonus, multipliers, wild cloning, golden wilds, and much more. Free spins are activated by the scatter symbol, which is the game logo, which stops at three, four, or five points. The result is 10, 15, or 20 free spins in that order.\n\nThe golden wild we talked about is only available in this bonus feature, but it has the ability to clone in any way.\n\nHot Shots 2 brings a buy feature that is a rather expensive way to get 50 spins.\n\nThe action in Hot Shots 2 takes place on a 5-reel, 243 ways to win machine where winning combinations are formed by landing 3 or more matching symbols on adjacent reels, starting from reel 1. Players who have a rather low payroll (i.e., initial budget) can play from 25 cents per spin. If you have a higher budget, you can click on the coin symbol to the right of the reels and adjust your bet accordingly.\n\nClick on the arrows linked above the rotation button for autoplay. You can set between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins, complete with win and loss limits. You can also play in turbo mode. Click on the lightning button in the bottom left corner of the screen to get it into play.\n\nThe RTP for Hot Shots 2 is 96%. In Ultra Bet mode, the standard play is 91.5%, but you also have to consider the 5% for stars, which brings the return to player to a peak of 96.5%.\n\nThe maximum payout is 2,430x your bet per spin. You can win if you fill the reels with the high-value German shepherd symbol. Added multipliers and the Free Spins feature, the maximum win you can get from a single spin is at 12,150x multiplier.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIn the UK, football is a true national authority, which is why we recommend trying the Celtic Football Club slot machine, where you will play as this Celtic football team and it offers 20 always-active paylines and five reels. The game has an RTP of 95.27% and engaging reel action that includes a free spins bonus that includes the chance to score a goal and get a kicker on your winnings. The highest paying symbol brings 1000x and the initial bet is just €0.20 per spin."

The highlights of this slot are the 243 ways to win on five reels, which can lead to a free spins bonus with wild cloning and multipliers. There's also a buy feature that can lead to a maximum payout of 1000x multiplied by the winning bet.\n\nThe international animal soccer team from iSoftBet is back for another tournament in the Hot Shots 2 slot. Played with a 5-reel, 243 ways to win game engine, it features a bonus round where you can win up to 40 free spins. Look out for special wilds that can spread horizontally and vertically when they land on reels 3, 4, or 5. Plus, during the Free Spins mini-game, these multipliers provide even more substantial rewards.\n\nIn our Hot Shots 2 review, you'll also discover the Ultra Bet Mode. Collect stars during this set of 50 spins to win bonus prizes of up to 1,000x your bet. Referee, can you blow the whistle to start the soccer match!\n\nA Sporty Design\nFrom a design perspective, we can safely say that this is an extravagant slot to review. As we said, the soccer stars are wild animals representing the national teams of England, Spain, France, and probably the Fox representing Portugal if not Italy.\n\nThere are enough moving parts in the game to create an engaging dynamic. We have soccer balls as wild symbols and there's a chance to get a golden one. The low paying symbols are the set of Poker cards, i.e., 9, 10, J, Q, K, and Ace.\n\nHot Shots 2 slot marks big wins with a storm of coins that gush out from the bottom and the wild cloning feature allows you to win much more than you would in a normal slot.\n\nIf you've played the original Hot Shots slot, you'll find a lot of familiar things in this sequel. The setting is a clearing in a forest where cartoon animals are hosting a soccer tournament.\n\nThe cartoon symbols are well-drawn and give the slot a lightweight feel. You'll hear the roar of the crowd and all the other animals participating in the athletic tournament.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nTo win in the game, lucky players would need more than three matching symbols. However, wins start on the leftmost reel and can occur on any line, because Hot Shots 2 offers 243 paylines, so forget about those 10 paylines you are used to on other slot machines.\n\nIn terms of values, the highest paying symbol of the standard symbols is the German shepherd, with 10x multiplied by the winning bet finding the same symbol five times. The rest of the symbols on the Hot Shots 2 slot offer much smaller amounts.\n\nLuckily, there's a wild symbol that is represented by the ball and can appear on reels three, four, and five.\n\nThe game comes with a free spins bonus, multipliers, wild cloning, golden wilds, and much more. Free spins are activated by the scatter symbol, which is the game logo, which stops at three, four, or five points. The result is 10, 15, or 20 free spins in that order.\n\nThe golden wild we talked about is only available in this bonus feature, but it has the ability to clone in any way.\n\nHot Shots 2 brings a buy feature that is a rather expensive way to get 50 spins.\n\nThe action in Hot Shots 2 takes place on a 5-reel, 243 ways to win machine where winning combinations are formed by landing 3 or more matching symbols on adjacent reels, starting from reel 1. Players who have a rather low payroll (i.e., initial budget) can play from 25 cents per spin. If you have a higher budget, you can click on the coin symbol to the right of the reels and adjust your bet accordingly.\n\nClick on the arrows linked above the rotation button for autoplay. You can set between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins, complete with win and loss limits. You can also play in turbo mode. Click on the lightning button in the bottom left corner of the screen to get it into play.\n\nThe RTP for Hot Shots 2 is 96%. In Ultra Bet mode, the standard play is 91.5%, but you also have to consider the 5% for stars, which brings the return to player to a peak of 96.5%.\n\nThe maximum payout is 2,430x your bet per spin. You can win if you fill the reels with the high-value German shepherd symbol. Added multipliers and the Free Spins feature, the maximum win you can get from a single spin is at 12,150x multiplier.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIn the UK, football is a true national authority, which is why we recommend trying the Celtic Football Club slot machine, where you will play as this Celtic football team and it offers 20 always-active paylines and five reels. The game has an RTP of 95.27% and engaging reel action that includes a free spins bonus that includes the chance to score a goal and get a kicker on your winnings. The highest paying symbol brings 1000x and the initial bet is just €0.20 per spin.\n            ",

There are enough moving parts in the game to create an engaging dynamic. Lucky players would need more than three matching symbols to win in the game. The highest paying symbol of the standard symbols is the German shepherd, with 10x multiplied by the winning bet finding the same symbol five times. The game comes with a free spins bonus, multipliers, wild cloning, golden wilds, and much more. Free spins are activated by the scatter symbol that stops at three, four, or five points. The result is 10, 15, or 20 free spins in that order. The golden wild is only available in this bonus feature, but it has the ability to clone in any way.\n\nDesign and Theme\n\nHot Shots 2 features a sporty design where the soccer stars are wild animals representing the national teams of England, Spain, France, and probably the Fox representing Portugal if not Italy. The cartoon symbols are well-drawn and give the slot a lightweight feel. You'll hear the roar of the crowd and all the other animals participating in the athletic tournament. The game marks big wins with a storm of coins that gush out from the bottom, and the wild cloning feature allows players to win much more than they would in a normal slot.\n\nBonus Rounds\n\nHot Shots 2 offers a free spins bonus that is activated by the scatter symbol, which is the game logo, that stops at three, four, or five points. The result is 10, 15, or 20 free spins in that order. The golden wild is only available in this bonus feature, but it has the ability to clone in any way. There's also a buy feature that is a rather expensive way to get 50 spins. Moreover,  during the Free Spins mini-game, multipliers provide even more substantial rewards.\n\nBuy Feature\n\nHot Shots 2 features a buy feature that is a rather expensive way to get 50 spins.\n\nSymbol Payouts\n\nHot Shots 2 has the standard symbols, which are the set of Poker cards, i.e., 9, 10, J, Q, K, and Ace, that pay much smaller amounts. The highest paying symbol of the standard symbols is the German shepherd, with 10x multiplied by the winning bet finding the same symbol five times. There's also a wild symbol that is represented by the ball and can appear on reels three, four, and five.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nThe RTP for Hot Shots 2 is 96%. In Ultra Bet mode, the standard play is 91.5%, but you also have to consider the 5% for stars, which brings the return to player to a peak of 96.5%. The maximum payout is 2,430x your bet per spin. The game has a medium level of volatility that means that players can expect to get steady payouts, but they may not be of great magnitude.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nIn the UK, football is a true national authority, which is why we recommend trying the Celtic Football Club slot machine, where you will play as this Celtic football team, and it offers 20 always-active paylines and five reels. The game has an RTP of 95.27% and engaging reel action that includes a free spins bonus that includes the chance to score a goal and get a kicker on your winnings. The highest paying symbol brings 1000x and the initial bet is just €0.20 per spin.\n\n        \n            ",

The highlights of this slot are the 243 ways to win on five reels, which can lead to a free spins bonus with wild cloning and multipliers. There's also a buy feature that can lead to a maximum payout of 1000x multiplied by the winning bet.\n\nThe international animal soccer team from iSoftBet is back for another tournament in the Hot Shots 2 slot. Played with a 5-reel, 243 ways to win game engine, it features a bonus round where you can win up to 40 free spins. Look out for special wilds that can spread horizontally and vertically when they land on reels 3, 4, or 5. Plus, during the Free Spins mini-game, these multipliers provide even more substantial rewards.\n\nIn our Hot Shots 2 review, you'll also discover the Ultra Bet Mode. Collect stars during this set of 50 spins to win bonus prizes of up to 1,000x your bet. Referee, can you blow the whistle to start the soccer match!\n\nA Sporty Design\nFrom a design perspective, we can safely say that this is an extravagant slot to review. As we said, the soccer stars are wild animals representing the national teams of England, Spain, France, and probably the Fox representing Portugal if not Italy.\n\nThere are enough moving parts in the game to create an engaging dynamic. We have soccer balls as wild symbols and there's a chance to get a golden one. The low paying symbols are the set of Poker cards, i.e., 9, 10, J, Q, K, and Ace.\n\nHot Shots 2 slot marks big wins with a storm of coins that gush out from the bottom and the wild cloning feature allows you to win much more than you would in a normal slot.\n\nIf you've played the original Hot Shots slot, you'll find a lot of familiar things in this sequel. The setting is a clearing in a forest where cartoon animals are hosting a soccer tournament.\n\nThe cartoon symbols are well-drawn and give the slot a lightweight feel. You'll hear the roar of the crowd and all the other animals participating in the athletic tournament.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nTo win in the game, lucky players would need more than three matching symbols. However, wins start on the leftmost reel and can occur on any line, because Hot Shots 2 offers 243 paylines, so forget about those 10 paylines you are used to on other slot machines.\n\nIn terms of values, the highest paying symbol of the standard symbols is the German shepherd, with 10x multiplied by the winning bet finding the same symbol five times. The rest of the symbols on the Hot Shots 2 slot offer much smaller amounts.\n\nLuckily, there's a wild symbol that is represented by the ball and can appear on reels three, four, and five.\n\nThe game comes with a free spins bonus, multipliers, wild cloning, golden wilds, and much more. Free spins are activated by the scatter symbol, which is the game logo, which stops at three, four, or five points. The result is 10, 15, or 20 free spins in that order.\n\nThe golden wild we talked about is only available in this bonus feature, but it has the ability to clone in any way.\n\nHot Shots 2 brings a buy feature that is a rather expensive way to get 50 spins.\n\nThe action in Hot Shots 2 takes place on a 5-reel, 243 ways to win machine where winning combinations are formed by landing 3 or more matching symbols on adjacent reels, starting from reel 1. Players who have a rather low payroll (i.e., initial budget) can play from 25 cents per spin. If you have a higher budget, you can click on the coin symbol to the right of the reels and adjust your bet accordingly.\n\nClick on the arrows linked above the rotation button for autoplay. You can set between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins, complete with win and loss limits. You can also play in turbo mode. Click on the lightning button in the bottom left corner of the screen to get it into play.\n\nThe RTP for Hot Shots 2 is 96%. In Ultra Bet mode, the standard play is 91.5%, but you also have to consider the 5% for stars, which brings the return to player to a peak of 96.5%.\n\nThe maximum payout is 2,430x your bet per spin. You can win if you fill the reels with the high-value German shepherd symbol. Added multipliers and the Free Spins feature, the maximum win you can get from a single spin is at 12,150x multiplier.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIn the UK, football is a true national authority, which is why we recommend trying the Celtic Football Club slot machine, where you will play as this Celtic football team and it offers 20 always-active paylines and five reels. The game has an RTP of 95.27% and engaging reel action that includes a free spins bonus that includes the chance to score a goal and get a kicker on your winnings. The highest paying symbol brings 1000x and the initial bet is just €0.20 per spin.\n            ",
