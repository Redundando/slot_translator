    "original_text": "\nGoing Underground\nLondra ha davvero tantissime cose da offrire ai visitatori, soprattutto a chi deciderà di utilizzare la sua metropolitana attraverso la slot online Going Underground, firmata da un colosso del settore come  Pragmatic Play. La macchinetta è a tema “storico” e ci porta indietro nel tempo per farci vivere le emozioni del mondo “sotterraneo”, fatto di bonus e funzionalità speciali che possono rendere affascinante ogni scommessa. La sua struttura classica 5×3 è la sola cosa tradizionale che troveremo in questo titolo. Vediamo nel dettaglio cosa ci offre questa slot con un RTP al  95.58% e una serie di funzionalità speciali da provare.\nGrafica e caratteristiche della slot\nPartiamo dalla sua struttura e quindi dall’estetica: oltre alla struttura classica di gioco abbiamo 20 linee di pagamento fisse, sulle quali bisogna trovare almeno 3 simboli corrispondenti per ottenere vincite da sinistra a destra. La parte più affascinante è la scelta dello sfondo: varia infatti in base al tipo di funzione che si attiva. Ma se ci troviamo nel gioco base avremo davanti a noi la metropolitana, con i treni e le sagome di persone in attesa di partire. La grafica è davvero eccezionale, come dimostrano anche i simboli che pagano di più e che sono realizzati in stile caricatura. Ed è così che ci troviamo di fronte a Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, William Shakespeare e molti altri personaggi storici che ci possono assegnare fino a 25 volte la puntata. \nBonus game e funzionalità \nLa slot è ricca di funzionalità bonus che renderanno unico e dinamico il suo gameplay. Abbiamo 5 modificatori che si attivano in modo casuale come il Tunnel Vision che aggiunge simboli misteriosi sui rulli. E non possiamo dimenticare il Big Smoke che presenta un simbolo di pagamento di dimensioni 3×3 o i Wild che scendono casualmente sui rulli.\nPer attivare il round bonus invece dobbiamo sperare di trovare almeno 3 Scatter, che ci porta su 5 possibili round bonus, oppure ci farà accedere all’End of the Line.\nCon Pentonville le combinazioni fortunate si fissano sulla griglia e continuano i respin fino a quando si generano vincite. Nel caso di Kings Cross si ricevono 5 giri aggiuntivi con un rullo centrale che può riempirsi di Jolly. Con Buckingham Palace i giri sono 8 e i simboli jolly coprono l’intero rullo. Canary Wharf offre sempre 8 giri e simboli redditizi che fanno vincere fino a 50 volte la puntata. End of the Line offre 3 respin che si riattivano quando un nuovo simbolo atterra sulla griglia.\n\nFAQ: Le risposte alle domande più frequenti \nChi è il provider della slot Going Underground?\n\nPragmatic Play è un famoso provider che si è specializzato nella produzione di slot, capaci di conquistare più di 70 paesi nel mondo. Offre titoli unici, divertenti e dinamici per azioni di gioco.\n\n\n\nEsiste una versione mobile della slot?\n\nCerto, questa slot è disponibile non solo da desktop ma è ottimizzata per la versione mobile.\n\n\n\nLe funzionalità speciali sono convenienti?\n\nSì, la slot è ricca di occasioni extra tra cui diverse varianti del round Giri gratuiti e bonus che sono entusiasmanti non solo per vincite ma anche per animazione.\n\n\n\n",

Let's take a closer look at what this slot with an RTP of 95.58% and a series of special features has to offer.\n\nGraphics and features of the slot\nLet's start with its structure and aesthetics: in addition to the classic game structure, we have 20 fixed paylines, where at least 3 matching symbols must be found to win from left to right. The most fascinating part is the choice of background: it varies depending on the type of feature activated.

This historic-themed machine takes us back in time to experience the excitement of the \"underground\" world, complete with bonuses and special features that can make every bet fascinating. Its classic 5x3 structure is the only traditional thing we'll find in this title. Let's take a closer look at what this slot machine with an RTP of 95.58% offers, along with a series of special features to try.\n\nSlot graphics and characteristics\nLet's start with its structure and aesthetics: in addition to the classic game structure, we have 20 fixed paylines, on which we must find at least 3 matching symbols to earn payouts from left to right. The most fascinating part is the choice of background, which varies depending on the type of feature activated. But if we are in the base game we are faced with underground trains and silhouettes of people waiting to leave. The graphics are truly exceptional, as demonstrated by the symbols that pay the most and are designed in a cartoon style. And that's how we find ourselves in front of Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, William Shakespeare and many other historical figures who can award us up to 25 times the bet.\n\nBonus games and features\nThe slot is full of bonus features that will make its gameplay unique and dynamic. We have 5 modifiers that activate randomly, such as Tunnel Vision, which adds mysterious symbols to the reels. And we can’t forget about Big Smoke, which features a 3x3 pay symbol, or Wilds that randomly drop onto the reels.\n\nTo activate the bonus round, we need to hope to find at least 3 Scatters, which take us to 5 possible bonus rounds or will give us access to End of the Line.\n\nWith Pentonville, lucky combinations are fixed on the grid and respins continue until winnings are generated. In the case of Kings Cross, we receive 5 additional spins with a central reel that can fill up with Wilds. With Buckingham Palace, we get 8 spins with Wild symbols that cover the entire reel. Canary Wharf always offers 8 spins and lucrative symbols that can win up to 50 times the bet. End of the Line offers 3 respins that are reactivated when a new symbol lands on the grid.\n\nFAQ: Answers to frequently asked questions\nWho is the provider of the Going Underground slot?\n\nPragmatic Play is a famous provider that specializes in producing slots, which can conquer more than 70 countries worldwide. It offers unique, fun and dynamic titles for gameplay.\n\nIs there a mobile version of the slot?\n\nCertainly, this slot is available not only on desktop but is also optimized for the mobile version.\n\nAre the special features worth it?\n\nYes, the slot is full of extra opportunities including various variations of Free Spins rounds and bonuses that are exciting not only for winnings but also for animation.\n            ",

This historic-themed machine takes us back in time to experience the excitement of the \"underground\" world, complete with bonuses and special features that can make every bet fascinating. Its classic 5x3 structure is the only traditional thing we'll find in this title. Let's take a closer look at what this slot machine with an RTP of 95.58% offers, along with a series of special features to try.\n\nSlot graphics and characteristics\nLet's start with its structure and aesthetics: in addition to the classic game structure, we have 20 fixed paylines, on which we must find at least 3 matching symbols to earn payouts from left to right. The most fascinating part is the choice of background, which varies depending on the type of feature activated. But if we are in the base game we are faced with underground trains and silhouettes of people waiting to leave. The graphics are truly exceptional, as demonstrated by the symbols that pay the most and are designed in a cartoon style. And that's how we find ourselves in front of Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, William Shakespeare and many other historical figures who can award us up to 25 times the bet.\n\nBonus games and features\nThe slot is full of bonus features that will make its gameplay unique and dynamic. We have 5 modifiers that activate randomly, such as Tunnel Vision, which adds mysterious symbols to the reels. And we can’t forget about Big Smoke, which features a 3x3 pay symbol, or Wilds that randomly drop onto the reels.\n\nTo activate the bonus round, we need to hope to find at least 3 Scatters, which take us to 5 possible bonus rounds or will give us access to End of the Line.\n\nWith Pentonville, lucky combinations are fixed on the grid and respins continue until winnings are generated. In the case of Kings Cross, we receive 5 additional spins with a central reel that can fill up with Wilds. With Buckingham Palace, we get 8 spins with Wild symbols that cover the entire reel. Canary Wharf always offers 8 spins and lucrative symbols that can win up to 50 times the bet. End of the Line offers 3 respins that are reactivated when a new symbol lands on the grid.\n\nFAQ: Answers to frequently asked questions\nWho is the provider of the Going Underground slot?\n\nPragmatic Play is a famous provider that specializes in producing slots, which can conquer more than 70 countries worldwide. It offers unique, fun and dynamic titles for gameplay.\n\nIs there a mobile version of the slot?\n\nCertainly, this slot is available not only on desktop but is also optimized for the mobile version.\n\nAre the special features worth it?\n\nYes, the slot is full of extra opportunities including various variations of Free Spins rounds and bonuses that are exciting not only for winnings but also for animation.\n            ",

This historic-themed machine takes us back in time to experience the excitement of the \"underground\" world, complete with bonuses and special features that can make every bet fascinating. Its classic 5x3 structure is the only traditional thing we'll find in this title. Let's take a closer look at what this slot machine with an RTP of 95.58% offers, along with a series of special features to try.\n\nSlot graphics and characteristics\nLet's start with its structure and aesthetics: in addition to the classic game structure, we have 20 fixed paylines, on which we must find at least 3 matching symbols to earn payouts from left to right. The most fascinating part is the choice of background, which varies depending on the type of feature activated. But if we are in the base game we are faced with underground trains and silhouettes of people waiting to leave. The graphics are truly exceptional, as demonstrated by the symbols that pay the most and are designed in a cartoon style. And that's how we find ourselves in front of Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, William Shakespeare and many other historical figures who can award us up to 25 times the bet.\n\nBonus games and features\nThe slot is full of bonus features that will make its gameplay unique and dynamic. We have 5 modifiers that activate randomly, such as Tunnel Vision, which adds mysterious symbols to the reels. And we can’t forget about Big Smoke, which features a 3x3 pay symbol, or Wilds that randomly drop onto the reels.\n\nTo activate the bonus round, we need to hope to find at least 3 Scatters, which take us to 5 possible bonus rounds or will give us access to End of the Line.\n\nWith Pentonville, lucky combinations are fixed on the grid and respins continue until winnings are generated. In the case of Kings Cross, we receive 5 additional spins with a central reel that can fill up with Wilds. With Buckingham Palace, we get 8 spins with Wild symbols that cover the entire reel. Canary Wharf always offers 8 spins and lucrative symbols that can win up to 50 times the bet. End of the Line offers 3 respins that are reactivated when a new symbol lands on the grid.\n\nFAQ: Answers to frequently asked questions\nWho is the provider of the Going Underground slot?\n\nPragmatic Play is a famous provider that specializes in producing slots, which can conquer more than 70 countries worldwide. It offers unique, fun and dynamic titles for gameplay.\n\nIs there a mobile version of the slot?\n\nCertainly, this slot is available not only on desktop but is also optimized for the mobile version.\n\nAre the special features worth it?\n\nYes, the slot is full of extra opportunities including various variations of Free Spins rounds and bonuses that are exciting not only for winnings but also for animation.\n            ",
