The game comes with 6 reels and 20 paylines. Juicy Reels is a perfect choice for both high rollers and beginners, as the rules are fairly simple and the special features included in the game give players the chance to reach some interesting wins. You can benefit from Wilds and Scatter Symbols that can activate up to 30 Free Spins during each tripled win. With the full set of unique features from Wazdan, this slot is bound to give you a one-of-a-kind gaming experience. Go ahead and take control of your potential winnings with Volatility Levels and change the look of the slot with Big Screen Mode. You can also reduce loading time with Ultra Lite mode and bring the game speed to a whole new level with Ultra Fast mode.\n\nUser interface and controls\n\nThe control panel underneath the reels is user-friendly and the game options are very intuitive. An Autoplay function takes the hard work out of spinning, leaving the player free to focus on the action as it unfolds. Don't worry if you change your mind halfway through your Autospin; it's easy to interrupt the feature early by pressing the Autoplay button again, which returns control of the reels just in time for the next spin.\n\nSuitability for different player levels\n\nJuicy Reels is a perfect choice for both high rollers and beginners, as the rules are fairly simple and the user interface is very intuitive. The special features included in the game give players the chance to reach some interesting wins, which appeals to all player levels.\n\nSymbols and paylines\n\nJuicy Reels offers a selection of appetizing fruits, including plums, cherries, oranges and lemons, joined on the reels by a series of retro icons commonly seen such as the Liberty Bell, the Bar icon, and a Lucky Number 7. Twenty fixed paylines relieve the player from having to make difficult decisions about the number of lines to include in each spin of the reels. Each payline is always active, so the only choice players have to make is how much to bet for each spin.\n\nComparison to similar games\n\nFruitopia, developed by Merkur, is another great online fruit-based slot game with reels packed to burst with a selection of tantalizingly tasty fruits. Complete with a Jester Wild and a random multiplier that rewards you for matching five symbols, Fruitopia also boasts a Gamble feature after every win, so players can significantly increase their winnings during a gaming session.\n\n        \n            ",

This online slot combines a popular theme related to classic fruit machines with some fantastic bonus features. The vibrant colours that fit its lively theme enhance the gaming experience even further. \n\nA traditional layout\nJuicy Reels comes with 6 reels and 20 paylines. The control panel underneath the reels is user-friendly and the game options are very intuitive. Juicy Reels is a perfect choice for both high rollers and beginners, as the rules are fairly simple and the special features included in the game give players the chance to reach some interesting wins. You can benefit from Wilds and Scatter Symbols that can activate up to 30 Free Spins during each tripled win! Are you interested?\n\nBut that's not all that Juicy Reels has to offer! With the full set of unique features from Wazdan, this slot is bound to give you a one-of-a-kind gaming experience. Go ahead and take control of your potential winnings with Volatility Levels and change the look of the slot with Big Screen Mode. You can also reduce loading time with Ultra Lite mode and bring the game speed to a whole new level with Ultra Fast mode. So take a break from your daily routine and spin the reels of Juicy Reels - a slot that will make your mouth water in an instant with its sweet features!\n\nSlot Machine functions and symbols\nSome retro fruity slot games have only three reels in line with the early days of the genre, but for Juicy Reels, Wazdan has raised the number to six, giving players even more opportunities to win generous cash prizes. A selection of appetizing fruits, including plums, cherries, oranges and lemons, are joined on the reels by a series of retro icons commonly seen such as the Liberty Bell, the Bar icon, and a Lucky Number 7.\n\nTwenty fixed paylines relieve the player from having to make difficult decisions about the number of lines to include in each spin of the reels. Each payline is always active, so the only choice players have to make is how much to bet for each spin. Then it's time to spin those reels and find out if those symbols align diagonally on the paylines to deliver those all-important cash rewards.\n\nAn Autoplay function takes the hard work out of spinning, leaving the player free to focus on the action as it unfolds. Don't worry if you change your mind halfway through your Autospin; it's easy to interrupt the feature early by pressing the Autoplay button again, which returns control of the reels just in time for the next spin.\n\nRetro game or not, Juicy Reels offers the modern player some extra excitement, elevating this game above the ordinary. There's a helpful Wild symbol, for example, that can replace any other symbol on the reels, so even if at first glance it seems like a spin hasn't created a winning line, a well-placed Wild can help to make the numbers add up and lead to a cash payout.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines:\nDeveloped by Merkur, Fruitopia is another great online fruit-based slot game with reels packed to burst with a selection of tantalizingly tasty fruits. Complete with a Jester Wild and a random multiplier that rewards you for matching five symbols, Fruitopia also boasts a Gamble feature after every win, so players can significantly increase their winnings during a gaming session.\n            ",

This online slot combines a popular theme related to classic fruit machines with some fantastic bonus features. The vibrant colours that fit its lively theme enhance the gaming experience even further. \n\nA traditional layout\nJuicy Reels comes with 6 reels and 20 paylines. The control panel underneath the reels is user-friendly and the game options are very intuitive. Juicy Reels is a perfect choice for both high rollers and beginners, as the rules are fairly simple and the special features included in the game give players the chance to reach some interesting wins. You can benefit from Wilds and Scatter Symbols that can activate up to 30 Free Spins during each tripled win! Are you interested?\n\nBut that's not all that Juicy Reels has to offer! With the full set of unique features from Wazdan, this slot is bound to give you a one-of-a-kind gaming experience. Go ahead and take control of your potential winnings with Volatility Levels and change the look of the slot with Big Screen Mode. You can also reduce loading time with Ultra Lite mode and bring the game speed to a whole new level with Ultra Fast mode. So take a break from your daily routine and spin the reels of Juicy Reels - a slot that will make your mouth water in an instant with its sweet features!\n\nSlot Machine functions and symbols\nSome retro fruity slot games have only three reels in line with the early days of the genre, but for Juicy Reels, Wazdan has raised the number to six, giving players even more opportunities to win generous cash prizes. A selection of appetizing fruits, including plums, cherries, oranges and lemons, are joined on the reels by a series of retro icons commonly seen such as the Liberty Bell, the Bar icon, and a Lucky Number 7.\n\nTwenty fixed paylines relieve the player from having to make difficult decisions about the number of lines to include in each spin of the reels. Each payline is always active, so the only choice players have to make is how much to bet for each spin. Then it's time to spin those reels and find out if those symbols align diagonally on the paylines to deliver those all-important cash rewards.\n\nAn Autoplay function takes the hard work out of spinning, leaving the player free to focus on the action as it unfolds. Don't worry if you change your mind halfway through your Autospin; it's easy to interrupt the feature early by pressing the Autoplay button again, which returns control of the reels just in time for the next spin.\n\nRetro game or not, Juicy Reels offers the modern player some extra excitement, elevating this game above the ordinary. There's a helpful Wild symbol, for example, that can replace any other symbol on the reels, so even if at first glance it seems like a spin hasn't created a winning line, a well-placed Wild can help to make the numbers add up and lead to a cash payout.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines:\nDeveloped by Merkur, Fruitopia is another great online fruit-based slot game with reels packed to burst with a selection of tantalizingly tasty fruits. Complete with a Jester Wild and a random multiplier that rewards you for matching five symbols, Fruitopia also boasts a Gamble feature after every win, so players can significantly increase their winnings during a gaming session.\n        ",
