Atlantis Queen è una slot machine che è stata progettata e sviluppata da un colosso del settore gambling come Playtech. Il suo punto forte è sicuramente la funzione Pearl Bonus che permette al giocatore di scegliere tra 9 perle che sono legate a un premio in denaro. Ma non è tutto: si presenta nel gioco anche la funzione bonus del tempio di Atlantide che offrirà 14 giri gratuiti e la possibilità di avere un moltiplicatore 3x. A livello strutturale si parte da una griglia di gioco con 5 rulli e 25 linee di pagamento. Ti senti pronto a sfidare la fortuna e scoprire che cos’ha da offrire l’isola di Atlantide? E allora tuffati sott’acqua e cerca di trovare i ricchi tesori che sono sepolti insieme a quest’immaginaria bellezza naturale, incontrando scrigni, serene e l’immancabile Poseidone.\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nL’acqua è uno dei più affascinanti luoghi da esplorare e lo sarà soprattutto se deciderai di provare questa slot machine online. Atlantis Queen è un mix equilibrato di simboli Scatter, Jolly, moltiplicatori, bonus game e giri gratuiti. Per riuscire a mettere mano sui tesori che sono nascosti nel gameplay ti basterà iniziare a scommettere da una cifra minima di 0,25 centesimi.\nA livello grafico apprezziamo la bellissima rappresentazione di questo mondo subacqueo, che ha sempre grande fascino. Per approfondire questa tematica sono stati scelti simboli semplici ma ricchi di dettagli: pensiamo, per esempio, a Poseidone che è in assoluto il più remunerativo. Se riuscirai a posizionare 5 simboli uguali nella linea di pagamento potrai vincere 5.000 volte la tua puntata. Subito dopo questa icona troviamo il simbolo dello scrigno del tesoro, la cui vittoria è fissata a un valore di 1.000 volte la tua scommessa se ne troverai 5. Ma quali sono i suoi simboli speciali? La sirena, considerata in tutto e per tutto la regina di Atlantide è il simbolo jolly. Potrà presentarsi durante il gameplay e posizionarsi solo nei rulli centrali, ovvero il 2, 3 e 4. Come avviene in tutte le slot, anche in questo caso è capace di sostituire tutti i simboli tranne i simboli Scatter del tempio.\nNon abbiamo però ancora chiamato in causa le perle di Atlantis Queen: quando si attiva la funzione Pearl Bonus il giocatore è proiettato su una schermata con 9 perle che possono attribuire dei premi in denaro, diversificati per oro, argento o bronzo. In base alla perla che scegli, potrai conquistare così il saldo che è attribuito a ognuna di loro. Se invece trovi 3 o più simboli del Tempio si attiverà un’altra funzione Bonus dove dovrai cliccare sui mattoni per stabilire quanti giri gratuiti ottieni e il valore del moltiplicatore attribuito.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Atlantis Queen\nAtlantis Queen è sicuramente una slot che può ammaliare molti giocatori, sia esperti che alle prime armi con il mondo del gambling. Offre in modo costante delle piccole vincite legate al gioco base, ma diventano più prestigiose quando si riesce a sfruttare, in particolare, la funzione di giri gratuiti, grazie anche agli Scatter in espansione.\n",

Atlantis Queen is a slot machine created by the gambling giant Playtech. Its standout feature is undoubtedly the Pearl Bonus function, which allows players to choose from 9 pearls, each connected to a cash prize. But that's not all: the game also includes the Atlantis Temple bonus feature, which offers 14 free spins and the chance to have a 3x multiplier. Structurally, the game starts with a 5-reel grid and 25 paylines. Are you ready to challenge fate and discover what the island of Atlantis has to offer? Then dive into the deep and search for the rich treasures buried with this imaginary natural beauty, encountering treasure chests, sirens, and the inevitable Poseidon.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nWater is one of the most fascinating places to explore, and it will be especially so if you decide to try this online slot machine. Atlantis Queen is a well-balanced mix of Scatter symbols, Wilds, multipliers, bonus games, and free spins. To get your hands on the treasures hidden in the gameplay, all you need to do is bet from a minimum amount of 0.25 cents.\n\nGraphically, we appreciate the beautiful representation of this underwater world, which has always been alluring. Simple yet detailed symbols have been chosen to deepen this theme: think, for example, of Poseidon, who is by far the most lucrative. If you manage to place 5 identical symbols on the payline, you can win 5,000 times your bet. Immediately after this icon, we find the symbol of the treasure chest, whose victory is fixed at a value of 1,000 times your bet if you find 5. But what about its special symbols? The siren, considered the queen of Atlantis in every respect, is the Wild symbol. It can appear during gameplay and position itself only on the central reels, 2, 3, and 4. As in all slots, in this case too, it can replace all symbols except the Temple Scatter symbols.\n\nHowever, we have not yet mentioned the pearls of Atlantis Queen: when the Pearl Bonus function is activated, the player is projected onto a screen with 9 pearls that can assign cash prizes, differentiated into gold, silver, or bronze. Based on the pearl you choose, you can win the balance allotted to each of them. If, on the other hand, you find 3 or more Temple symbols, another Bonus function will be activated, where you will have to click on the bricks to establish how many free spins you get and the value of the multiplier assigned.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Atlantis Queen slot\nAtlantis Queen is undoubtedly a slot machine that can enthrall many players, both experienced and new to the gambling world. It consistently offers small wins tied to the base game, but they become more prestigious when you manage to take advantage of the free spins feature, thanks also to the expanding Scatter symbols.\n            ",

There is also the Atlantis Temple bonus feature, which gives players 14 free spins and a 3x multiplier.\n\nGame setting and theme: Underwater world\n\nAtlantis Queen is set in the underwater world of the lost city of Atlantis.

Atlantis Queen is a slot machine created by the gambling giant Playtech. Its standout feature is undoubtedly the Pearl Bonus function, which allows players to choose from 9 pearls, each connected to a cash prize. But that's not all: the game also includes the Atlantis Temple bonus feature, which offers 14 free spins and the chance to have a 3x multiplier. Structurally, the game starts with a 5-reel grid and 25 paylines. Are you ready to challenge fate and discover what the island of Atlantis has to offer? Then dive into the deep and search for the rich treasures buried with this imaginary natural beauty, encountering treasure chests, sirens, and the inevitable Poseidon.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nWater is one of the most fascinating places to explore, and it will be especially so if you decide to try this online slot machine. Atlantis Queen is a well-balanced mix of Scatter symbols, Wilds, multipliers, bonus games, and free spins. To get your hands on the treasures hidden in the gameplay, all you need to do is bet from a minimum amount of 0.25 cents.\n\nGraphically, we appreciate the beautiful representation of this underwater world, which has always been alluring. Simple yet detailed symbols have been chosen to deepen this theme: think, for example, of Poseidon, who is by far the most lucrative. If you manage to place 5 identical symbols on the payline, you can win 5,000 times your bet. Immediately after this icon, we find the symbol of the treasure chest, whose victory is fixed at a value of 1,000 times your bet if you find 5. But what about its special symbols? The siren, considered the queen of Atlantis in every respect, is the Wild symbol. It can appear during gameplay and position itself only on the central reels, 2, 3, and 4. As in all slots, in this case too, it can replace all symbols except the Temple Scatter symbols.\n\nHowever, we have not yet mentioned the pearls of Atlantis Queen: when the Pearl Bonus function is activated, the player is projected onto a screen with 9 pearls that can assign cash prizes, differentiated into gold, silver, or bronze. Based on the pearl you choose, you can win the balance allotted to each of them. If, on the other hand, you find 3 or more Temple symbols, another Bonus function will be activated, where you will have to click on the bricks to establish how many free spins you get and the value of the multiplier assigned.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Atlantis Queen slot\nAtlantis Queen is undoubtedly a slot machine that can enthrall many players, both experienced and new to the gambling world. It consistently offers small wins tied to the base game, but they become more prestigious when you manage to take advantage of the free spins feature, thanks also to the expanding Scatter symbols.\n            ",

Atlantis Queen is a slot machine created by the gambling giant Playtech. Its standout feature is undoubtedly the Pearl Bonus function, which allows players to choose from 9 pearls, each connected to a cash prize. But that's not all: the game also includes the Atlantis Temple bonus feature, which offers 14 free spins and the chance to have a 3x multiplier. Structurally, the game starts with a 5-reel grid and 25 paylines. Are you ready to challenge fate and discover what the island of Atlantis has to offer? Then dive into the deep and search for the rich treasures buried with this imaginary natural beauty, encountering treasure chests, sirens, and the inevitable Poseidon.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nWater is one of the most fascinating places to explore, and it will be especially so if you decide to try this online slot machine. Atlantis Queen is a well-balanced mix of Scatter symbols, Wilds, multipliers, bonus games, and free spins. To get your hands on the treasures hidden in the gameplay, all you need to do is bet from a minimum amount of 0.25 cents.\n\nGraphically, we appreciate the beautiful representation of this underwater world, which has always been alluring. Simple yet detailed symbols have been chosen to deepen this theme: think, for example, of Poseidon, who is by far the most lucrative. If you manage to place 5 identical symbols on the payline, you can win 5,000 times your bet. Immediately after this icon, we find the symbol of the treasure chest, whose victory is fixed at a value of 1,000 times your bet if you find 5. But what about its special symbols? The siren, considered the queen of Atlantis in every respect, is the Wild symbol. It can appear during gameplay and position itself only on the central reels, 2, 3, and 4. As in all slots, in this case too, it can replace all symbols except the Temple Scatter symbols.\n\nHowever, we have not yet mentioned the pearls of Atlantis Queen: when the Pearl Bonus function is activated, the player is projected onto a screen with 9 pearls that can assign cash prizes, differentiated into gold, silver, or bronze. Based on the pearl you choose, you can win the balance allotted to each of them. If, on the other hand, you find 3 or more Temple symbols, another Bonus function will be activated, where you will have to click on the bricks to establish how many free spins you get and the value of the multiplier assigned.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Atlantis Queen slot\nAtlantis Queen is undoubtedly a slot machine that can enthrall many players, both experienced and new to the gambling world. It consistently offers small wins tied to the base game, but they become more prestigious when you manage to take advantage of the free spins feature, thanks also to the expanding Scatter symbols.\n        ",
