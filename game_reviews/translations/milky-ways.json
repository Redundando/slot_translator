Discover how to play this brilliant slot without registration, also available on mobile, in the vast library of free slots created for you by Slotajava!\n\nGameplay of the precious slot Milky Ways\n\nWith a first prize available of X5664 and an RTP of 96.14%, the game promises well! If you're a fan of slots, Milky Ways will remind you visually of the Starburst genre by NetEnt, with sparkling gems floating in space. In Milky Ways, there are 243 ways to win and you can bet from €0.20 up to €100.00 per spin. To start playing, you just have to follow a few quick steps:\n\nTake a look at the Paytable and Rules by clicking on the menu. Here, you can adjust the game volume settings and choose your bet by clicking on the dollar sign button on the lower left.\nCheck the autoplay options, where you can also set loss and win limits based on a percentage of your balance.\nIf you want to speed up the spin, you can click on the lightning button under the SPIN button.\nNow all you have to do is press SPIN and have fun!\n\nHow to win at the Milky Ways slot?\n\nSince there are no official paylines in this game, winning combinations are made by landing 3 or more matching symbols on adjacent reels. The most generous symbol in the game is the red diamond, which pays a prize worth 2.5 times the bet and a total final prize worth X5664.\n\nWhat are the Free Spins and Bonus features?\n\nSolar Wild - This is the first special bonus feature you will encounter when playing the Milky Ways slot. This is a wild symbol that appears only on the three central reels and has a multiplier from 1 to 3 times. In case more than one Solar Wild appears in one spin, they will be multiplied by each other;\nMilky Ways Spins Round - composed of three bonus symbols that work on the central reels. Two more rows are added to the game to give a total of 3125 chances of winning combinations!\nFusion Spin - are re-spins that are activated during the Milky Ways Free Spins bonus. During this bonus, winning symbols are locked in position and all non-winning symbols are spun again to have the chance to add more symbols to the win.\n\nFinal thoughts on Milky Ways\n\nThis slot represents the most basic title of the Nolimit City company, especially when compared to games like Bonus Bunnies and Punk Rocker, but it is always positive that a brand includes different game products in its collection. The wild multipliers offer great potential winnings in the base game, but it is in the Free Spins round where you can really find the difference! I noticed that it takes a little time before Free Spins are rewarded. It took three rounds before I got a win worth over 5 times my bet. Fortunately, I managed to activate the Free Spins round 3 times in 100 spins, so it's not impossible to win! In conclusion, I can confirm that Nolimit City's Milky Ways is a good slot to try classic slot games with a touch of modernity. It mixes both elements without making the gameplay too complex and at the same time offers generous potential winnings.\n\nFAQ about the Milky Ways slot\n\nWhat is the RTP of Milky Ways?\n\nThe RTP of the Nolimit City Milky Ways slot is 96.14%.\n\nWhat is the maximum win available on Milky Ways?\n\nThe biggest payout you can get while playing Milky Ways is 5664 times your bet.\n\nIs there a Free Spins bonus in Milky Ways?\n\nOf course! The Free Spins bonus is activated when you get three bonus symbols. Here, 2 wilds are always guaranteed to land on the reels and repetitions are awarded every time you get a win.\n\nWhat are Nolimit City's most volatile slots?\n\nIf you are looking for a higher gain, I suggest trying the free slots Tombstone, Punk Rocker, and Deadwood in the virtual Slotjava library.\n            ",

It has 243 ways to win that expands to 3125 in the Free Spins Bonus Round. Players can activate wilds and multiplier repetitions. Betting range from €0.20 up to €100.00 per spin.\n\nBonus Features\n\nMilky Ways has multiple bonus features, including wild symbols that can appear on the three central reels and have a multiplier from 1 to 3 times. The Milky Ways Spins Round is composed of three bonus symbols that work on the central reels; two extra rows are added to the game to give a total of 3125 chances of winning combinations. The Fusion Spin is a re-spin that is activated during the Milky Ways Free Spins bonus. During this bonus, winning symbols are locked in position, and all non-winning symbols are spun again to have the chance to add more symbols to the win.\n\nHighest Paying Symbol\n\nThe red diamond is the most generous symbol in the game, which pays a prize worth 2.5 times the bet and a total final prize worth X5664.\n\nMultiplier Repetitions\n\nMore than one Solar Wild can appear in one spin across the three central reels, and they will be multiplied by each other. In the Free Spins Bonus Round, repetitions are awarded every time the player wins.\n\nAccessibility (free and mobile)\n\nPlayers can play Milky Ways without registration on Slotajava and other online casinos. This game is available on mobile, making it convenient for players to play anywhere and anytime.\n\nDeveloper (Nolimit City)\n\nNolimit City is the developer behind Milky Ways. It is a basic title compared to other games from the company, such as Bonus Bunnies and Punk Rocker. However, this game mixes both classic elements and a touch of modernity without making the gameplay too complex. The game offers generous potential winnings, especially during the Free Spins round.\n\n        \n            ",
