Inoltre, se compare su tutti i cinque rulli, paga una vincita di ben 5000 gettoni!\nLo Scatter è invece un’imponente piramide che dà accesso all’unica funzionalità bonus di questa slot, ossia i giri gratuiti. Se compare 3 volte in qualsiasi posizione sui rulli saranno attivati 8 giri gratuiti, se ne vinceranno 15 con 4 piramidi e 100 se lo Scatter occupa tutti i cinque rulli.\nIn seguito a ogni vincita di qualsiasi entità, sarà data al giocatore la possibilità di raddoppiare il montepremi con una funzione Gamble: comparirà una carta girata della quale bisognerà indovinare il colore, nero o rosso. Se la scommessa è giusta il montepremi sarà raddoppiato, se è sbagliata purtroppo si perde quanto vinto in precedenza.\n\nSlot simili a Treasures of the Pyramids\nIl tema dell’Antico Egitto rappresenta nel mondo delle slot machine una vena che pare non esaurirsi mai e tutte le principali software house del mondo hanno nel loro catalogo almeno un titolo che celebra questa civiltà.\nUna delle slot a tema Egitto più giocate in assoluto al mondo è Book of Ra, disponibile in diverse versioni tra cui la Deluxe e la 6, per giocare e vincere sotto lo sguardo fiero della Sfinge!\n\n",

But fear not, there are also various types of jewelry, pyramids, the Ankh or Ansata cross, and the right eye of Horus, along with hieroglyphic-style letters and numbers corresponding to poker cards from 9 to Ace. </p><p>One symbol that seems a bit out of place in this culturally-themed slot game is the black panther. Maybe the ancient Egyptians had a secret panther goddess we don't know about? Either way, this furball acts as the Wild symbol.</p><p>As for the game structure, it follows a classic setup of five reels and 40 paylines. Even though it's not as flashy as some other slots out there, the simplicity allows for easy gameplay and helps you focus on the adorable symbols on the screen.</p>\"\n}"

Players can select the number of paylines they want to bet on, from 1 to all 40 paylines.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols in Treasures of the Pyramids reference the culture of ancient Egypt and include various types of jewelry, pyramids, the Ankh or Ansata cross, the right eye of the falcon god Horus, and hieroglyphic style letters and numbers corresponding to the poker cards from 9 to Ace. The black panther is the Wild symbol, and the Scatter symbol takes the form of an imposing pyramid.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe only bonus feature in Treasures of the Pyramids is free spins triggered by the Scatter symbol.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame Structure and Symbols\n\nTreasures of the Pyramids takes players on a journey to ancient Egypt with symbols to match. The symbols include various types of jewelry, pyramids, the Ankh or Ansata cross, and the right eye of Horus, along with hieroglyphic-style letters and numbers corresponding to poker cards from 9 to Ace. The black panther symbol seems out of place in this culturally-themed slot game and acts as the Wild symbol. The game has a classic structure of five reels and 40 paylines.\n\nBetting Options and Paylines\n\nPlayers must first set the value of their tokens, ranging from €0.01 to €1 per spin. They are then asked to select the number of tokens they wish to play, from 1 to 10, and on how many paylines they want to bet, on 1, 10, 20, 30, or all 40 paylines. The max bet in this game is €400 per spin.\n\nUnique Black Panther Symbol\n\nThe black panther appears as the Wild symbol in Treasures of the Pyramids and can replace any other symbol on the reels to complete a winning combination. If it appears on all five reels, players will win a prize of 5000 tokens. Although the black panther doesn't quite fit in with the Ancient Egyptian theme, it brings an element of excitement to the game and enhances winning potential.\n\nFree Spin Feature with Potential for Big Wins\n\nThe Scatter symbol, represented by an imposing pyramid, triggers the free spin feature. If the Scatter appears in any position on the reels three times, players will be given eight free spins. If four pyramids appear, players will win 15 free spins, and if the Scatter symbol covers all five reels, players will be rewarded with 100 free spins. The free spin feature comes with the potential for big wins and can be re-triggered.\n\nGamble Feature for Doubled Winnings\n\nAfter any winning combination, players have the option to double their winnings with the Gamble feature. To double their winnings, players must correctly guess the color of a face-down card, either black or red. If they guess correctly, their winnings will be doubled, but if they guess wrong, they will lose their previous winnings.\n\n        \n            ",

They will then be asked to select the number of tokens they wish to play, from 1 to 10, and on how many paylines they want to bet, on 1, 10, 20, 30, or all 40 paylines.\n\nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters\nThe symbols are all references to the culture of the ancient Egyptian people, except for the aforementioned black panther, including various types of jewelry, pyramids, the Ankh or Ansata cross (an ancient symbol representing life), and the right eye of the falcon god Horus. The letters and numbers corresponding to the poker cards from 9 to Ace are also included in hieroglyphic style.\nThe black panther in Treasures of the Pyramids is the Wild symbol and acts as a Joker, as it can replace all other symbols, except for the Scatter, on the reels to complete a winning combination. Moreover, if it appears on all five reels, players will win a prize of 5000 tokens!\nThe Scatter symbol takes the form of an imposing pyramid, which triggers the only bonus feature of this slot game, namely free spins. If it appears in any position on the reels three times, eight free spins will be activated. If four pyramids appear, players will win 15 free spins, and if the Scatter symbol covers all five reels, players will win 100 free spins.\nAfter any winning combination, players will have the option to double their winnings with the Gamble feature. Players must guess the color of a face-down card, either black or red. If they guess correctly, their winnings will be doubled, but if they guess wrong, they will lose their previous winnings.\n\nSimilar Slots to Treasures of the Pyramids\nThe theme of Ancient Egypt remains a popular choice for slot machines and a favorite among experienced gamblers. Book of Ra, available in various versions like the Deluxe and the 6, is one of the most played Egyptian-themed slots in the world, allowing players to play and win big under the watchful eye of the Sphinx!\n        ",
