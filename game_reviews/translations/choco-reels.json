Anche i simboli che si alternano sui rulli di Choco Reels sono interamente rappresentati da delle leccornie colorate, mentre sulla parte inferiore dello schermo troviamo i tasti per il settaggio del gioco, che includono l’avvio dei giri, le impostazioni di puntata e il tanto “i”, grazie al quale potrete conoscere nel dettaglio il valore di ciascun simbolo e delle combinazioni vincenti.\nNel complesso, per quanto riguarda il compartimento grafico, non si tratta di un gioco strabiliante, ma nella sua semplicità l’abbiamo trovato molto piacevole e accattivante, l’ideale per chi vuole giocare senza troppe distrazioni e avere un’esperienza di gioco davvero dolcissima!\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nChoco Reels, nonostante la grafica abbastanza semplice, vanta un gameplay al contrario molto articolato, con diverse funzioni speciali e bonus e una vincita massima potenziale pari a 9.500 volte il valore della puntata.\nLa griglia di gioco di questa squisita slot machine di casa Wazdan è composta da sei rulli, sei righe e prevede ben 2.203 linee di pagamento, che possono arrivare fino 46.656 man mano che si completano i diversi livelli di gioco, davvero impressionante!\nSu Choco Reels potete effettuare le vostre puntate a partire da soli 2 centesimi fino a un massimo di 100 €, un range di scommessa molto ampio adatto sia a coloro che non vogliono spendere grosse somme, sia agli high rollers che invece amano le emozioni di una puntata alta!\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore (Return to Player o RTP) di Choco Reels si attesta su un più che buono 96,22 %, lievemente al di sopra della media della maggior parte dei giochi di slot.\nSimboli e funzionalità speciali di Choco Reels\nI simboli che troviamo sui rulli di Choco Reels sono tutti tematici e comprendono un golosissimo e vario assortimento di dolciumi, con valore diverso. Il simbolo che paga di più è rappresentato da un lecca-lecca a forma di spirale, mentre quelli che hanno valore inferiore sono le caramelle e i bastoncini di zucchero.\nOltre ai simboli regolari sono presenti alcuni simboli speciali: il Wild, un cestino di dolciumi, lo Scatter, un donut, un insetto, che sblocca progressivamente le posizioni sui rulli. Una volta che tutte le posizioni sui rulli sono state sbloccate si accede al giro bonus Choco, che prevede 6 free spins. Dopo ogni giro il moltiplicatore aumenta di 1, incrementando così le possibilità di ottenere dei premi davvero sostanziosi!\n",
