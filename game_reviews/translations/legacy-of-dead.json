Legacy of Dead is an Egyptian themed game, one of many in fact, but thanks to some special features and high (very high) volatility with a really staggering jackpot, it should stand out from the myriad of other slot machines set in the shadow of the pyramids.\n\nThe Egyptian theme is developed in Legacy of Dead by setting the game in a sort of ancient burial chamber, with symbols that refer to the best tradition of the gods of ancient Egypt. This slot machine closely resembles its sister, also from Play’N’Go, Book of Dead, but compared to it, has some extra features and is, overall, much more modern.\n\nThe graphic compartment of Legacy of Dead does not deny Play’N’Go's choice to always aim for the highest quality: the images are beautiful and, combined with high-definition animations, guarantee a truly incredible gaming experience. The range of bets goes from just 10 cents up to €100, with a stellar jackpot that reaches 25,000 times the bet and a theoretical return to player (RTP) that stands at an excellent 96.58%.\n\nWinning on Legacy of Dead will not be easy, but you will have the chance to take home some really interesting sums!\n\nRegular and special symbols of Legacy of Dead\nThe symbols of Legacy of Dead are represented first and foremost by the numbers and letters that refer to playing cards from 10 to Ace, the so-called \"royals\".

Legacy of Dead is an Egyptian-themed game, one of many in fact, but thanks to some special features and a high (very high) volatility with an absolutely dizzying jackpot, it should stand out from the myriad of other slot machines set in the shadow of the pyramids.\n\nThe Egyptian theme is developed in Legacy of Dead by setting the game in a sort of ancient burial chamber, with symbols that refer to the best traditions of the deities of Ancient Egypt. This slot machine closely resembles its sister, also from Play'N'Go, Book of Dead, but compared to that one it has more features and is overall much more modern.\n\nThe graphics department of Legacy of Dead does not deny Play'N'Go's choice to always aim for maximum quality: the images are splendid and, joined with high-definition animations, guarantee an incredible gaming experience. The betting range goes from just 10 cents up to 100 €, with a stellar jackpot that reaches 25,000 times the bet and a theoretical return to player (RTP) that stands at an excellent 96.58%.\n\nWinning on Legacy of Dead won't be easy, but you'll have the chance to take home some really interesting sums!\n\nRegular and special symbols of Legacy of Dead\nThe symbols of Legacy of Dead are represented first and foremost by the numbers and letters that refer to the playing cards from 10 to Ace, the so-called \"royals\".

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay mechanics and rules\nTheme and graphics\nVolatility and potential payouts\nSpecial symbols and features\nFree spins and bonus rounds\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Legacy of Dead\nThe software house Play'N'Go has decided to start off 2020 with a bang, launching a slot machine that promises to make even the most difficult players happy! Legacy of Dead is an Egyptian-themed game, one of many in fact, but thanks to some special features and a high (very high) volatility with an absolutely dizzying jackpot, it should stand out from the myriad of other slot machines set in the shadow of the pyramids.\n\nThe Egyptian theme is developed in Legacy of Dead by setting the game in a sort of ancient burial chamber, with symbols that refer to the best traditions of the deities of Ancient Egypt. This slot machine closely resembles its sister, also from Play'N'Go, Book of Dead, but compared to that one it has more features and is overall much more modern.\n\nThe graphics department of Legacy of Dead does not deny Play'N'Go's choice to always aim for maximum quality: the images are splendid and, joined with high-definition animations, guarantee an incredible gaming experience. The betting range goes from just 10 cents up to 100 €, with a stellar jackpot that reaches 25,000 times the bet and a theoretical return to player (RTP) that stands at an excellent 96.58%.\n\nWinning on Legacy of Dead won't be easy, but you'll have the chance to take home some really interesting sums!\n\nRegular and special symbols of Legacy of Dead\nThe symbols of Legacy of Dead are represented first and foremost by the numbers and letters that refer to the playing cards from 10 to Ace, the so-called \"royals\". In addition to these, we have the more typically themed symbols that include:\n\nThe hawk god Horus: combinations of 2, 3, 4 or 5 symbols pay 0.5, 2, 8 or 60 times the bet.\nPharaoh: combinations of 2, 3, 4 or 5 symbols pay 0.5, 2, 8 or 60 times the bet.\nAnubis (God of the Dead): combinations of 2, 3, 4 or 5 symbols pay 0.5, 3, 30 or 160 times the bet.\nTutankhamun: combinations of 2, 3, 4 or 5 symbols pay 1, 10, 100 or 500 times the bet.\n\nIn addition to these, there is also the symbol of the burial chamber, which acts as both a Wild and a Scatter.\n\nSpecial features of Legacy of Dead\nThe most enticing special feature of Legacy of Dead is represented by the free spins feature activated thanks to the symbol of the burial chamber: if three or more Wild/Scatter appear on the reels, you can play ten free spins and receive a payout of 2, 20 or 200 times the bet.\n\nAnother unique feature is the ability to obtain up to nine expandable special symbols, which will bring new winning combinations and allow you to try and take home the maximum payout of 25,000 times the bet, during the free spins.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the RTP percentage?\n\nWe cannot say that the RTP of Legacy of Dead breaks records as it is 94.51%. The most played slots usually have an RTP of about 96% and approach 97% to give more back to the players.\n\nAre there free spins for Legacy of Dead without a deposit?\n\nIf you want to get free spins for Legacy of Dead without making a deposit, you'll need to do some research. Browse our list of the best casinos and check the actual information on current bonuses.\n\nCan I play Legacy of Dead for free?\n\nYes, Slotjava is the right place to try out Legacy of Dead without registration.

Legacy of Dead is an Egyptian-themed game, one of many in fact, but thanks to some special features and a high (very high) volatility with an absolutely dizzying jackpot, it should stand out from the myriad of other slot machines set in the shadow of the pyramids.\n\nThe Egyptian theme is developed in Legacy of Dead by setting the game in a sort of ancient burial chamber, with symbols that refer to the best traditions of the deities of Ancient Egypt.

The betting range goes from just 10 cents up to 100 €, with a stellar jackpot that reaches 25,000 times the bet and a theoretical return to player (RTP) that stands at an excellent 96.58%.\n\nWinning on Legacy of Dead won't be easy, but you'll have the chance to take home some really interesting sums!\n\nRegular and special symbols of Legacy of Dead\nThe symbols of Legacy of Dead are represented first and foremost by the numbers and letters that refer to the playing cards from 10 to Ace, the so-called \"royals\".

The betting range goes from just 10 cents up to 100 €, with a stellar jackpot that reaches 25,000 times the bet and a theoretical return to player (RTP) that stands at an excellent 96.58%.\n\nWinning on Legacy of Dead won't be easy, but you'll have the chance to take home some really interesting sums!\n\nRegular and special symbols of Legacy of Dead\nThe symbols of Legacy of Dead are represented first and foremost by the numbers and letters that refer to the playing cards from 10 to Ace, the so-called \"royals\". In addition to these, we have the more typically themed symbols that include:\n\nThe hawk god Horus: combinations of 2, 3, 4 or 5 symbols pay 0.5, 2, 8 or 60 times the bet.\nPharaoh: combinations of 2, 3, 4 or 5 symbols pay 0.5, 2, 8 or 60 times the bet.\nAnubis (God of the Dead): combinations of 2, 3, 4 or 5 symbols pay 0.5, 3, 30 or 160 times the bet.\nTutankhamun: combinations of 2, 3, 4 or 5 symbols pay 1, 10, 100 or 500 times the bet.\n\nIn addition to these, there is also the symbol of the burial chamber, which acts as both a Wild and a Scatter.\n\nSpecial features of Legacy of Dead\nThe most enticing special feature of Legacy of Dead is represented by the free spins feature activated thanks to the symbol of the burial chamber: if three or more Wild/Scatter appear on the reels, you can play ten free spins and receive a payout of 2, 20 or 200 times the bet.\n\nAnother unique feature is the ability to obtain up to nine expandable special symbols, which will bring new winning combinations and allow you to try and take home the maximum payout of 25,000 times the bet, during the free spins.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the RTP percentage?\n\nWe cannot say that the RTP of Legacy of Dead breaks records as it is 94.51%. The most played slots usually have an RTP of about 96% and approach 97% to give more back to the players.\n\nAre there free spins for Legacy of Dead without a deposit?\n\nIf you want to get free spins for Legacy of Dead without making a deposit, you'll need to do some research. Browse our list of the best casinos and check the actual information on current bonuses.\n\nCan I play Legacy of Dead for free?\n\nYes, Slotjava is the right place to try out Legacy of Dead without registration.
