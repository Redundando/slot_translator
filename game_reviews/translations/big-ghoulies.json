Questa slot machine è ispirata alla serie di film “Haunted House”; l’ambientazione di gioco e tutti i simboli presenti infatti, fanno riferimento a creature della notte e mostri tipici delle rappresentazioni dell’orrore. La musica e gli effetti sonori utilizzati sono studiati, a loro volta, per creare un ambiente il più tetro e maligno possibile; urla e risatine diaboliche accompagnano infatti la partita facendo correre un brivido di paura lungo la schiena dei giocatori!\nGrafica della slot machine\nI progressi fatti in questo settore dalla software house WMG sono ancora più evidenti grazie a questo titolo. La nuova veste grafica presentata per la rinnovata slot Big Ghoulies, è la dimostrazione tangibile dei passi in avanti fatti da questa azienda. Le animazioni sono state realizzate in maniera molto fluida; ognuno dei simboli utilizzati ne ha una propria, unica rispetto alle altre presenti. Come specificato, tutti i personaggi fanno riferimento al mondo dell’horror, abbiamo infatti: una Donna Vampiro che funge inoltre da simbolo Wild della slot machine, un Vampiro, uno Gnomo verde, una Zucca tipica di Halloween, Frankenstein e una Casa dell’orrore necessaria per attivare il Bonus stage del gioco. Insieme a questi simboli tipicamente oscuri, ne troviamo altri a tema più classico come, il grappolo di Ciliegie, il grappolo d’Uva, il Limone e la Mela. È possibile giocare con la slot attraverso la modalità “Autoplay” che permette di impostare fino a 500 giri automatici dei rulli, anche questa versione del gioco non prevede premi in free spin.\nLe funzioni e i bonus della slot\nBig Ghoulies è una slot molto semplice ma efficace, ideale per i giocatori meno esperti, alle prime armi o che preferiscono un gioco meno caotico. Questa slot machine si presenta con 5 rulli da 3 simboli ognuno e permette di giocare con un minimo di 5 linee di pagamento fino ad un massimo di 20 linee totali. Cliccando il pulsante “Bet” hai la possibilità di alzare o abbassare il valore della scommessa di ogni singolo spin. Il simbolo speciale con cui potrai partecipare al bonus stage è la Casa dell’orrore; il gioco bonus può essere attivato se compariranno 5 di questi simboli in qualsiasi posizione sui rulli. Una volta attivato avrai di fronte una grande e tetra casa con 20 finestre chiuse; accompagnato da scroscianti fulmini, potrai selezionare le finestre una per volta e ritirare il premio in denaro nascosto dietro di esse. Hai a tua disposizione tre vite. Il bonus stage termina quando, trovando dietro la finestra uno Scheletro, perderai tutte le vite. L’altro simbolo importante della slot, come già specificato, è la Donna Vampiro; essendo il simbolo Wild della slot ti aiuterà a completare al meglio le combinazioni vincenti.\nSlot simili a Big Ghoulies\nOltre alla precedente versione sviluppata dalla WMG, si trovano in commercio altre slot machine simili a Big Ghoulies. Esistono infatti altre slot che ricalcano le tematiche e l’ambientazione horror tipiche di questo gioco. Tra tutte troviamo, ad esempio, Witch Hunter sempre di casa WMG, House of Doom della Play’n Go, Wolf Hunters della Yggdrasil, Universal Monster: Phantom’s Curse della NetEnt e molte altre ancora.\n",

The symbols used in the game are a Vampire Woman, a Vampire, a green Gnome, a Halloween Pumpkin, Frankenstein, and a Horror House, which is the bonus symbol of the slot. Other classic symbols included in the game are a cluster of Cherries, a cluster of Grapes, a Lemon, and an Apple. The Vampire Woman is the slot's Wild symbol and helps to complete winning combinations.\n\nBonus stage\n\nThe bonus stage of Big Ghoulies is activated by getting 5 Horror House symbols in any position on the reels. The bonus game is set in a large and gloomy house with 20 closed windows that hide cash prizes.

This slot machine is inspired by the \"Haunted House\" film series; the game setting and all symbols refer to creatures of the night and typical monsters of horror representations. Music and sound effects are studied to create the most dark and malicious environment possible; screams and devilish laughter accompany the game, sending shivers down the spines of players!\nGraphics of the slot machine.\nThe strides made in this sector by software house WMG are even more evident thanks to this title. The new graphics presented for the renewed Big Ghoulies slot are the tangible proof of the steps forward made by this company. The animations are very fluid, and each of the symbols used has its own unique animation. As specified, all characters refer to the horror world. We have a Vampire Woman, also acting as the slot's Wild symbol, a Vampire, a green Gnome, a typical Halloween Pumpkin, Frankenstein, and a Horror House necessary to activate the game's Bonus stage. Together with these typically dark symbols, we find others with a more classic theme, such as a cluster of Cherries, a cluster of Grapes, a Lemon, and an Apple. You can play with the slot through the \"Autoplay\" mode, which allows you to set up to 500 automatic reel spins. Also, this version of the game does not provide prizes for free spins.\nFunctions and bonuses of the slot.\nBig Ghoulies is very simple but effective slot, ideal for less experienced players or those who prefer less chaotic games. This slot machine comes with 5 reels of 3 symbols each and allows you to play with a minimum of 5 pay lines up to a maximum of 20 total lines. By clicking the \"Bet\" button, you can raise or lower the bet value for each spin. The special symbol with which you can participate in the bonus stage is the Horror House. The bonus game can be activated if 5 of these symbols appear in any position on the reels. Once activated, you will face a large and gloomy house with 20 closed windows. Accompanied by thunderous lightning, you can select one window at a time and withdraw the hidden cash prize behind it. You have three lives at your disposal. The bonus stage ends when you find a Skeleton behind the window, losing all lives. The other important symbol of the slot, as already specified, is the Vampire Woman; being the Wild symbol of the slot, it will help you complete winning combinations.\nSlots similar to Big Ghoulies.\nIn addition to the previous version developed by WMG, there are other slot machines on the market similar to Big Ghoulies. In fact, there are other slots that follow the typical horror themes and settings of this game. Among all, we find, for example, Witch Hunter by WMG, House of Doom by Play'n Go, Wolf Hunters by Yggdrasil, Universal Monster: Phantom's Curse by NetEnt and many others.\n            ",

This slot machine is inspired by the \"Haunted House\" film series; the game setting and all symbols refer to creatures of the night and typical monsters of horror representations. Music and sound effects are studied to create the most dark and malicious environment possible; screams and devilish laughter accompany the game, sending shivers down the spines of players!\nGraphics of the slot machine.\nThe strides made in this sector by software house WMG are even more evident thanks to this title. The new graphics presented for the renewed Big Ghoulies slot are the tangible proof of the steps forward made by this company. The animations are very fluid, and each of the symbols used has its own unique animation. As specified, all characters refer to the horror world. We have a Vampire Woman, also acting as the slot's Wild symbol, a Vampire, a green Gnome, a typical Halloween Pumpkin, Frankenstein, and a Horror House necessary to activate the game's Bonus stage. Together with these typically dark symbols, we find others with a more classic theme, such as a cluster of Cherries, a cluster of Grapes, a Lemon, and an Apple. You can play with the slot through the \"Autoplay\" mode, which allows you to set up to 500 automatic reel spins. Also, this version of the game does not provide prizes for free spins.\nFunctions and bonuses of the slot.\nBig Ghoulies is very simple but effective slot, ideal for less experienced players or those who prefer less chaotic games. This slot machine comes with 5 reels of 3 symbols each and allows you to play with a minimum of 5 pay lines up to a maximum of 20 total lines. By clicking the \"Bet\" button, you can raise or lower the bet value for each spin. The special symbol with which you can participate in the bonus stage is the Horror House. The bonus game can be activated if 5 of these symbols appear in any position on the reels. Once activated, you will face a large and gloomy house with 20 closed windows. Accompanied by thunderous lightning, you can select one window at a time and withdraw the hidden cash prize behind it. You have three lives at your disposal. The bonus stage ends when you find a Skeleton behind the window, losing all lives. The other important symbol of the slot, as already specified, is the Vampire Woman; being the Wild symbol of the slot, it will help you complete winning combinations.\nSlots similar to Big Ghoulies.\nIn addition to the previous version developed by WMG, there are other slot machines on the market similar to Big Ghoulies. In fact, there are other slots that follow the typical horror themes and settings of this game. Among all, we find, for example, Witch Hunter by WMG, House of Doom by Play'n Go, Wolf Hunters by Yggdrasil, Universal Monster: Phantom's Curse by NetEnt and many others.\n            ",
