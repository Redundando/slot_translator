Pronti, via e ci troviamo su uno sfondo pulito, con una grafica che appare di ottima qualità. L’idea è di lasciare spazio e alla storia, ai guerrieri che possiamo ammirare e immaginare per questo tema.

Sullo schermo si alternano i simboli di Armature e Armi, che richiamano gladiatori affamati di successo. Ciò che però riesce a sorprenere, lasciando per un attimo da parte le componenti estetiche, è la scelta musicale. Il sonoro è qualcosa di geniale: si percepisce una vera sfida e il rischiamo a lottare per tutto ciò in cui crediamo. A livello di struttura la griglia di gioco è abbastanza classica, con i suoi 5 rulli e 3 file, oltre alle 20 linee di pagamento. Per sbloccare le tue vincite dovrai posizionare almeno 3 simboli uguali sul tabellone durante i giri e aspettare che si attivi la tua gustosissima ricompensa. Tieni sempre sotto controllo il guerriero con la lancia, che è il più fortunato tra i simboli base: permette di ottenere fino a 20 volte la tua scommessa. Anche se niente e nessuno potrà mai superare il Wild che arriva invece a 4.000 volte il valore della puntata effettuata.\nMa per alzare il valore della posta in palio il gamer deve provare la funzione Spartan Streak, che si attiva quando il cosiddetto Spartan Streak si presenta sui rulli durante il gameplay. Si può così espandere e far entrare ulteriori Wild che saranno poi fissi nel giri seguenti.\nLo Spartan Streak resta fisso anche se si avviano gli spin gratuiti che si possono attivare con un minimo di 3 simboli bonus. Il valore massimo dei giri è fissato a 100 Spin, che puoi così usare per continuare con i tuoi sogni di gloria.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Fortunes of Sparta\nSiamo alla fine di questo viaggio che ti aiuterà a scoprire una slot online non innovativa per tema e tecniche, ma interessante per modalità di gaming.

And it truly is. Our focus is on a digital machine created by Blueprint Games, a software house that specializes in historical themes, resurrecting the tradition of a more classic subject matter than some of the other titles it has released over the years. Ready, set, go, and we find ourselves on a clean background, with graphics that look of excellent quality. The idea is to make room for history, for the warriors we can admire and imagine within this theme. And this is where the player becomes a possible gladiator ready for anything, even to fight for their freedom, justice, or love. However, let's say that your personal battle is against luck, to try to snatch some interesting cash prizes.

Armors and weapons symbols alternate on the screen, calling up gladiators hungry for success.

The sound is brilliant: it conveys a real challenge, and the risk of fighting for everything we believe in. At the structural level, the game grid is quite classic, with its 5 reels and 3 rows, in addition to 20 pay lines. To unlock your winnings, you must place at least 3 identical symbols on the board during spins and wait for your delicious reward to activate. Always keep an eye on the warrior with the spear, as he is the luckiest among the base symbols: he can earn you up to 20 times your bet. Although nothing and no one can ever surpass the Wild symbol, which can reach up to 4,000 times the value of the wager made.\nBut to raise the stake's value, the gamer must try the Spartan Streak feature, which is activated when the so-called Spartan Streak appears on the reels during gameplay. in this way, you can expand and bring in additional Wild symbols that will then remain fixed in the following spins.\nThe Spartan Streak remains in place even if you start the free spins, which can be activated with a minimum of 3 bonus symbols.

The bonus games and features are good, the animations are interesting, and the sound effects are excellent as well. Do you still have any doubts?

And it truly is. Our focus is on a digital machine created by Blueprint Games, a software house that specializes in historical themes, resurrecting the tradition of a more classic subject matter than some of the other titles it has released over the years. Ready, set, go, and we find ourselves on a clean background, with graphics that look of excellent quality. The idea is to make room for history, for the warriors we can admire and imagine within this theme. And this is where the player becomes a possible gladiator ready for anything, even to fight for their freedom, justice, or love. However, let's say that your personal battle is against luck, to try to snatch some interesting cash prizes. Are you ready to don your armor and take to the field?\nGraphics and Symbols\nThe sound choice, symbols, and everything else, evoke the beauty of a plot that is away from us but is perceived as timeless. Armors and weapons symbols alternate on the screen, calling up gladiators hungry for success. However, leaving the aesthetic components aside for a moment, one thing manages to surprise us: the music. The sound is brilliant: it conveys a real challenge, and the risk of fighting for everything we believe in. At the structural level, the game grid is quite classic, with its 5 reels and 3 rows, in addition to 20 pay lines. To unlock your winnings, you must place at least 3 identical symbols on the board during spins and wait for your delicious reward to activate. Always keep an eye on the warrior with the spear, as he is the luckiest among the base symbols: he can earn you up to 20 times your bet. Although nothing and no one can ever surpass the Wild symbol, which can reach up to 4,000 times the value of the wager made.\nBut to raise the stake's value, the gamer must try the Spartan Streak feature, which is activated when the so-called Spartan Streak appears on the reels during gameplay. in this way, you can expand and bring in additional Wild symbols that will then remain fixed in the following spins.\nThe Spartan Streak remains in place even if you start the free spins, which can be activated with a minimum of 3 bonus symbols.
