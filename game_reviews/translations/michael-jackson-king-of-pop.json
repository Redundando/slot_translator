At first, he was the undisputed star of the Jackson Five, a group formed with his brothers, and only later he began his solo career. From there on, it was a success after another. The second album, Thriller, was recognized as one of the most influential pop music records, staying in the charts for 37 weeks and selling millions of copies. What made Jackson an immortal artist was not only his singing, but also the dances that accompany his performances, such as the moonwalk, imitated all over the world.\n\nTo pay homage in the best possible way to such an important personality, Bally has created a slot machine that draws heavily from Michael's universe, with the game grid crossed by disco-colorful lights in full 80s style and a soundtrack that ranges from Dirty Diana to Beat It and Smooth Criminal.\n\nSlot Features\nThe game grid has five reels and three rows and 25 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is set at €0.40, but can be raised at will.\n\nWith the Autoplay mode, you can select a number of spins between 10 and 200, including some win and loss limits beyond which the game will stop, returning to manual mode.\n\nTo win, you must match identical symbols from left to right (except for Scatters) on an active payline. In case of multiple winning combinations, only the highest one will be paid.\n\nThe volatility is medium, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is a good 96.01%.\n\nMoonwalk Bonus and other features\nThe symbols worth the most in Michael Jackson King of Pop all refer to the world of the American artist. The classic playing cards that are good for a royal flush are worth less, followed by raised feet on tiptoe, glasses, hat, and silver glove.\n\nThere are also different types of Wilds with different functions, such as Moonwalk Wild or stacked Wilds.\n\nThe Bonus lettering is our Scatter: three of these will bring up a wheel divided into segments, spinning it, you can win Free Spins, coins or multipliers.\n\nWe have two types of Free Spins:\n\n- Beat it Free Games: you get ten free spins and blocked Wilds during the entire function.\n- Smooth Criminal Free Games: here we get five free spins during which the various reels turn into Wilds. In the first spin, the fifth reel becomes a wild card; in the second, the fourth reel will also be added, and so on, until all the others.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I try the game before betting real money?\n\nCertainly, the demo version is available on our website.\n\nWhat is the volatility of the slot?\n\nMichael Jackson King of Pop has a medium volatility, meaning we have a decent frequency of wins and respectable prizes.\n\nWhere can I play Michael Jackson King of Pop?\n\nOn the major Italian casinos provided with AAMS certification.",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame features and bonuses\nGraphics and sound effects\nCompatibility and accessibility\nPayouts and RTP\nOverall gameplay experience\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Michael Jackson King of Pop\nA legendary star, the King of Pop and eternal Peter Pan, are just two of the nicknames that have made one of the most important figures in the entire music scene famous. At first, he was the undisputed star of the Jackson Five, a group formed with his brothers, and only later he began his solo career. From there on, it was a success after another. The second album, Thriller, was recognized as one of the most influential pop music records, staying in the charts for 37 weeks and selling millions of copies. What made Jackson an immortal artist was not only his singing, but also the dances that accompany his performances, such as the moonwalk, imitated all over the world.\n\nTo pay homage in the best possible way to such an important personality, Bally has created a slot machine that draws heavily from Michael's universe, with the game grid crossed by disco-colorful lights in full 80s style and a soundtrack that ranges from Dirty Diana to Beat It and Smooth Criminal.\n\nSlot Features\nThe game grid has five reels and three rows and 25 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is set at €0.40, but can be raised at will.\n\nWith the Autoplay mode, you can select a number of spins between 10 and 200, including some win and loss limits beyond which the game will stop, returning to manual mode.\n\nTo win, you must match identical symbols from left to right (except for Scatters) on an active payline. In case of multiple winning combinations, only the highest one will be paid.\n\nThe volatility is medium, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is a good 96.01%.\n\nMoonwalk Bonus and other features\nThe symbols worth the most in Michael Jackson King of Pop all refer to the world of the American artist. The classic playing cards that are good for a royal flush are worth less, followed by raised feet on tiptoe, glasses, hat, and silver glove.\n\nThere are also different types of Wilds with different functions, such as Moonwalk Wild or stacked Wilds.\n\nThe Bonus lettering is our Scatter: three of these will bring up a wheel divided into segments, spinning it, you can win Free Spins, coins or multipliers.\n\nWe have two types of Free Spins:\n\n- Beat it Free Games: you get ten free spins and blocked Wilds during the entire function.\n- Smooth Criminal Free Games: here we get five free spins during which the various reels turn into Wilds. In the first spin, the fifth reel becomes a wild card; in the second, the fourth reel will also be added, and so on, until all the others.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I try the game before betting real money?\n\nCertainly, the demo version is available on our website.\n\nWhat is the volatility of the slot?\n\nMichael Jackson King of Pop has a medium volatility, meaning we have a decent frequency of wins and respectable prizes.\n\nWhere can I play Michael Jackson King of Pop?\n\nOn the major Italian casinos provided with AAMS certification.\n            ",

The second album, Thriller, was recognized as one of the most influential pop music records, staying in the charts for 37 weeks and selling millions of copies. What made Jackson an immortal artist was not only his singing, but also the dances that accompany his performances, such as the moonwalk, imitated all over the world.\n\nTo pay homage in the best possible way to such an important personality, Bally has created a slot machine that draws heavily from Michael's universe, with the game grid crossed by disco-colorful lights in full 80s style and a soundtrack that ranges from Dirty Diana to Beat It and Smooth Criminal.\n\nSlot Features\nThe game grid has five reels and three rows and 25 fixed paylines.

At first, he was the undisputed star of the Jackson Five, a group formed with his brothers, and only later he began his solo career. From there on, it was a success after another. The second album, Thriller, was recognized as one of the most influential pop music records, staying in the charts for 37 weeks and selling millions of copies. What made Jackson an immortal artist was not only his singing, but also the dances that accompany his performances, such as the moonwalk, imitated all over the world.\n\nTo pay homage in the best possible way to such an important personality, Bally has created a slot machine that draws heavily from Michael's universe, with the game grid crossed by disco-colorful lights in full 80s style and a soundtrack that ranges from Dirty Diana to Beat It and Smooth Criminal.\n\nSlot Features\nThe game grid has five reels and three rows and 25 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is set at €0.40, but can be raised at will.\n\nWith the Autoplay mode, you can select a number of spins between 10 and 200, including some win and loss limits beyond which the game will stop, returning to manual mode.\n\nTo win, you must match identical symbols from left to right (except for Scatters) on an active payline. In case of multiple winning combinations, only the highest one will be paid.\n\nThe volatility is medium, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is a good 96.01%.\n\nMoonwalk Bonus and other features\nThe symbols worth the most in Michael Jackson King of Pop all refer to the world of the American artist. The classic playing cards that are good for a royal flush are worth less, followed by raised feet on tiptoe, glasses, hat, and silver glove.\n\nThere are also different types of Wilds with different functions, such as Moonwalk Wild or stacked Wilds.\n\nThe Bonus lettering is our Scatter: three of these will bring up a wheel divided into segments, spinning it, you can win Free Spins, coins or multipliers.\n\nWe have two types of Free Spins:\n\n- Beat it Free Games: you get ten free spins and blocked Wilds during the entire function.\n- Smooth Criminal Free Games: here we get five free spins during which the various reels turn into Wilds. In the first spin, the fifth reel becomes a wild card; in the second, the fourth reel will also be added, and so on, until all the others.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I try the game before betting real money?\n\nCertainly, the demo version is available on our website.\n\nWhat is the volatility of the slot?\n\nMichael Jackson King of Pop has a medium volatility, meaning we have a decent frequency of wins and respectable prizes.\n\nWhere can I play Michael Jackson King of Pop?\n\nOn the major Italian casinos provided with AAMS certification.\n        ",
