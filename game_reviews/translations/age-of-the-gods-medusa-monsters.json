The slot, which enriches the saga of Age of the Gods, has 6 reels and a total of 164 ways to win, and it features a very lucky function, Medusa's Gaze, which fixes a symbol chosen by the player on the grid while Medusa moves as a wild symbol among the reels. For every spin, it is possible to achieve a dream win to use in the base game. But let's take a closer look at what the enchanting Medusa can offer with its 4 progressive jackpots up for grabs!\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nLet's get straight to the point: graphics-wise, this is not one of Playtech's best slots. It has a retro style that may not appeal to everyone, although its animations are still cute. So it seems that the software house preferred to focus on the features and bonus games of the online machine, without delving into the graphic structure.\n\nAs its name suggests, the slot is based on a well-known female Greek mythological character, the beautiful Medusa with venomous live snakes as hair. This symbol is that of an expanding Wild that stacks on every reel it appears, offering free spins and even rich winnings. In the background, we can admire a rocky location surrounded by the sea, the ocean, and a series of characters that enrich the story. We find 4 different precious stones, Helmets, Swords, and Boats, which leave room for more important icons (in value) such as Cerberus, the three-headed dog, the Minotaur, and the beautiful Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of beauty and love. This latter is the richest symbol, capable of guaranteeing 150 coins if it appears 6 times on a payline. Medusa is our Wild that can replace any symbol and increase the chances of winning: it is essential in the Gaze feature. If you activate this bonus game, you are projected onto a new screen where you choose your lucky symbol among three shields. At that point, the spins begin, and Medusa will go to block the chosen symbol on the reels: this generates a series of fortunate winnings that will last until the protagonist finishes moving on the reels, from six to one.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Age of the Gods: Medusa & Monsters slot\nAge of the Gods Medusa & Monsters, with its 96.09% RTP and high volatility, is definitely a machine that can give great satisfaction.

Age of the Gods Medusa & Monsters is an interesting playing field not only for its graphics but also for the high chances of winning it offers to players with good patience and a willingness to take risks. The slot, which enriches the saga of Age of the Gods, has 6 reels and a total of 164 ways to win, and it features a very lucky function, Medusa's Gaze, which fixes a symbol chosen by the player on the grid while Medusa moves as a wild symbol among the reels. For every spin, it is possible to achieve a dream win to use in the base game. But let's take a closer look at what the enchanting Medusa can offer with its 4 progressive jackpots up for grabs!\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nLet's get straight to the point: graphics-wise, this is not one of Playtech's best slots. It has a retro style that may not appeal to everyone, although its animations are still cute. So it seems that the software house preferred to focus on the features and bonus games of the online machine, without delving into the graphic structure.\n\nAs its name suggests, the slot is based on a well-known female Greek mythological character, the beautiful Medusa with venomous live snakes as hair. This symbol is that of an expanding Wild that stacks on every reel it appears, offering free spins and even rich winnings. In the background, we can admire a rocky location surrounded by the sea, the ocean, and a series of characters that enrich the story. We find 4 different precious stones, Helmets, Swords, and Boats, which leave room for more important icons (in value) such as Cerberus, the three-headed dog, the Minotaur, and the beautiful Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of beauty and love. This latter is the richest symbol, capable of guaranteeing 150 coins if it appears 6 times on a payline. Medusa is our Wild that can replace any symbol and increase the chances of winning: it is essential in the Gaze feature. If you activate this bonus game, you are projected onto a new screen where you choose your lucky symbol among three shields. At that point, the spins begin, and Medusa will go to block the chosen symbol on the reels: this generates a series of fortunate winnings that will last until the protagonist finishes moving on the reels, from six to one.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Age of the Gods: Medusa & Monsters slot\nAge of the Gods Medusa & Monsters, with its 96.09% RTP and high volatility, is definitely a machine that can give great satisfaction. Not so much in its base game, but through its special features and thanks to the 4 progressive jackpots that are activated randomly. It is a game accessible to everyone, both for experienced gamers and beginners: no one will be able to resist the charm of Medusa.\n            ",

Age of the Gods Medusa & Monsters is an interesting playing field not only for its graphics but also for the high chances of winning it offers to players with good patience and a willingness to take risks. The slot, which enriches the saga of Age of the Gods, has 6 reels and a total of 164 ways to win, and it features a very lucky function, Medusa's Gaze, which fixes a symbol chosen by the player on the grid while Medusa moves as a wild symbol among the reels. For every spin, it is possible to achieve a dream win to use in the base game. But let's take a closer look at what the enchanting Medusa can offer with its 4 progressive jackpots up for grabs!\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nLet's get straight to the point: graphics-wise, this is not one of Playtech's best slots. It has a retro style that may not appeal to everyone, although its animations are still cute. So it seems that the software house preferred to focus on the features and bonus games of the online machine, without delving into the graphic structure.\n\nAs its name suggests, the slot is based on a well-known female Greek mythological character, the beautiful Medusa with venomous live snakes as hair. This symbol is that of an expanding Wild that stacks on every reel it appears, offering free spins and even rich winnings. In the background, we can admire a rocky location surrounded by the sea, the ocean, and a series of characters that enrich the story. We find 4 different precious stones, Helmets, Swords, and Boats, which leave room for more important icons (in value) such as Cerberus, the three-headed dog, the Minotaur, and the beautiful Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of beauty and love. This latter is the richest symbol, capable of guaranteeing 150 coins if it appears 6 times on a payline. Medusa is our Wild that can replace any symbol and increase the chances of winning: it is essential in the Gaze feature. If you activate this bonus game, you are projected onto a new screen where you choose your lucky symbol among three shields. At that point, the spins begin, and Medusa will go to block the chosen symbol on the reels: this generates a series of fortunate winnings that will last until the protagonist finishes moving on the reels, from six to one.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Age of the Gods: Medusa & Monsters slot\nAge of the Gods Medusa & Monsters, with its 96.09% RTP and high volatility, is definitely a machine that can give great satisfaction. Not so much in its base game, but through its special features and thanks to the 4 progressive jackpots that are activated randomly. It is a game accessible to everyone, both for experienced gamers and beginners: no one will be able to resist the charm of Medusa.\n            ",

So it seems that the software house preferred to focus on the features and bonus games of the online machine, without delving into the graphic structure.\n\nAs its name suggests, the slot is based on a well-known female Greek mythological character, the beautiful Medusa with venomous live snakes as hair. This symbol is that of an expanding Wild that stacks on every reel it appears, offering free spins and even rich winnings. In the background, we can admire a rocky location surrounded by the sea, the ocean, and a series of characters that enrich the story. We find 4 different precious stones, Helmets, Swords, and Boats, which leave room for more important icons (in value) such as Cerberus, the three-headed dog, the Minotaur, and the beautiful Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of beauty and love. This latter is the richest symbol, capable of guaranteeing 150 coins if it appears 6 times on a payline. Medusa is our Wild that can replace any symbol and increase the chances of winning: it is essential in the Gaze feature. If you activate this bonus game, you are projected onto a new screen where you choose your lucky symbol among three shields. At that point, the spins begin, and Medusa will go to block the chosen symbol on the reels: this generates a series of fortunate winnings that will last until the protagonist finishes moving on the reels, from six to one.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Age of the Gods: Medusa & Monsters slot\nAge of the Gods Medusa & Monsters, with its 96.09% RTP and high volatility, is definitely a machine that can give great satisfaction. Not so much in its base game, but through its special features and thanks to the 4 progressive jackpots that are activated randomly. It is a game accessible to everyone, both for experienced gamers and beginners: no one will be able to resist the charm of Medusa.\n            ",

Age of the Gods Medusa & Monsters is an interesting playing field not only for its graphics but also for the high chances of winning it offers to players with good patience and a willingness to take risks. The slot, which enriches the saga of Age of the Gods, has 6 reels and a total of 164 ways to win, and it features a very lucky function, Medusa's Gaze, which fixes a symbol chosen by the player on the grid while Medusa moves as a wild symbol among the reels.
