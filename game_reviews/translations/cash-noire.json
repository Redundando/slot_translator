La vincita più alta a cui si può ambire è pari a 5.000 volte la puntata, mentre l’RTP si attesta su un più che soddisfacente 96,06 % e si può giocare a partire da soli 20 centesimi per giro.\nPer quanto riguarda la struttura di gioco, questa è abbastanza tradizionale, con cinque rulli, quattro righe e ben 1.024 linee di pagamento.\nSimboli e funzionalità speciali di Cash Noire\nLa NetEnt ha fatto in modo che questo gioco sia strutturato proprio come una sorta di romanzo, con un filo che lega le varie funzionalità in una trama comune.\nI simboli che si alternano sui rulli di Cash Noire sono interamente tematici e includono, tra gli altri, il detective, due bellissime donne, pistola e proiettili, il gangster, una scatola di fiammiferi e una lente d’ingrandimento.\nCiò che rende interessante il gioco sono le varie funzionalità, a partire dal sistema di gioco chiamato “Avalanche”: i simboli che hanno determinato una combinazione vincente vengono spazzati via dai rulli e sostituiti da una cascata di altre icone.\nTra le altre funzioni , ricordiamo quella free spins, che regala dei giri gratuiti, e alcune special features, tra le quali la Mystery Symbols.\n",

The game's theme is inspired by the world of crime fiction, with a background that is a true crime scene, featuring criminals, investigators and of course, the ever-present femmes fatales. The initial screen of Cash Noire opens with the enigmatic face of an investigator, immersed in an urban scenario with dreary outlines, illuminated by neon lights that make the scene very suggestive and eerie.\n\nThe game screen features the same dark colors, and the symbols alternated on the reels are reproduced while maintaining the style and atmosphere of the theme. NetEnt's slot machines have always stood out for their particularly well-crafted graphic compartments, and even in the case of Cash Noire, the sharpness and realism of the images, combined with a skilled use of colors, immerse the player in a seedy Los Angeles in the company of guards and thieves.

This NetEnt slot machine could easily be defined as \"a slot for everyone,\" whether you are an experienced player or are just entering the world of spinning reels. Cash Noire has a very easy and intuitive gameplay, with low volatility that guarantees constant prizes, albeit not too high, and supported by an elegant graphic design.

It has low volatility which guarantees frequent wins, albeit not too high. The game's structure is quite traditional with five reels, four rows, and 1,024 paylines.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics of Cash Noire are one of its highlights. It features a dark and moody theme inspired by the world of crime fiction. The imagery is well-crafted, realistic, and sharp, immersing the players in a seedy Los Angeles environment. The urban scenes are illuminated by neon lights, creating an eerie atmosphere that is suggestive and immersive. The symbols and the game screen feature dark colors that convey the game's theme perfectly.\n\nPayouts\n\nThe highest possible win in Cash Noire is 5,000 times the bet, and the return to player (RTP) is 96.06%. The low volatility of the game ensures that the player gets frequent payouts, although not high. It is a game suitable for those looking for a casual and relaxing spinning experience rather than winning a substantial sum of money.\n\nFeatures\n\nCash Noire has various functionalities making it an engaging and exciting game. The game system called 'Avalanche' sweeps away the symbols that formed a winning combination and replaces them with a cascade of other icons. The free spins feature gives out free spins, while the Mystery Symbols feature increases the player's chances of winning. The game has a thread that links the various features together in a common plot, and the symbols are entirely thematic.\n\nPaylines\n\nCash Noire has 1,024 ways to win, the paylines of the game. It means that winning combinations can appear anywhere on adjacent reels, rather than on specific lines. It adds to the game's overall simplicity and easy-to-understand gameplay. The symbols such as the detective, two women, the gangster, gun and bullets, a box of matches, and a magnifying glass all play a part in forming winning combinations and adding to the game's overall thematic experience.\n\n        \n            ",

The game's theme is inspired by the world of crime fiction, with a background that is a true crime scene, featuring criminals, investigators and of course, the ever-present femmes fatales. The initial screen of Cash Noire opens with the enigmatic face of an investigator, immersed in an urban scenario with dreary outlines, illuminated by neon lights that make the scene very suggestive and eerie.\n\nThe game screen features the same dark colors, and the symbols alternated on the reels are reproduced while maintaining the style and atmosphere of the theme. NetEnt's slot machines have always stood out for their particularly well-crafted graphic compartments, and even in the case of Cash Noire, the sharpness and realism of the images, combined with a skilled use of colors, immerse the player in a seedy Los Angeles in the company of guards and thieves. It is a gaming experience that we are certain will hold you glued to the screen.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nLet's be clear, if you are looking for a highly elaborate slot, characterized by high volatility and the chance to obtain stellar jackpots, Cash Noire may not be the game for you. This NetEnt slot machine could easily be defined as \"a slot for everyone,\" whether you are an experienced player or are just entering the world of spinning reels. Cash Noire has a very easy and intuitive gameplay, with low volatility that guarantees constant prizes, albeit not too high, and supported by an elegant graphic design. The highest possible win is 5,000 times the bet, while the RTP is a more than satisfactory 96.06%, and you can play starting from just 20 cents per spin.\n\nAs for the game structure, it is quite traditional, with five reels, four rows, and well, 1,024 paylines. The symbols that alternate on the reels of Cash Noire are entirely thematic and include, among others, the detective, two beautiful women, a gun and bullets, the gangster, a box of matches, and a magnifying glass.\n\nSymbols and special features of Cash Noire\nNetEnt has structured this game just like a sort of novel, with a thread that links the various functions into a common plot. The symbols that alternate on the reels of Cash Noire are entirely thematic and include, among others, the detective, two beautiful women, a gun and bullets, the gangster, a box of matches, and a magnifying glass.\n\nWhat makes the game interesting are the various functionalities, starting from the game system called \"Avalanche\": the symbols that have determined a winning combination are swept away from the reels and replaced by a cascade of other icons. Among the other features, we recall the free spins function, which gives out free spins, and some special features, such as the Mystery Symbols.\n            ",

The game's theme is inspired by the world of crime fiction, with a background that is a true crime scene, featuring criminals, investigators and of course, the ever-present femmes fatales. The initial screen of Cash Noire opens with the enigmatic face of an investigator, immersed in an urban scenario with dreary outlines, illuminated by neon lights that make the scene very suggestive and eerie.\n\nThe game screen features the same dark colors, and the symbols alternated on the reels are reproduced while maintaining the style and atmosphere of the theme. NetEnt's slot machines have always stood out for their particularly well-crafted graphic compartments, and even in the case of Cash Noire, the sharpness and realism of the images, combined with a skilled use of colors, immerse the player in a seedy Los Angeles in the company of guards and thieves. It is a gaming experience that we are certain will hold you glued to the screen.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nLet's be clear, if you are looking for a highly elaborate slot, characterized by high volatility and the chance to obtain stellar jackpots, Cash Noire may not be the game for you. This NetEnt slot machine could easily be defined as \"a slot for everyone,\" whether you are an experienced player or are just entering the world of spinning reels. Cash Noire has a very easy and intuitive gameplay, with low volatility that guarantees constant prizes, albeit not too high, and supported by an elegant graphic design. The highest possible win is 5,000 times the bet, while the RTP is a more than satisfactory 96.06%, and you can play starting from just 20 cents per spin.\n\nAs for the game structure, it is quite traditional, with five reels, four rows, and well, 1,024 paylines. The symbols that alternate on the reels of Cash Noire are entirely thematic and include, among others, the detective, two beautiful women, a gun and bullets, the gangster, a box of matches, and a magnifying glass.\n\nSymbols and special features of Cash Noire\nNetEnt has structured this game just like a sort of novel, with a thread that links the various functions into a common plot. The symbols that alternate on the reels of Cash Noire are entirely thematic and include, among others, the detective, two beautiful women, a gun and bullets, the gangster, a box of matches, and a magnifying glass.\n\nWhat makes the game interesting are the various functionalities, starting from the game system called \"Avalanche\": the symbols that have determined a winning combination are swept away from the reels and replaced by a cascade of other icons. Among the other features, we recall the free spins function, which gives out free spins, and some special features, such as the Mystery Symbols.\n        ",
