The RTP is 94.59%, which is lower than the market average, and has average volatility. The game includes a Wild symbol that can replace all others, along with Scatter symbols that activate bonus modes. The magician himself also acts as a symbol, transforming reels into Wild symbols when three of them appear on the screen.\n\nOverall, Magic Rewards is an entertaining and unique slot game that offers some exciting features. If you enjoy the theme of magic in slots, there are other titles you might want to check out, such as It's Magic by IGT, Magic Fruits Deluxe by Wazdan and Magic Wilds by Red Rake.\n        ",

Ainsworth's Magic Rewards takes a very different direction: we move to the stage of a provincial theater to discover the tricks of a mustached illusionist with impeccable hair.\n\nIn this review, we will talk about the graphic and sound aspects, as well as the gameplay mechanics, in order to offer you a window into this decidedly original title. \n\nMagic Rewards - Watch out for the sounds \n\nAfter our first start of Magic Rewards, we were greeted by silence as the sound was turned off by default. This may be a good thing, as there is no music inside the game (except for a short jingle after a win) and the sounds of the various plays tend to be very loud for the standards of the various online slots, so... be careful with your headphones!\n\nThe game grid is set within the curtain, with the title at the top accompanied by two batons from which two doves come out at regular intervals, while the magician himself is at the bottom of the screen and looks towards the player. The various symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q...) accompany the baton, the rabbit in the cylinder, and other classic elements of a magic show.\n\nMagic Rewards - Gameplay mechanics \n\nFrom a technical point of view, the slot is a 5x3 type and shows fifteen symbols at each play. The RTP is 94.59%, a value a bit low compared to the market average that usually shows slots on 96/97% and has an average volatility. Among the various symbols to which we will pay attention, we certainly find the Wild symbol, which can act as a wild card and replace all the others in the game, and the magic wand, a Scatter symbol that allows access to the bonus mode by finding at least three at the same time.\n\nDuring the free spins, the number of which is determined by the number of Scatter symbols we found at the start, the central reel will be occupied by a drape that will hide three symbols that will then be revealed later. By finding at least two wands again, we will get additional free spins. The magician becomes a symbol: every time he appears, he will transform one of the reels into Wild symbols, starting from the one where he is (finding three of them will make all the reels Wild).\n\nThe prizes obviously depend on how much the player bets, but based on our experience, it seems that the slot prefers to dispense more bonus modes but of lower value. \n\nSimilar slots to Magic Rewards \n\nIf we have come to this Ainsworth slot because we are interested in magic, then there are many other titles that analyze this theme from various angles, such as It's Magic by IGT, Magic Fruits Deluxe by Wazdan, and Magic Wilds by Red Rake.\n            ",

With an RTP of 94.59%, the game's volatility is average. The Wild symbol, represented by the magician, substitutes for all other symbols except the Scatter symbol. If the player finds at least three Scatter symbols, represented by a magic wand, they enter the bonus mode where they can earn free spins. During the free spins, the middle reel is covered by a drape, revealing three symbols when the drape is released. The player can earn additional free spins by finding at least two Scatter symbols. The magician symbol can also transform regular symbols into Wild symbols, with the potential to turn all reels Wild with three magician symbols.\n\nGame design and graphics\n\nMagic Rewards has a unique design that places players in a provincial theater to witness a magical performance. The reel grid is set within a curtain, and the magician himself is at the bottom of the screen looking towards the player. Classic magic show elements, like playing cards, a rabbit in a cylinder, and a magic wand, are also present. The lack of in-game music may be a drawback for some players, and the sound effects can be loud. The graphics are of good quality, and the design is immersive.\n\nBonus features\n\nThe bonus mode in Magic Rewards is triggered by finding at least three Scatter symbols, represented by a magic wand. During the free spins mode, the middle reel is covered in a drape and reveals three symbols once the drape is lifted. The Magician symbol can also transform regular symbols into Wild symbols, with the potential to turn all reels Wild with three Magician symbols. The feature allows players to earn additional free spins by finding at least two Scatter symbols. The bonus mode occurs frequently, but the rewards tend to be lower in value than in some other slot games.\n\nSimilar games\n\nFor players interested in the magic theme, there are other titles worth considering, such as It's Magic by IGT, Magic Fruits Deluxe by Wazdan, and Magic Wilds by Red Rake.\n\nReturn to Player and volatility\n\nMagic Rewards has an RTP of 94.59%, which is lower than the average in the market. The slot has an average volatility, which means wins occur moderately but with a varying degree of risk involved. The game is more generous with the bonus mode, with lower rewards than in some other slots, which may appeal to players looking for frequent bonus action.\n\n        \n            ",

However, it stands out from other magic-themed slots, as it takes players to the stage of a provincial theater, where they discover the tricks of an illusionist.\n\nGraphics and Sound Effects\n\nMagic Rewards has a unique design, with the game grid set within the stage curtain and the magician himself at the bottom of the screen. The symbols of playing cards, batons, rabbits in a cylinder, and other classic elements of magic shows adorn the reels. However, the music inside the game is minimal, and the sounds of the various plays tend to be very loud for the standards of other online slots.\n\nGameplay Technicalities\n\nMagic Rewards is a 5x3 slot type and shows fifteen symbols at each play. The RTP is 94.59%, which is relatively low compared to the market average. The slot has an average volatility and features a Wild symbol that can act as a wild card and replace all the others in the game, and the magic wand, a Scatter symbol that allows access to the bonus mode when there are at least three at the same time. During the free spins, the central reel will be occupied by a drape, and by finding at least two wands again, the player will get additional free spins. The magician becomes a symbol and will transform one of the reels into Wild symbols every time he appears.\n\nSpecial Symbols and Features\n\nOne of the most important symbols in Magic Rewards is the Wild symbol, which can replace all symbols in the game except the Scatter symbol. The Scatter symbol is the magic wand, which can trigger the bonus round. During the bonus round, the central reel is covered by a drape, and finding at least two wands will allow players to get additional free spins. The magician symbol, when it appears, can transform one of the reels into Wild symbols. Finding three magician symbols will make all the reels Wild.\n\nComparison to Other Magic-Themed Slots\n\nThere are many other magic-themed slots in the market such as It's Magic by IGT, Magic Fruits Deluxe by Wazdan, and Magic Wilds by Red Rake. However, Magic Rewards distinguishes itself from them with its focus on illusionism and theatrical performances. Although the RTP of Magic Reward is lower than average, it frequently dispenses bonus modes but of lower value.\n\n        \n            ",

This may be a good thing, as there is no music inside the game (except for a short jingle after a win) and the sounds of the various plays tend to be very loud for the standards of the various online slots, so... be careful with your headphones!\n\nThe game grid is set within the curtain, with the title at the top accompanied by two batons from which two doves come out at regular intervals, while the magician himself is at the bottom of the screen and looks towards the player.

Ainsworth's Magic Rewards takes a very different direction: we move to the stage of a provincial theater to discover the tricks of a mustached illusionist with impeccable hair.\n\nIn this review, we will talk about the graphic and sound aspects, as well as the gameplay mechanics, in order to offer you a window into this decidedly original title. \n\nMagic Rewards - Watch out for the sounds \n\nAfter our first start of Magic Rewards, we were greeted by silence as the sound was turned off by default. This may be a good thing, as there is no music inside the game (except for a short jingle after a win) and the sounds of the various plays tend to be very loud for the standards of the various online slots, so... be careful with your headphones!\n\nThe game grid is set within the curtain, with the title at the top accompanied by two batons from which two doves come out at regular intervals, while the magician himself is at the bottom of the screen and looks towards the player. The various symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q...) accompany the baton, the rabbit in the cylinder, and other classic elements of a magic show.\n\nMagic Rewards - Gameplay mechanics \n\nFrom a technical point of view, the slot is a 5x3 type and shows fifteen symbols at each play. The RTP is 94.59%, a value a bit low compared to the market average that usually shows slots on 96/97% and has an average volatility. Among the various symbols to which we will pay attention, we certainly find the Wild symbol, which can act as a wild card and replace all the others in the game, and the magic wand, a Scatter symbol that allows access to the bonus mode by finding at least three at the same time.\n\nDuring the free spins, the number of which is determined by the number of Scatter symbols we found at the start, the central reel will be occupied by a drape that will hide three symbols that will then be revealed later. By finding at least two wands again, we will get additional free spins. The magician becomes a symbol: every time he appears, he will transform one of the reels into Wild symbols, starting from the one where he is (finding three of them will make all the reels Wild).\n\nThe prizes obviously depend on how much the player bets, but based on our experience, it seems that the slot prefers to dispense more bonus modes but of lower value. \n\nSimilar slots to Magic Rewards \n\nIf we have come to this Ainsworth slot because we are interested in magic, then there are many other titles that analyze this theme from various angles, such as It's Magic by IGT, Magic Fruits Deluxe by Wazdan, and Magic Wilds by Red Rake.\n        ",
