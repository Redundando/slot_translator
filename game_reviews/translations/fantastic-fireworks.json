Explosions can trigger special fireworks that remain until they explode, potentially leading to massive payouts. Fill up the Rocket Meter to trigger one of two bonus features: the Free Spins Bonus or the Cannon Bonus. \n\nVisuals and design\n\nFantastic Fireworks! has a cartoon-style design set against a city at night backdrop. Symbols on the reels include various fireworks characters. Chains of 3 or more symbols trigger explosions and new symbols to potentially win again and again. Longer and intersecting chains can create special fireworks, which remain on the reels until they explode.\n\nBonus features and rewards\n\nFantastic Fireworks! is a high-variance game with an RTP of 97%. The goal is to collect 9 different symbols and play up to 5 paylines to unlock the ultimate phase of the game. Each explosion results in a win, with payouts ranging from 1 to 10 times your bet. Fantastic Fireworks! also features floating reels, where symbols float and replace exploded symbols for even more chances to win. Collect 20 Sparkler symbols or just one Rocket Bonus symbol in the Rocket Bonus Meter to activate one of two bonus features.\n\nThe Free Spins Bonus rewards you with 8 initial free spins, and special symbols appear on every single free spin. Look out for Sparkler symbols, as every 10 free spins trigger an additional 4 free spins. The Cannon Bonus feature requires you to choose 3 cannons, each of which reveals a cash prize. Any chosen cannon can also spark another cannon for more cash prizes.\n\nSimilar games to try\n\nIf you enjoy Fantastic Fireworks!, you might also enjoy Fireworks Master by Playson.

While others brave the cold November nights to watch real fireworks, you can enjoy the colorful explosions from the comfort of your home, with the chance to win big money! This IGT-powered game features explosive graphics and is played on a 5x5 grid with 10 paylines. With explosive wins, you can create special fireworks that remain until they explode, potentially lighting up your sky with massive payouts. Fill up the Rocket Meter to trigger one of two bonus features: the Free Spins Bonus or the Cannon Bonus. \n\nVisually, Fantastic Fireworks! has a cartoon style and is set against the backdrop of a city at night. The symbols on the reels include a variety of fireworks characters, and creating chains of 3 or more symbols triggers explosions and new symbols to potentially win again and again. Longer chains and intersecting chains create special fireworks, which remain on the reels until they explode. \n\nThis high-variance game has an RTP of 97%. The goal is to collect 9 different symbols and play up to 5 paylines to unlock the ultimate phase of the game. Each explosion results in a win, with payouts ranging from 1 to 10 times your bet. Fantastic Fireworks! also features floating reels, where symbols float and replace exploded symbols for even more chances to win. Collect 20 Sparkler symbols or just one Rocket Bonus symbol in the Rocket Bonus Meter to activate one of two bonus features. \n\nThe Free Spins Bonus rewards you with 8 initial free spins, and special symbols appear on every single free spin. Keep an eye out for Sparkler symbols, as every 10 free spins trigger an additional 4 free spins. The Cannon Bonus feature requires you to choose 3 cannons, each of which reveals a cash prize. Any chosen cannon can also spark another cannon for more cash prizes. \n\nIf you enjoy Fantastic Fireworks!, you might also enjoy Fireworks Master by Playson, featuring 243 paylines for explosive payouts. Don't miss your chance to light up the sky with Fantastic Fireworks! and potentially win some big money!\n        ",
