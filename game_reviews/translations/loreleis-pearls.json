The protagonist is a mermaid, a mythical figure whose enchanting song drives men crazy, as Homer famously described in the Odyssey. In our imagination, however, the mermaid is a beautiful woman with a fish tail instead of legs and no bellicose intentions. The setting of Lorelei's Pearls is an underwater cave populated by numerous aquatic animals, made realistic by the Red Rake's work on graphics. High-definition symbols and some excellent animations make the game highly enjoyable.\n\nSlot Features\nThe game grid is the traditional one, with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 fixed lines. One of the advantages of this slot is the betting range, suitable for both inexperienced players and those who seek the thrill of gambling. The minimum bet is 0.25 € (0.01 € per spin), and the maximum bet is 35 €. You win if at least 3 symbols appear in succession from left to right. For those who wish, it is possible to select between 5 and 100 automatic spins without having to set any limits on wins or losses. The volatility is medium, with frequent wins and always good amounts. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.4%, in line with most other slots. For the record, these two data are hypothetical and tested on large numbers, which can sometimes reach hundreds of thousands of games played.\n\nSymbols and Features\nAs often happens, the card symbols pay less, from J to Ace. Thematic symbols have a higher value. Among them, we find the seahorse, the ray, and the lobster. The Wild symbol is the dolphin and rewards you if it appears 3 times while replacing all symbols except the Scatter and the mermaid Lorelei. In addition, the Wild symbol doubles the winnings obtained. The Scatter is represented by the shell with a pearl inside and rewards you if it appears at least 2 times on reels 1, 3, and 5. With 3 symbols, you are entitled to 15 free spins. During the free spins, the low-value symbols are removed.\n\nA special feature is the Lorelei Fusion Minigame, which is activated when the mermaid symbol appears on the reels at least 3 times.

The protagonist is a mermaid, a mythical figure whose enchanting song drives men crazy, as Homer famously described in the Odyssey. In our imagination, however, the mermaid is a beautiful woman with a fish tail instead of legs and no bellicose intentions. The setting of Lorelei's Pearls is an underwater cave populated by numerous aquatic animals, made realistic by the Red Rake's work on graphics. High-definition symbols and some excellent animations make the game highly enjoyable.\n\nSlot Features\nThe game grid is the traditional one, with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 fixed lines. One of the advantages of this slot is the betting range, suitable for both inexperienced players and those who seek the thrill of gambling. The minimum bet is 0.25 € (0.01 € per spin), and the maximum bet is 35 €. You win if at least 3 symbols appear in succession from left to right. For those who wish, it is possible to select between 5 and 100 automatic spins without having to set any limits on wins or losses. The volatility is medium, with frequent wins and always good amounts. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.4%, in line with most other slots. For the record, these two data are hypothetical and tested on large numbers, which can sometimes reach hundreds of thousands of games played.\n\nSymbols and Features\nAs often happens, the card symbols pay less, from J to Ace. Thematic symbols have a higher value. Among them, we find the seahorse, the ray, and the lobster. The Wild symbol is the dolphin and rewards you if it appears 3 times while replacing all symbols except the Scatter and the mermaid Lorelei. In addition, the Wild symbol doubles the winnings obtained. The Scatter is represented by the shell with a pearl inside and rewards you if it appears at least 2 times on reels 1, 3, and 5. With 3 symbols, you are entitled to 15 free spins. During the free spins, the low-value symbols are removed.\n\nA special feature is the Lorelei Fusion Minigame, which is activated when the mermaid symbol appears on the reels at least 3 times. At the beginning of the game, 7 low-value Loreleis will appear on the empty grid. With each spin, the symbols will remain fixed, and the free slots will be occupied by new Lorelei symbols that will fuse. Each fusion will increase the level of our winnings, which can reach up to 10,000 times our bet!\n            ",

High-definition symbols and excellent animations make the game highly enjoyable. Players are treated to a visually stunning game that will keep them entertained for hours.\n\nGameplay Features - Lorelei Fusion Minigame\n\nLorelei's Pearls has a unique feature called the Lorelei Fusion Minigame that is activated when the mermaid symbol appears on the reels at least 3 times. This feature is full of excitement and can increase your winnings up to 10,000 times your bet. At the beginning of the game, seven low-value Loreleis will appear on the empty grid. With each spin, the symbols will remain fixed, and the free slots will be occupied by new Lorelei symbols that will fuse. Each fusion will increase the level of our winnings, making this feature one of the most exciting and rewarding in the game.\n\nGame Symbols and Payouts\n\nLorelei's Pearls features a mix of thematic symbols and card symbols. The card symbols pay less, ranging from J to Ace. Thematic symbols such as the seahorse, the ray, and the lobster have a higher value. The Wild symbol is the dolphin and rewards you if it appears three times while replacing all symbols except the Scatter and the mermaid Lorelei. In addition, the Wild symbol doubles the winnings obtained. The Scatter is represented by the shell with a pearl inside and rewards you if it appears at least two times on reels 1, 3, and 5. \n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nLorelei's Pearls also features a free spins feature. To activate this feature, players need to land three Scatter symbols on reels 1, 3, and 5. Players will be awarded 15 free spins during which the low-value symbols will be removed, increasing your chances of winning big. This feature is not only exciting but also highly rewarding, increasing your chances of hitting a big payout. \n\nGame Volatility and RTP\n\nLorelei's Pearls is a medium volatility slot game with frequent wins and always good amounts. The betting range is suitable for both inexperienced players and those who seek the thrill of gambling. The minimum bet is 0.25 € (0.01 € per spin), and the maximum bet is 35 €. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.4%, in line with most other slots. Players can play with the confidence that they have a fair chance of hitting a win and that their gameplay will be exciting and enjoyable.\n\n        \n            ",

One of the advantages of this slot is the betting range, suitable for both inexperienced players and those who seek the thrill of gambling. The minimum bet is 0.25 € (0.01 € per spin), and the maximum bet is 35 €. You win if at least 3 symbols appear in succession from left to right.

The protagonist is a mermaid, a mythical figure whose enchanting song drives men crazy, as Homer famously described in the Odyssey. In our imagination, however, the mermaid is a beautiful woman with a fish tail instead of legs and no bellicose intentions. The setting of Lorelei's Pearls is an underwater cave populated by numerous aquatic animals, made realistic by the Red Rake's work on graphics. High-definition symbols and some excellent animations make the game highly enjoyable.\n\nSlot Features\nThe game grid is the traditional one, with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 fixed lines. One of the advantages of this slot is the betting range, suitable for both inexperienced players and those who seek the thrill of gambling. The minimum bet is 0.25 € (0.01 € per spin), and the maximum bet is 35 €. You win if at least 3 symbols appear in succession from left to right. For those who wish, it is possible to select between 5 and 100 automatic spins without having to set any limits on wins or losses. The volatility is medium, with frequent wins and always good amounts. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.4%, in line with most other slots. For the record, these two data are hypothetical and tested on large numbers, which can sometimes reach hundreds of thousands of games played.\n\nSymbols and Features\nAs often happens, the card symbols pay less, from J to Ace. Thematic symbols have a higher value. Among them, we find the seahorse, the ray, and the lobster. The Wild symbol is the dolphin and rewards you if it appears 3 times while replacing all symbols except the Scatter and the mermaid Lorelei. In addition, the Wild symbol doubles the winnings obtained. The Scatter is represented by the shell with a pearl inside and rewards you if it appears at least 2 times on reels 1, 3, and 5. With 3 symbols, you are entitled to 15 free spins. During the free spins, the low-value symbols are removed.\n\nA special feature is the Lorelei Fusion Minigame, which is activated when the mermaid symbol appears on the reels at least 3 times. At the beginning of the game, 7 low-value Loreleis will appear on the empty grid. With each spin, the symbols will remain fixed, and the free slots will be occupied by new Lorelei symbols that will fuse. Each fusion will increase the level of our winnings, which can reach up to 10,000 times our bet!\n        ",
