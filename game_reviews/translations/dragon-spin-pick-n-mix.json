They can be found in ancient texts such as those of Homer, in a fable by Phaedrus, and in the Apocalypse told in the Bible. In Chinese culture, the dragon is a symbol of prosperity and fortune, as well as being linked to the imperial family. In this slot, dragons are the custodians of ancient treasures, protected inside a dark cave. To pay tribute to these splendid creatures, Barcrest has worked tirelessly on the graphics, offering a visually superb product, supported by Oriental music that adds pathos to the game.\n\nKey Features\n\nThe fixed game lines are 20, set on a grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The minimum bet is €0.10 per spin and the maximum bet is €100. As the bet increases, so do the 5 Jackpots available. Before starting the game, it is possible to choose 3 out of the 5 offered Bonus, each with special features. The volatility is high and the expected return (RTP) is 96%.\n\nSymbols and Features of Dragon Spin Pick n Mix\n\nThe low-value symbols are the playing cards from 10 to Ace, followed by the red drapes and medallions. Going up we find the ideogram, the garlands and finally the symbol of prosperity. The Wild symbol is our Joker and replaces all symbols except the Bonus ones, of which there are 5. Before starting the game, we will be given the opportunity to choose 3. To play with the bonus, we must then find 3 Dragon Spin symbols. Let's see the Bonuses in detail:\n\n- Symbol Eliminator: thanks to this, unlimited Dragon Spin will be assigned during which the lowest value symbols will be eliminated from the game grid.\n- Fortune Eggs: 5 Dragon Spin will be assigned during which you will have to choose one of the three fortune eggs offered, winning a multiplier ranging from 2 to 50 times the bet.\n- Persisting Wilds: also in this case, we will have 5 Dragon Spin gifts. The Wilds symbols will remain fixed on reels 2, 3, and 4, and each additional Wild symbol displayed will reward with an additional free spin.\n- Goliath Reels: in this case, you will be entitled to 10 Dragon Spin with 3 sets of reels separated by 20 winning lines each. A giant symbol will cover the 3 central reels.\n- Expanding Wilds: 10 Dragon Spin assigned and expanding Wilds, with each additional displayed Wild symbol assigning an additional Dragon Spin.\n\nAn additional Bonus is called the Dragon Pot. During regular gameplay, a pearl may occasionally appear that will end up in the pot placed above the game grid. With two pearls appearing on reels 1 and 5, the bonus is activated, which can give us a multiplier ranging from x25 to x500.\n\nExperienced Gamblers Translation:\n\nVenture into the mystical realm of dragons and uncover the treasures hidden within their dark lair in Dragon Spin Pick n Mix. With 20 fixed game lines spread across a 5x3 grid, the minimum bet of €0.10 per spin and maximum bet of €100 make this slot game approachable for all types of players.\n\nChoose 3 out of the 5 offered bonuses before starting to unlock special features that can significantly increase your winnings. The high volatility and expected return (RTP) of 96% offer experienced gamblers the thrill of high stakes gambling. Wild symbols will replace all others except for the bonus symbols, ramping up the excitement and chances of hitting it big.

They can be found in ancient texts such as those of Homer, in a fable by Phaedrus, and in the Apocalypse told in the Bible. In Chinese culture, the dragon is a symbol of prosperity and fortune, as well as being linked to the imperial family. In this slot, dragons are the custodians of ancient treasures, protected inside a dark cave. To pay tribute to these splendid creatures, Barcrest has worked tirelessly on the graphics, offering a visually superb product, supported by Oriental music that adds pathos to the game.\n\nKey Features\n\nThe fixed game lines are 20, set on a grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The minimum bet is €0.10 per spin and the maximum bet is €100. As the bet increases, so do the 5 Jackpots available. Before starting the game, it is possible to choose 3 out of the 5 offered Bonus, each with special features. The volatility is high and the expected return (RTP) is 96%.\n\nSymbols and Features of Dragon Spin Pick n Mix\n\nThe low-value symbols are the playing cards from 10 to Ace, followed by the red drapes and medallions. Going up we find the ideogram, the garlands and finally the symbol of prosperity. The Wild symbol is our Joker and replaces all symbols except the Bonus ones, of which there are 5. Before starting the game, we will be given the opportunity to choose 3. To play with the bonus, we must then find 3 Dragon Spin symbols. Let's see the Bonuses in detail:\n\n- Symbol Eliminator: thanks to this, unlimited Dragon Spin will be assigned during which the lowest value symbols will be eliminated from the game grid.\n- Fortune Eggs: 5 Dragon Spin will be assigned during which you will have to choose one of the three fortune eggs offered, winning a multiplier ranging from 2 to 50 times the bet.\n- Persisting Wilds: also in this case, we will have 5 Dragon Spin gifts. The Wilds symbols will remain fixed on reels 2, 3, and 4, and each additional Wild symbol displayed will reward with an additional free spin.\n- Goliath Reels: in this case, you will be entitled to 10 Dragon Spin with 3 sets of reels separated by 20 winning lines each. A giant symbol will cover the 3 central reels.\n- Expanding Wilds: 10 Dragon Spin assigned and expanding Wilds, with each additional displayed Wild symbol assigning an additional Dragon Spin.\n\nAn additional Bonus is called the Dragon Pot. During regular gameplay, a pearl may occasionally appear that will end up in the pot placed above the game grid. With two pearls appearing on reels 1 and 5, the bonus is activated, which can give us a multiplier ranging from x25 to x500.\n\nExperienced Gamblers Translation:\n\nVenture into the mystical realm of dragons and uncover the treasures hidden within their dark lair in Dragon Spin Pick n Mix. With 20 fixed game lines spread across a 5x3 grid, the minimum bet of €0.10 per spin and maximum bet of €100 make this slot game approachable for all types of players.\n\nChoose 3 out of the 5 offered bonuses before starting to unlock special features that can significantly increase your winnings. The high volatility and expected return (RTP) of 96% offer experienced gamblers the thrill of high stakes gambling. Wild symbols will replace all others except for the bonus symbols, ramping up the excitement and chances of hitting it big. Whether you prefer unlimited Dragon Spins, multiplier rewards, persisting Wilds, Goliath reels, or expanding Wilds, there's a Bonus feature that will suit your style of play.\n\nTo add to the excitement, occasional pearls will appear, adding to the Dragon Pot located above the game grid. With two pearls appearing on reels 1 and 5, you can trigger the Dragon Pot Bonus feature and potentially earn a multiplier of up to x500.\n\nWith stunning graphics and Oriental-infused music, Barcrest has created a visually impressive game sure to transport you to a world filled with legendary dragons and their treasures. Enjoy the thrill of the hunt, rollick in the stacks of gold, and let the Dragon Spin Pick n Mix guide your path to victory.\n            ",

They can be found in ancient texts such as those of Homer, in a fable by Phaedrus, and in the Apocalypse told in the Bible. In Chinese culture, the dragon is a symbol of prosperity and fortune, as well as being linked to the imperial family. In this slot, dragons are the custodians of ancient treasures, protected inside a dark cave. To pay tribute to these splendid creatures, Barcrest has worked tirelessly on the graphics, offering a visually superb product, supported by Oriental music that adds pathos to the game.\n\nKey Features\n\nThe fixed game lines are 20, set on a grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The minimum bet is €0.10 per spin and the maximum bet is €100. As the bet increases, so do the 5 Jackpots available. Before starting the game, it is possible to choose 3 out of the 5 offered Bonus, each with special features. The volatility is high and the expected return (RTP) is 96%.\n\nSymbols and Features of Dragon Spin Pick n Mix\n\nThe low-value symbols are the playing cards from 10 to Ace, followed by the red drapes and medallions. Going up we find the ideogram, the garlands and finally the symbol of prosperity. The Wild symbol is our Joker and replaces all symbols except the Bonus ones, of which there are 5. Before starting the game, we will be given the opportunity to choose 3. To play with the bonus, we must then find 3 Dragon Spin symbols. Let's see the Bonuses in detail:\n\n- Symbol Eliminator: thanks to this, unlimited Dragon Spin will be assigned during which the lowest value symbols will be eliminated from the game grid.\n- Fortune Eggs: 5 Dragon Spin will be assigned during which you will have to choose one of the three fortune eggs offered, winning a multiplier ranging from 2 to 50 times the bet.\n- Persisting Wilds: also in this case, we will have 5 Dragon Spin gifts. The Wilds symbols will remain fixed on reels 2, 3, and 4, and each additional Wild symbol displayed will reward with an additional free spin.\n- Goliath Reels: in this case, you will be entitled to 10 Dragon Spin with 3 sets of reels separated by 20 winning lines each. A giant symbol will cover the 3 central reels.\n- Expanding Wilds: 10 Dragon Spin assigned and expanding Wilds, with each additional displayed Wild symbol assigning an additional Dragon Spin.\n\nAn additional Bonus is called the Dragon Pot. During regular gameplay, a pearl may occasionally appear that will end up in the pot placed above the game grid. With two pearls appearing on reels 1 and 5, the bonus is activated, which can give us a multiplier ranging from x25 to x500.\n\nExperienced Gamblers Translation:\n\nVenture into the mystical realm of dragons and uncover the treasures hidden within their dark lair in Dragon Spin Pick n Mix. With 20 fixed game lines spread across a 5x3 grid, the minimum bet of €0.10 per spin and maximum bet of €100 make this slot game approachable for all types of players.\n\nChoose 3 out of the 5 offered bonuses before starting to unlock special features that can significantly increase your winnings. The high volatility and expected return (RTP) of 96% offer experienced gamblers the thrill of high stakes gambling. Wild symbols will replace all others except for the bonus symbols, ramping up the excitement and chances of hitting it big. Whether you prefer unlimited Dragon Spins, multiplier rewards, persisting Wilds, Goliath reels, or expanding Wilds, there's a Bonus feature that will suit your style of play.\n\nTo add to the excitement, occasional pearls will appear, adding to the Dragon Pot located above the game grid. With two pearls appearing on reels 1 and 5, you can trigger the Dragon Pot Bonus feature and potentially earn a multiplier of up to x500.\n\nWith stunning graphics and Oriental-infused music, Barcrest has created a visually impressive game sure to transport you to a world filled with legendary dragons and their treasures.

The volatility is high and the expected return (RTP) is 96%.\n\nSymbols and Features of Dragon Spin Pick n Mix\n\nThe low-value symbols are the playing cards from 10 to Ace, followed by the red drapes and medallions. Going up we find the ideogram, the garlands and finally the symbol of prosperity. The Wild symbol is our Joker and replaces all symbols except the Bonus ones, of which there are 5. Before starting the game, we will be given the opportunity to choose 3. To play with the bonus, we must then find 3 Dragon Spin symbols. Let's see the Bonuses in detail:\n\n- Symbol Eliminator: thanks to this, unlimited Dragon Spin will be assigned during which the lowest value symbols will be eliminated from the game grid.\n- Fortune Eggs: 5 Dragon Spin will be assigned during which you will have to choose one of the three fortune eggs offered, winning a multiplier ranging from 2 to 50 times the bet.\n- Persisting Wilds: also in this case, we will have 5 Dragon Spin gifts. The Wilds symbols will remain fixed on reels 2, 3, and 4, and each additional Wild symbol displayed will reward with an additional free spin.\n- Goliath Reels: in this case, you will be entitled to 10 Dragon Spin with 3 sets of reels separated by 20 winning lines each. A giant symbol will cover the 3 central reels.\n- Expanding Wilds: 10 Dragon Spin assigned and expanding Wilds, with each additional displayed Wild symbol assigning an additional Dragon Spin.\n\nAn additional Bonus is called the Dragon Pot. During regular gameplay, a pearl may occasionally appear that will end up in the pot placed above the game grid. With two pearls appearing on reels 1 and 5, the bonus is activated, which can give us a multiplier ranging from x25 to x500.\n\nExperienced Gamblers Translation:\n\nVenture into the mystical realm of dragons and uncover the treasures hidden within their dark lair in Dragon Spin Pick n Mix.
