            "response": "Experience the thrill of the casino floor with the classic slot game, Lucky Streak Mk2 from Big Time Gaming. While many slots draw inspiration from old school fruit machines, few manage to recreate the look and sounds of a vintage machine quite like Lucky Streak Mk2. This game offers decent features, including a classic Cash Stoppa bonus and a Lucky Streak Trail where you can win up to 15 free spins. Discover more about what this retro slot has to offer in our detailed review of Lucky Streak Mk2.\n\nBig Time Gaming typically doesn't offer classic slot machines, or at least they aren't typically associated with these types of titles. However, they already have a few examples in their collection, including Lucky Streak Mk2, a sequel to one of their other slot machines with classic inspiration. But don't let that fool you--there's more to keep an eye out for in this game than you might expect.\n\nThis fruit-themed title offers the usual 5x3 reels with 20 active paylines, and you can win up to 10,000x your bet. With the slot's 96.32% RTP, we're impressed by what you can achieve in this medium-to-high-volatility game. When it comes to features, once again, there's more here than we expected--options include wilds, scatters, free spins, and a Cash Stoppa bonus game.\n\nAn Intriguing Twist on Traditional Graphics\n\nThe visuals of Lucky Streak Mk2 are fantastic. It looks and sounds just like the type of old-school fruit machine you'd find in an arcade, a bar or a chip shop. The machine is a classic slot with flashing lights and loud blips and beeps. \n\nLucky Streak Mk2 provides a real sensory overload. It's bright, noisy, cheeky, and in your face, just like being in a seaside arcade. The design here is simple, yet excellent.\n\nOn the reels, you'll see very simple fruit machine symbols, including cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, and bells. They all pay 0.25, 1, or 5x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline. The pear and watermelon symbols pay 0.5, 2.5, or 12.5x your bet for landing 3, 4, or 5 in a combination. Then there are the bars, double bars, and high bars. Double bars and high bars pay the highest, offering up to 37.5x your bets for landing 5 in a combination.\n\nThe most important symbol is the wild horse shoe. Not only does it substitute for all symbols except the scatter, but landing 2, 3, 4, or 5 will also pay 0.5, 5, 50, or 500x your total bet.\n\nLucky Streak Mk2 is available to play on all devices, including mobile devices. The bold design and relatively simple features make it perfectly playable on smaller screens. The Lucky Streak Mk2 mobile slot runs smoothly.\n\nSlot Features and Symbols\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 slot is played using a classic 5-reel, 3-row, 20-payline machine. To land a winning spin, you'll need to land three or more matching symbols on an adjacent payline starting from the leftmost reel.\n\nThe minimum bet in Lucky Streak Mk2 is 40 cents per spin, with the maximum bet topping out at 40 euros per spin. Use the green arrow buttons to move up or down as needed. Autoplay is available upon request. You can choose to play 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 autospins. Here you will be required to set loss stop limits. You can also set single-win limits if desired.\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 RTP is 96.32%, which puts it slightly above average. With medium to high variance, the maximum win is 10,000x your bet, which can come from a screen full of wilds.\n\nOne thing to note is that any symbol on the base game's reels can be accompanied by a number. This number illuminates the Numbers Path. If this path reaches more than 11, the Cash Stoppa Bonus feature is triggered.\n\nHit the Cash Stoppa button to make your way along the path. The green light moves you along the path, while the red light is the collect. If you're lucky, you'll get a repeat chance, which will give you a second bite of the Cash Stoppa cherry.\n\nPrizes start at 0.5x your total stake. If you make it all the way to the end of the Cash Stoppa path, you'll snag a prize equal to 500x your total bet.\n\nThe game's second bonus feature, the Lucky Streak Free Spins function, is triggered by landing 3, 4, or 5 of the Lucky Streak logo's scatter symbol on the same spin. After a payout of 5, 20, or 100x your total bet, you'll continue to play the feature.\n\nWork your way along the path to win up to 15 free spins. On every Free Spin, you're guaranteed a winning combination. Landing 3 or more Scatters on the same Free Spin results in a retrigger, adding another round of Free Spins to the original total.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nPragmatic Play has released a simple game about stars, planets, and atoms. The strength of Starz Megaways is the star symbol, which is wild and expands to cover the reel when it lands, both in the base game and the bonus feature. In the bonus game, the wild expands and becomes sticky. The maximum payout for this game is 10,000x.",

Se guardiamo le caratteristiche, ancora una volta otteniamo più di quanto ci aspettassimo, le opzioni includono wilds, scatters, giri gratis e un gioco bonus Cash Stoppa.\nUna grafica tradizionale ma accattivante\nIl design della slot Lucky Streak Mk2 è fantastico. Sembra e suona proprio come il tipo di macchina da frutta della vecchia scuola che si trova in una sala giochi, in un bar o in un negozio di patatine fritte. L’allestimento è una classica slot a mobiletto, completa di luci lampeggianti e di bip e bip a tutto volume.\nLucky Streak Mk2 offre un vero e proprio sovraccarico sensoriale. È luminoso, rumoroso, sfacciato e in faccia. Proprio come trovarsi in una sala giochi sul mare. Il design qui è semplice ma eccellente.\nSulle bobine, vedrete simboli di macchine per la frutta molto semplici. Tra questi ci sono ciliegie, limoni, arance, prugne e campanelle. Pagano tutti 0,25, 1 o 5x la vostra scommessa totale se atterrate 3, 4 o 5 su una linea di pagamento. I simboli della pera e dell’anguria pagano 0,5, 2,5 o 12,5x la tua puntata per 3, 4 o 5 in combinazione. Poi ci sono le barre, le barre doppie e le barre alte. Le barre doppie e alte sono le più alte che pagano con 37,5 x puntate per 5 in combinazione.\nIl simbolo più importante è il ferro di cavallo selvaggio. Oltre a sostituire tutti i simboli tranne lo scatter, 2, 3, 4 o 5 pagheranno 0,5, 5, 50 o 500x la vostra puntata totale.\nLucky Streak Mk2 è disponibile per giocare su tutti i dispositivi, compresi quelli mobili. Il design audace e le caratteristiche relativamente semplici lo rendono perfettamente giocabile sui dispositivi con schermo più piccolo. La slot mobile Lucky Streak Mk2 funziona benissimo.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nLa slot Lucky Streak Mk2 si gioca utilizzando una classica macchina a 5 rulli, 3 file, 20 payline. Per ottenere una giocata vincente avrai bisogno di atterrare 3 o più simboli corrispondenti in una payline su oscillazioni adiacenti, cominciando dall’oscillazione più a sinistra.\nLa posta in gioco in Lucky Streak Mk2 parte da 40 centesimi per ogni giro, fino a un massimo di 40 euro per giro. Utilizzare i pulsanti con le frecce verdi per spostarsi verso l’alto o verso il basso a seconda delle esigenze. L’autoplay è disponibile se richiesto. È possibile eseguire 5, 10, 25, 50 o 100 autospin. Qui sarà richiesto di impostare i limiti di loss stop. Se lo si desidera, è possibile impostare anche limiti di vincita singola.\nIl Lucky Streak Mk2 RTP è del 96,32% che lo pone leggermente al di sopra della media. Da media ad alta varianza, la vincita massima è di 10.000 x puntata che verrà da uno schermo pieno di selvaggina.\nNoterete che uno qualsiasi dei simboli sui rulli del gioco base può essere accompagnato da un numero. Questi numeri illuminano il Percorso dei numeri. Se questo percorso supera l’11, si attiva la funzione Cash Stoppa Bonus.\nPremi il pulsante Cash Stoppa per farti strada lungo il percorso. La luce verde ti fa avanzare lungo il percorso mentre la luce rossa è la raccolta. Se siete fortunati, otterrete una possibilità di ripetizione che vi offrirà un secondo morso della ciliegia Cash Stoppa.\nI premi partono da 0,5 x la tua quota totale. Se arrivi fino alla fine del percorso Cash Stoppa, ti intaschi un premio pari a 500x la tua puntata totale.\nIl secondo extra del gioco, la funzione Lucky Streak Free Spins, si attiva atterrando 3, 4 o 5 del simbolo scatter del logo Lucky Streak sullo stesso spin. Dopo un payout di 5, 20 o 100 x la tua puntata totale, continuerai a giocare la funzione.\nLavorate lungo il percorso per vincere fino a 15 giri gratis. Su ogni Giro Gratis, hai la garanzia di ottenere una combinazione vincente. L’atterraggio di 3 o più Scatter sullo stesso Spin gratuito si traduce in un retrigger. Un altro giro di giri liberi viene aggiunto al totale originale.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nPragmatic Play ha rilasciato un semplice gioco sulle stelle, i pianeti e gli atomi. Il punto di forza di Starz Megaways è il simbolo delle stelle, che è selvatico e si espande fino a coprire il mulinello quando atterra, sia nel gioco base che nella funzione bonus. Nel bonus, invece, il wild si espande e diventa appiccicoso. Il payout massimo di questo gioco è di 10.000x.\n\n        ",

Discover what else this retro slot has to offer in our in-depth review of Lucky Streak Mk2.\nBig Time Gaming isn't typically known for offering classic slot machines, but they do have some examples in their collection. Lucky Streak Mk2 is actually a sequel to another one of their slot machines, drawn from the classics, but it has more than a few tricks up its sleeve.\nThis fruit-themed game has the standard 5x3 reels with 20 active paylines, and it's capable of awarding up to 10,000x your bet. Add in the slot's 96.32% RTP, and we're impressed with what you can get in this medium-high volatility game. As for features, we get more than we bargained for, with options like wilds, scatters, free spins, and a Cash Stoppa bonus game.\nTraditional yet captivating graphics\nThe design of the Lucky Streak Mk2 slot is fantastic.

With medium to high volatility, the maximum win is 10,000x your bet, which comes from a screen filled with wild symbols.\nYou'll notice that any symbol on the base game reels may be accompanied by a number. These numbers light up the Number Trail. If this trail goes beyond 11, the Cash Stoppa Bonus feature is activated.\nPress the Cash Stoppa button to make your way along the trail.

While many slots draw inspiration from old school fruit machines, few manage to recreate the look and sounds of a vintage machine quite like Lucky Streak Mk2. This game offers decent features, including a classic Cash Stoppa bonus and a Lucky Streak Trail where you can win up to 15 free spins. Discover more about what this retro slot has to offer in our detailed review of Lucky Streak Mk2.\n\nBig Time Gaming typically doesn't offer classic slot machines, or at least they aren't typically associated with these types of titles. However, they already have a few examples in their collection, including Lucky Streak Mk2, a sequel to one of their other slot machines with classic inspiration. But don't let that fool you--there's more to keep an eye out for in this game than you might expect.\n\nThis fruit-themed title offers the usual 5x3 reels with 20 active paylines, and you can win up to 10,000x your bet. With the slot's 96.32% RTP, we're impressed by what you can achieve in this medium-to-high-volatility game. When it comes to features, once again, there's more here than we expected--options include wilds, scatters, free spins, and a Cash Stoppa bonus game.\n\nThe visuals of Lucky Streak Mk2 are fantastic. It looks and sounds just like the type of old-school fruit machine you'd find in an arcade, a bar or a chip shop. The machine is a classic slot with flashing lights and loud blips and beeps. Lucky Streak Mk2 provides a real sensory overload. It's bright, noisy, cheeky, and in your face, just like being in a seaside arcade. The design here is simple, yet excellent.\n\nOn the reels, you'll see very simple fruit machine symbols, including cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, and bells. They all pay 0.25, 1, or 5x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline. The pear and watermelon symbols pay 0.5, 2.5, or 12.5x your bet for landing 3, 4, or 5 in a combination. Then there are the bars, double bars, and high bars. Double bars and high bars pay the highest, offering up to 37.5x your bets for landing 5 in a combination.\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 slot is played using a classic 5-reel, 3-row, 20-payline machine. To land a winning spin, you'll need to land three or more matching symbols on an adjacent payline starting from the leftmost reel.\n\nThe minimum bet in Lucky Streak Mk2 is 40 cents per spin, with the maximum bet topping out at 40 euros per spin. Autoplay is available upon request. You can choose to play 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 autospins. Here you will be required to set loss stop limits. You can also set single-win limits if desired.\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 RTP is 96.32%, which puts it slightly above average. With medium to high variance, the maximum win is 10,000x your bet, which can come from a screen full of wilds.\n        ",

When it comes to features, once again, there's more here than we expected--options include wilds, scatters, free spins, and a Cash Stoppa bonus game.\n\nAn Intriguing Twist on Traditional Graphics\n\nThe visuals of Lucky Streak Mk2 are fantastic. It looks and sounds just like the type of old-school fruit machine you'd find in an arcade, a bar or a chip shop. The machine is a classic slot with flashing lights and loud blips and beeps. \n\nLucky Streak Mk2 provides a real sensory overload. It's bright, noisy, cheeky, and in your face, just like being in a seaside arcade. The design here is simple, yet excellent.\n\nOn the reels, you'll see very simple fruit machine symbols, including cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, and bells. They all pay 0.25, 1, or 5x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline. The pear and watermelon symbols pay 0.5, 2.5, or 12.5x your bet for landing 3, 4, or 5 in a combination. Then there are the bars, double bars, and high bars. Double bars and high bars pay the highest, offering up to 37.5x your bets for landing 5 in a combination.\n\nThe most important symbol is the wild horse shoe. Not only does it substitute for all symbols except the scatter, but landing 2, 3, 4, or 5 will also pay 0.5, 5, 50, or 500x your total bet.\n\nLucky Streak Mk2 is available to play on all devices, including mobile devices. The bold design and relatively simple features make it perfectly playable on smaller screens. The Lucky Streak Mk2 mobile slot runs smoothly.\n\nSlot Features and Symbols\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 slot is played using a classic 5-reel, 3-row, 20-payline machine. To land a winning spin, you'll need to land three or more matching symbols on an adjacent payline starting from the leftmost reel.\n\nThe minimum bet in Lucky Streak Mk2 is 40 cents per spin, with the maximum bet topping out at 40 euros per spin. Use the green arrow buttons to move up or down as needed. Autoplay is available upon request. You can choose to play 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 autospins. Here you will be required to set loss stop limits. You can also set single-win limits if desired.\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 RTP is 96.32%, which puts it slightly above average. With medium to high variance, the maximum win is 10,000x your bet, which can come from a screen full of wilds.\n\nOne thing to note is that any symbol on the base game's reels can be accompanied by a number. This number illuminates the Numbers Path. If this path reaches more than 11, the Cash Stoppa Bonus feature is triggered.\n\nHit the Cash Stoppa button to make your way along the path. The green light moves you along the path, while the red light is the collect. If you're lucky, you'll get a repeat chance, which will give you a second bite of the Cash Stoppa cherry.\n\nPrizes start at 0.5x your total stake. If you make it all the way to the end of the Cash Stoppa path, you'll snag a prize equal to 500x your total bet.\n\nThe game's second bonus feature, the Lucky Streak Free Spins function, is triggered by landing 3, 4, or 5 of the Lucky Streak logo's scatter symbol on the same spin. After a payout of 5, 20, or 100x your total bet, you'll continue to play the feature.\n\nWork your way along the path to win up to 15 free spins. On every Free Spin, you're guaranteed a winning combination. Landing 3 or more Scatters on the same Free Spin results in a retrigger, adding another round of Free Spins to the original total.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nPragmatic Play has released a simple game about stars, planets, and atoms. The strength of Starz Megaways is the star symbol, which is wild and expands to cover the reel when it lands, both in the base game and the bonus feature. In the bonus game, the wild expands and becomes sticky. The maximum payout for this game is 10,000x.\n            ",

While many slots draw inspiration from old school fruit machines, few manage to recreate the look and sounds of a vintage machine quite like Lucky Streak Mk2. This game offers decent features, including a classic Cash Stoppa bonus and a Lucky Streak Trail where you can win up to 15 free spins. Discover more about what this retro slot has to offer in our detailed review of Lucky Streak Mk2.\n\nBig Time Gaming typically doesn't offer classic slot machines, or at least they aren't typically associated with these types of titles. However, they already have a few examples in their collection, including Lucky Streak Mk2, a sequel to one of their other slot machines with classic inspiration. But don't let that fool you--there's more to keep an eye out for in this game than you might expect.\n\nThis fruit-themed title offers the usual 5x3 reels with 20 active paylines, and you can win up to 10,000x your bet. With the slot's 96.32% RTP, we're impressed by what you can achieve in this medium-to-high-volatility game. When it comes to features, once again, there's more here than we expected--options include wilds, scatters, free spins, and a Cash Stoppa bonus game.\n\nAn Intriguing Twist on Traditional Graphics\n\nThe visuals of Lucky Streak Mk2 are fantastic. It looks and sounds just like the type of old-school fruit machine you'd find in an arcade, a bar or a chip shop. The machine is a classic slot with flashing lights and loud blips and beeps. \n\nLucky Streak Mk2 provides a real sensory overload. It's bright, noisy, cheeky, and in your face, just like being in a seaside arcade. The design here is simple, yet excellent.\n\nOn the reels, you'll see very simple fruit machine symbols, including cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, and bells. They all pay 0.25, 1, or 5x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline. The pear and watermelon symbols pay 0.5, 2.5, or 12.5x your bet for landing 3, 4, or 5 in a combination. Then there are the bars, double bars, and high bars. Double bars and high bars pay the highest, offering up to 37.5x your bets for landing 5 in a combination.\n\nThe most important symbol is the wild horse shoe. Not only does it substitute for all symbols except the scatter, but landing 2, 3, 4, or 5 will also pay 0.5, 5, 50, or 500x your total bet.\n\nLucky Streak Mk2 is available to play on all devices, including mobile devices. The bold design and relatively simple features make it perfectly playable on smaller screens. The Lucky Streak Mk2 mobile slot runs smoothly.\n\nSlot Features and Symbols\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 slot is played using a classic 5-reel, 3-row, 20-payline machine. To land a winning spin, you'll need to land three or more matching symbols on an adjacent payline starting from the leftmost reel.\n\nThe minimum bet in Lucky Streak Mk2 is 40 cents per spin, with the maximum bet topping out at 40 euros per spin. Use the green arrow buttons to move up or down as needed. Autoplay is available upon request. You can choose to play 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 autospins. Here you will be required to set loss stop limits. You can also set single-win limits if desired.\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 RTP is 96.32%, which puts it slightly above average. With medium to high variance, the maximum win is 10,000x your bet, which can come from a screen full of wilds.\n\nOne thing to note is that any symbol on the base game's reels can be accompanied by a number. This number illuminates the Numbers Path. If this path reaches more than 11, the Cash Stoppa Bonus feature is triggered.\n\nHit the Cash Stoppa button to make your way along the path. The green light moves you along the path, while the red light is the collect. If you're lucky, you'll get a repeat chance, which will give you a second bite of the Cash Stoppa cherry.\n\nPrizes start at 0.5x your total stake. If you make it all the way to the end of the Cash Stoppa path, you'll snag a prize equal to 500x your total bet.\n\nThe game's second bonus feature, the Lucky Streak Free Spins function, is triggered by landing 3, 4, or 5 of the Lucky Streak logo's scatter symbol on the same spin. After a payout of 5, 20, or 100x your total bet, you'll continue to play the feature.\n\nWork your way along the path to win up to 15 free spins. On every Free Spin, you're guaranteed a winning combination. Landing 3 or more Scatters on the same Free Spin results in a retrigger, adding another round of Free Spins to the original total.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nPragmatic Play has released a simple game about stars, planets, and atoms. The strength of Starz Megaways is the star symbol, which is wild and expands to cover the reel when it lands, both in the base game and the bonus feature. In the bonus game, the wild expands and becomes sticky. The maximum payout for this game is 10,000x.\n            ",

While many slots draw inspiration from old school fruit machines, few manage to recreate the look and sounds of a vintage machine quite like Lucky Streak Mk2. This game offers decent features, including a classic Cash Stoppa bonus and a Lucky Streak Trail where you can win up to 15 free spins. Discover more about what this retro slot has to offer in our detailed review of Lucky Streak Mk2.\n\nBig Time Gaming typically doesn't offer classic slot machines, or at least they aren't typically associated with these types of titles. However, they already have a few examples in their collection, including Lucky Streak Mk2, a sequel to one of their other slot machines with classic inspiration. But don't let that fool you--there's more to keep an eye out for in this game than you might expect.\n\nThis fruit-themed title offers the usual 5x3 reels with 20 active paylines, and you can win up to 10,000x your bet. With the slot's 96.32% RTP, we're impressed by what you can achieve in this medium-to-high-volatility game. When it comes to features, once again, there's more here than we expected--options include wilds, scatters, free spins, and a Cash Stoppa bonus game.\n\nAn Intriguing Twist on Traditional Graphics\n\nThe visuals of Lucky Streak Mk2 are fantastic. It looks and sounds just like the type of old-school fruit machine you'd find in an arcade, a bar or a chip shop. The machine is a classic slot with flashing lights and loud blips and beeps. \n\nLucky Streak Mk2 provides a real sensory overload. It's bright, noisy, cheeky, and in your face, just like being in a seaside arcade. The design here is simple, yet excellent.\n\nOn the reels, you'll see very simple fruit machine symbols, including cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, and bells. They all pay 0.25, 1, or 5x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline. The pear and watermelon symbols pay 0.5, 2.5, or 12.5x your bet for landing 3, 4, or 5 in a combination. Then there are the bars, double bars, and high bars. Double bars and high bars pay the highest, offering up to 37.5x your bets for landing 5 in a combination.\n\nThe most important symbol is the wild horse shoe. Not only does it substitute for all symbols except the scatter, but landing 2, 3, 4, or 5 will also pay 0.5, 5, 50, or 500x your total bet.\n\nLucky Streak Mk2 is available to play on all devices, including mobile devices. The bold design and relatively simple features make it perfectly playable on smaller screens. The Lucky Streak Mk2 mobile slot runs smoothly.\n\nSlot Features and Symbols\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 slot is played using a classic 5-reel, 3-row, 20-payline machine. To land a winning spin, you'll need to land three or more matching symbols on an adjacent payline starting from the leftmost reel.\n\nThe minimum bet in Lucky Streak Mk2 is 40 cents per spin, with the maximum bet topping out at 40 euros per spin. Use the green arrow buttons to move up or down as needed. Autoplay is available upon request. You can choose to play 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 autospins. Here you will be required to set loss stop limits. You can also set single-win limits if desired.\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 RTP is 96.32%, which puts it slightly above average. With medium to high variance, the maximum win is 10,000x your bet, which can come from a screen full of wilds.\n\nOne thing to note is that any symbol on the base game's reels can be accompanied by a number. This number illuminates the Numbers Path. If this path reaches more than 11, the Cash Stoppa Bonus feature is triggered.\n\nHit the Cash Stoppa button to make your way along the path.

While many slots draw inspiration from old school fruit machines, few manage to recreate the look and sounds of a vintage machine quite like Lucky Streak Mk2. This game offers decent features, including a classic Cash Stoppa bonus and a Lucky Streak Trail where you can win up to 15 free spins. Discover more about what this retro slot has to offer in our detailed review of Lucky Streak Mk2.\n\nBig Time Gaming typically doesn't offer classic slot machines, or at least they aren't typically associated with these types of titles. However, they already have a few examples in their collection, including Lucky Streak Mk2, a sequel to one of their other slot machines with classic inspiration. But don't let that fool you--there's more to keep an eye out for in this game than you might expect.\n\nThis fruit-themed title offers the usual 5x3 reels with 20 active paylines, and you can win up to 10,000x your bet. With the slot's 96.32% RTP, we're impressed by what you can achieve in this medium-to-high-volatility game. When it comes to features, once again, there's more here than we expected--options include wilds, scatters, free spins, and a Cash Stoppa bonus game.\n\nAn Intriguing Twist on Traditional Graphics\n\nThe visuals of Lucky Streak Mk2 are fantastic. It looks and sounds just like the type of old-school fruit machine you'd find in an arcade, a bar or a chip shop. The machine is a classic slot with flashing lights and loud blips and beeps. \n\nLucky Streak Mk2 provides a real sensory overload. It's bright, noisy, cheeky, and in your face, just like being in a seaside arcade. The design here is simple, yet excellent.\n\nOn the reels, you'll see very simple fruit machine symbols, including cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, and bells. They all pay 0.25, 1, or 5x your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline. The pear and watermelon symbols pay 0.5, 2.5, or 12.5x your bet for landing 3, 4, or 5 in a combination. Then there are the bars, double bars, and high bars. Double bars and high bars pay the highest, offering up to 37.5x your bets for landing 5 in a combination.\n\nThe most important symbol is the wild horse shoe. Not only does it substitute for all symbols except the scatter, but landing 2, 3, 4, or 5 will also pay 0.5, 5, 50, or 500x your total bet.\n\nLucky Streak Mk2 is available to play on all devices, including mobile devices. The bold design and relatively simple features make it perfectly playable on smaller screens. The Lucky Streak Mk2 mobile slot runs smoothly.\n\nSlot Features and Symbols\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 slot is played using a classic 5-reel, 3-row, 20-payline machine. To land a winning spin, you'll need to land three or more matching symbols on an adjacent payline starting from the leftmost reel.\n\nThe minimum bet in Lucky Streak Mk2 is 40 cents per spin, with the maximum bet topping out at 40 euros per spin. Use the green arrow buttons to move up or down as needed. Autoplay is available upon request. You can choose to play 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 autospins. Here you will be required to set loss stop limits. You can also set single-win limits if desired.\n\nThe Lucky Streak Mk2 RTP is 96.32%, which puts it slightly above average. With medium to high variance, the maximum win is 10,000x your bet, which can come from a screen full of wilds.\n\nOne thing to note is that any symbol on the base game's reels can be accompanied by a number. This number illuminates the Numbers Path. If this path reaches more than 11, the Cash Stoppa Bonus feature is triggered.\n\nHit the Cash Stoppa button to make your way along the path. The green light moves you along the path, while the red light is the collect. If you're lucky, you'll get a repeat chance, which will give you a second bite of the Cash Stoppa cherry.\n\nPrizes start at 0.5x your total stake. If you make it all the way to the end of the Cash Stoppa path, you'll snag a prize equal to 500x your total bet.\n\nThe game's second bonus feature, the Lucky Streak Free Spins function, is triggered by landing 3, 4, or 5 of the Lucky Streak logo's scatter symbol on the same spin. After a payout of 5, 20, or 100x your total bet, you'll continue to play the feature.\n\nWork your way along the path to win up to 15 free spins. On every Free Spin, you're guaranteed a winning combination. Landing 3 or more Scatters on the same Free Spin results in a retrigger, adding another round of Free Spins to the original total.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nPragmatic Play has released a simple game about stars, planets, and atoms.
