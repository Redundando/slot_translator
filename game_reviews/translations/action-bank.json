            "response": "Action Bank Review: A Classic Slot with Exciting Features\n\nThe Action Bank slot game is reminiscent of old-school fruit machines, with bold and bright reel symbols including lucky 7s, Xs, bars, and noughts. Despite its classic appearance, Action Bank is well-designed with clear symbols and smooth gameplay, accompanied by exciting animations throughout the game.\n\nAdrenaline-Pumping Graphics\nDeveloped by software provider Barcrest, the online slot game Action Bank offers a classic look that is common among many developers. However, don't be fooled. Despite its classic atmosphere, it also features some surprising additional characteristics, coupled with excellent animations. The Action Bank slot offers a set of five reels with a total of 20 fixed paylines.\n\nPlayers will immediately notice the bold and colorful design, which is somewhat of a trademark of Barcrest slot games. The Action Bank slot features five reels and three rows, in addition to 20 paylines. There are only three main symbols for this slot game, which are the lucky red 7, the 'Bar' symbol, and an 'X'.\n\nThe game also features white noughts, which may not win anything, but they could help trigger the Action Bank bonus feature by transforming into scattered symbols in the vault. The wild joker symbol, when landed, substitutes to help create winning combinations and can work in place of all except the scatter.\n\nThe Swing One feature also features three additional double symbols that will multiply any combination they feature in by two.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nWhen playing Action Bank, players must land combinations of three or more symbols to receive a win. Symbols must be landed from left to right to create a winning combination. As mentioned earlier, the wild joker symbol of the slot also helps create wins.\n\nThe lucky number 7 is the symbol you really want to land, although five of these on any active payline will multiply the bet by 500x, the highest amount possible when playing Action Bank.\n\nIf the noughts transform into magical golden vaults (the game's scatter symbol), it means you have activated the Action Bank Free Spins bonus round. After unlocking the vault scatter three or more times, you will be asked to select one, revealing between five and 30 free spins! Plus, you can also choose to play them before the start of the free spins, giving you the chance to win even more. However, since this is a gambling feature, there is also the risk of losing them all, so choose wisely!\n\nInside this bonus round, there are also more double symbols added to the reels, making paylines longer, and players may obtain even bigger rewards!\n\nDuring the free spins, there is a chance to land even more by landing five more scatter symbols.\n\nDuring the free spins, it is possible that the Big Bank Bonus feature is activated randomly, presenting players with 15 bank vault doors to choose from. The main goal in this bonus round is to reveal the multipliers from behind the vaults. The vaults hide four diamonds, five rubies, and six sapphire multipliers. You'll need to reveal three to receive a multiplier and end the round.\n\nBefore spinning and landing winning combinations of classic symbols, it is necessary to select the bet per line. Just like its appearance, Action Bank is simple and this can be done on the left side of the screen.\n\nWith a bet per line that can be played ranging from €0.01 to €20, the Action Bank slot game truly has the potential to attract players of all budgets.\n\nSince the paylines are fixed in this game, your bet per line will always be multiplied by 20. This means that the minimum and maximum total bet per spin is €0.20 and a huge €400.\n\nOnce the bet per line is chosen, you can start spinning by pressing the green button to the right of the reels.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you love stories of big heists in history, then we suggest betting your money on 777 Heist. Red Rake Gaming takes us to the Louvre in an attempt to make a big heist for the painting of the Mona Lisa. The game has a maximum payout of 5,000x that can result from the same spin, plus three reel modifiers and a free bonus for spins.",

Despite its classic appearance, Action Bank is well-designed with clear symbols and smooth gameplay, accompanied by exciting animations throughout the game.\n\nAdrenaline-Pumping Graphics\nDeveloped by software provider Barcrest, the online slot game Action Bank offers a classic look that is common among many developers. However, don't be fooled. Despite its classic atmosphere, it also features some surprising additional characteristics, coupled with excellent animations. The Action Bank slot offers a set of five reels with a total of 20 fixed paylines.\n\nPlayers will immediately notice the bold and colorful design, which is somewhat of a trademark of Barcrest slot games. The Action Bank slot features five reels and three rows, in addition to 20 paylines. There are only three main symbols for this slot game, which are the lucky red 7, the 'Bar' symbol, and an 'X'.\n\nThe game also features white noughts, which may not win anything, but they could help trigger the Action Bank bonus feature by transforming into scattered symbols in the vault. The wild joker symbol, when landed, substitutes to help create winning combinations and can work in place of all except the scatter.\n\nThe Swing One feature also features three additional double symbols that will multiply any combination they feature in by two.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nWhen playing Action Bank, players must land combinations of three or more symbols to receive a win. Symbols must be landed from left to right to create a winning combination. As mentioned earlier, the wild joker symbol of the slot also helps create wins.\n\nThe lucky number 7 is the symbol you really want to land, although five of these on any active payline will multiply the bet by 500x, the highest amount possible when playing Action Bank.\n\nIf the noughts transform into magical golden vaults (the game's scatter symbol), it means you have activated the Action Bank Free Spins bonus round. After unlocking the vault scatter three or more times, you will be asked to select one, revealing between five and 30 free spins! Plus, you can also choose to play them before the start of the free spins, giving you the chance to win even more. However, since this is a gambling feature, there is also the risk of losing them all, so choose wisely!\n\nInside this bonus round, there are also more double symbols added to the reels, making paylines longer, and players may obtain even bigger rewards!\n\nDuring the free spins, there is a chance to land even more by landing five more scatter symbols.\n\nDuring the free spins, it is possible that the Big Bank Bonus feature is activated randomly, presenting players with 15 bank vault doors to choose from. The main goal in this bonus round is to reveal the multipliers from behind the vaults. The vaults hide four diamonds, five rubies, and six sapphire multipliers. You'll need to reveal three to receive a multiplier and end the round.\n\nBefore spinning and landing winning combinations of classic symbols, it is necessary to select the bet per line. Just like its appearance, Action Bank is simple and this can be done on the left side of the screen.\n\nWith a bet per line that can be played ranging from €0.01 to €20, the Action Bank slot game truly has the potential to attract players of all budgets.\n\nSince the paylines are fixed in this game, your bet per line will always be multiplied by 20. This means that the minimum and maximum total bet per spin is €0.20 and a huge €400.\n\nOnce the bet per line is chosen, you can start spinning by pressing the green button to the right of the reels.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you love stories of big heists in history, then we suggest betting your money on 777 Heist. Red Rake Gaming takes us to the Louvre in an attempt to make a big heist for the painting of the Mona Lisa. The game has a maximum payout of 5,000x that can result from the same spin, plus three reel modifiers and a free bonus for spins.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nFeatures\nGraphics\nBonus Rounds\nBig Bank Bonus\nBetting Range\nSimplicity\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Action Bank Review: A Classic Slot with Exciting Features\n\nThe Action Bank slot game is reminiscent of old-school fruit machines, with bold and bright reel symbols including lucky 7s, Xs, bars, and noughts. Despite its classic appearance, Action Bank is well-designed with clear symbols and smooth gameplay, accompanied by exciting animations throughout the game.\n\nAdrenaline-Pumping Graphics\nDeveloped by software provider Barcrest, the online slot game Action Bank offers a classic look that is common among many developers. However, don't be fooled. Despite its classic atmosphere, it also features some surprising additional characteristics, coupled with excellent animations. The Action Bank slot offers a set of five reels with a total of 20 fixed paylines.\n\nPlayers will immediately notice the bold and colorful design, which is somewhat of a trademark of Barcrest slot games. The Action Bank slot features five reels and three rows, in addition to 20 paylines. There are only three main symbols for this slot game, which are the lucky red 7, the 'Bar' symbol, and an 'X'.\n\nThe game also features white noughts, which may not win anything, but they could help trigger the Action Bank bonus feature by transforming into scattered symbols in the vault. The wild joker symbol, when landed, substitutes to help create winning combinations and can work in place of all except the scatter.\n\nThe Swing One feature also features three additional double symbols that will multiply any combination they feature in by two.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nWhen playing Action Bank, players must land combinations of three or more symbols to receive a win. Symbols must be landed from left to right to create a winning combination. As mentioned earlier, the wild joker symbol of the slot also helps create wins.\n\nThe lucky number 7 is the symbol you really want to land, although five of these on any active payline will multiply the bet by 500x, the highest amount possible when playing Action Bank.\n\nIf the noughts transform into magical golden vaults (the game's scatter symbol), it means you have activated the Action Bank Free Spins bonus round. After unlocking the vault scatter three or more times, you will be asked to select one, revealing between five and 30 free spins! Plus, you can also choose to play them before the start of the free spins, giving you the chance to win even more. However, since this is a gambling feature, there is also the risk of losing them all, so choose wisely!\n\nInside this bonus round, there are also more double symbols added to the reels, making paylines longer, and players may obtain even bigger rewards!\n\nDuring the free spins, there is a chance to land even more by landing five more scatter symbols.\n\nDuring the free spins, it is possible that the Big Bank Bonus feature is activated randomly, presenting players with 15 bank vault doors to choose from. The main goal in this bonus round is to reveal the multipliers from behind the vaults. The vaults hide four diamonds, five rubies, and six sapphire multipliers. You'll need to reveal three to receive a multiplier and end the round.\n\nBefore spinning and landing winning combinations of classic symbols, it is necessary to select the bet per line. Just like its appearance, Action Bank is simple and this can be done on the left side of the screen.\n\nWith a bet per line that can be played ranging from €0.01 to €20, the Action Bank slot game truly has the potential to attract players of all budgets.\n\nSince the paylines are fixed in this game, your bet per line will always be multiplied by 20. This means that the minimum and maximum total bet per spin is €0.20 and a huge €400.\n\nOnce the bet per line is chosen, you can start spinning by pressing the green button to the right of the reels.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you love stories of big heists in history, then we suggest betting your money on 777 Heist.

The game has a maximum payout of 5,000x that can result from the same spin, plus three reel modifiers and a free bonus for spins.\n            ",

Action Bank offers several bonus rounds that can significantly increase players' winning potential. </p><p>First up is the Action Bank Free Spins bonus round. To trigger it, just land three or more golden vaults. It's like hitting the jackpot, only instead of coins raining down on you, you get to select one of the vaults, which will reveal between five and 30 free spins. So not exactly a fountain of cash, but it's still pretty good, right?</p><p>Things get even more exciting during the free spins, as more double symbols are added to the reels, making paylines longer and potentially offering even bigger rewards. Talk about getting more bang for your buck!</p><p>But the fun doesn't stop there. There's also a chance to activate the Big Bank Bonus feature during free spins. This feature presents players with 15 bank vault doors to choose from, each hiding a surprise.

Despite its classic appearance, Action Bank is well-designed with clear symbols and smooth gameplay, accompanied by exciting animations throughout the game.\n\nAdrenaline-Pumping Graphics\nDeveloped by software provider Barcrest, the online slot game Action Bank offers a classic look that is common among many developers. However, don't be fooled. Despite its classic atmosphere, it also features some surprising additional characteristics, coupled with excellent animations. The Action Bank slot offers a set of five reels with a total of 20 fixed paylines.\n\nPlayers will immediately notice the bold and colorful design, which is somewhat of a trademark of Barcrest slot games. The Action Bank slot features five reels and three rows, in addition to 20 paylines. There are only three main symbols for this slot game, which are the lucky red 7, the 'Bar' symbol, and an 'X'.\n\nThe game also features white noughts, which may not win anything, but they could help trigger the Action Bank bonus feature by transforming into scattered symbols in the vault. The wild joker symbol, when landed, substitutes to help create winning combinations and can work in place of all except the scatter.\n\nThe Swing One feature also features three additional double symbols that will multiply any combination they feature in by two.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nWhen playing Action Bank, players must land combinations of three or more symbols to receive a win. Symbols must be landed from left to right to create a winning combination. As mentioned earlier, the wild joker symbol of the slot also helps create wins.\n\nThe lucky number 7 is the symbol you really want to land, although five of these on any active payline will multiply the bet by 500x, the highest amount possible when playing Action Bank.\n\nIf the noughts transform into magical golden vaults (the game's scatter symbol), it means you have activated the Action Bank Free Spins bonus round. After unlocking the vault scatter three or more times, you will be asked to select one, revealing between five and 30 free spins! Plus, you can also choose to play them before the start of the free spins, giving you the chance to win even more. However, since this is a gambling feature, there is also the risk of losing them all, so choose wisely!\n\nInside this bonus round, there are also more double symbols added to the reels, making paylines longer, and players may obtain even bigger rewards!\n\nDuring the free spins, there is a chance to land even more by landing five more scatter symbols.\n\nDuring the free spins, it is possible that the Big Bank Bonus feature is activated randomly, presenting players with 15 bank vault doors to choose from. The main goal in this bonus round is to reveal the multipliers from behind the vaults. The vaults hide four diamonds, five rubies, and six sapphire multipliers. You'll need to reveal three to receive a multiplier and end the round.\n\nBefore spinning and landing winning combinations of classic symbols, it is necessary to select the bet per line. Just like its appearance, Action Bank is simple and this can be done on the left side of the screen.\n\nWith a bet per line that can be played ranging from €0.01 to €20, the Action Bank slot game truly has the potential to attract players of all budgets.\n\nSince the paylines are fixed in this game, your bet per line will always be multiplied by 20. This means that the minimum and maximum total bet per spin is €0.20 and a huge €400.\n\nOnce the bet per line is chosen, you can start spinning by pressing the green button to the right of the reels.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you love stories of big heists in history, then we suggest betting your money on 777 Heist. Red Rake Gaming takes us to the Louvre in an attempt to make a big heist for the painting of the Mona Lisa. The game has a maximum payout of 5,000x that can result from the same spin, plus three reel modifiers and a free bonus for spins.\n            ",

Despite its classic appearance, Action Bank is well-designed with clear symbols and smooth gameplay, accompanied by exciting animations throughout the game.\n\nAdrenaline-Pumping Graphics\nDeveloped by software provider Barcrest, the online slot game Action Bank offers a classic look that is common among many developers. However, don't be fooled. Despite its classic atmosphere, it also features some surprising additional characteristics, coupled with excellent animations. The Action Bank slot offers a set of five reels with a total of 20 fixed paylines.\n\nPlayers will immediately notice the bold and colorful design, which is somewhat of a trademark of Barcrest slot games. The Action Bank slot features five reels and three rows, in addition to 20 paylines. There are only three main symbols for this slot game, which are the lucky red 7, the 'Bar' symbol, and an 'X'.\n\nThe game also features white noughts, which may not win anything, but they could help trigger the Action Bank bonus feature by transforming into scattered symbols in the vault. The wild joker symbol, when landed, substitutes to help create winning combinations and can work in place of all except the scatter.\n\nThe Swing One feature also features three additional double symbols that will multiply any combination they feature in by two.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nWhen playing Action Bank, players must land combinations of three or more symbols to receive a win. Symbols must be landed from left to right to create a winning combination. As mentioned earlier, the wild joker symbol of the slot also helps create wins.\n\nThe lucky number 7 is the symbol you really want to land, although five of these on any active payline will multiply the bet by 500x, the highest amount possible when playing Action Bank.\n\nIf the noughts transform into magical golden vaults (the game's scatter symbol), it means you have activated the Action Bank Free Spins bonus round. After unlocking the vault scatter three or more times, you will be asked to select one, revealing between five and 30 free spins! Plus, you can also choose to play them before the start of the free spins, giving you the chance to win even more. However, since this is a gambling feature, there is also the risk of losing them all, so choose wisely!\n\nInside this bonus round, there are also more double symbols added to the reels, making paylines longer, and players may obtain even bigger rewards!\n\nDuring the free spins, there is a chance to land even more by landing five more scatter symbols.\n\nDuring the free spins, it is possible that the Big Bank Bonus feature is activated randomly, presenting players with 15 bank vault doors to choose from. The main goal in this bonus round is to reveal the multipliers from behind the vaults. The vaults hide four diamonds, five rubies, and six sapphire multipliers. You'll need to reveal three to receive a multiplier and end the round.\n\nBefore spinning and landing winning combinations of classic symbols, it is necessary to select the bet per line. Just like its appearance, Action Bank is simple and this can be done on the left side of the screen.\n\nWith a bet per line that can be played ranging from €0.01 to €20, the Action Bank slot game truly has the potential to attract players of all budgets.\n\nSince the paylines are fixed in this game, your bet per line will always be multiplied by 20. This means that the minimum and maximum total bet per spin is €0.20 and a huge €400.\n\nOnce the bet per line is chosen, you can start spinning by pressing the green button to the right of the reels.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you love stories of big heists in history, then we suggest betting your money on 777 Heist.
