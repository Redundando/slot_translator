            "response": "Electric Avenue\nIn terms of potential winnings, this game has high variance and a theoretical return to player of 96.37%. The developers have not yet released details on the maximum payout potential, but based on the winning modes and variance, Electric Avenue can bring in more than 5000x on a winning bet. So, get ready to play the Electric Avenue slot! Unfortunately, it is not based on Eddy Grant's successful song about the famous Brixton street, but it is actually a flashy 80s-themed slot machine from Microgaming. This slot machine boasts a sleek design and is full of neon lights. It is a 6-reel, 4096 ways to win machine that comes with Wild Reels and multipliers. Spin the Free Spins and you will also discover the existence of Sticky Wilds that can increase winnings up to 55x. Let's take a virtual walk in our in-depth review of Electric Avenue.\n\nAn 80s-themed graphic design\nRegarding the graphic design, the Estonian studio opted for an 80s theme and the cultural icons and atmosphere that defined that period. The music is equally representative, with the game offering an electronic funk track for the reel adventure. The Electric Avenue slots have divided the symbols into two categories. The card symbols are low cost, while the bright neon symbols are high cost and include a stereo, a pair of purple and white sneakers, a popcorn can, and a Rubik's Cube. There are enough video moments to make the game lively and dynamic. Wins are marked by an electric current and the background is a deep crimson reminiscent of a sunset in a Miami Vice-style TV series.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe bonus feature is what makes the big wins possible, thanks to the convergence of Sticky Wilds in the first mode and multipliers in the second. With the activation of the bonus with three, four, five, or six Scatter, in addition to the bonus function, a nice prize is obtained. There are two modes of free spins. Electric Free Spins allows you to take seven spins with the power wilds, which are Sticky. A power symbol is randomly selected. This symbol becomes a Power Wild if it stops at any point on reels two through five. Neon Free Spins allows for ten free spins instead of seven, plus the chance to win some amazing multipliers. There is a symbol called Wild Wheel that can stop on the central reels, namely all except one and six. In the event, a random multiplier is given to the resulting win that turn, and the maximum multiplier is 55x.\n\nThe Electric Avenue game engine, with 6 reels and 4 rows, offers 4,096 ways to win. You can play Electric Avenue from 20 cents to 30 euros per spin, but of course, you will have to choose your bets based on your payroll, that is, your initial budget. There are also options to set up autoplay as required.\n\nIf you like high variance slots, you should like Electric Avenue. This is a volatile game. The 96.37% RTP is quite decent considering the volatility. The maximum win is a whopping 6,833x your bet per free spin. With a total hit frequency of 32.16%, almost 1 in every 3 spins results in a winning combination of some kind. The maximum win per spin is 3,200x your bet. This can be obtained with the 8x multiplier in the Free Spins function. Wild Reels can appear randomly on any base game spin. These can land anywhere except reels 1 and 6. Better still, sometimes they can be provided with multipliers that will take your earnings to the stars. In particular, the wild multiplier you can receive on reel 2 is 2x, on reel 3 is 3x, on reel 4 is 4x, and on reel 5 is 5x.\n\nElectric Avenue uses the standard Microgaming game interface. It's easy to set betting levels, play automatically, and consult the paytable. The mobile slot version of Electric Avenue works well. The bright symbols stand out well against the dark background, even on a small screen. Overall, we have to admit that the technicians of this famous provider have not made a mistake even on the mobile platform.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines:\nPlay a neon-themed game infused with an 80s atmosphere called Neon Blaze slot. The game offers a free spins bonus, a \"pick me\" game that brings multipliers, expanding wilds, and five jackpot prizes that are progressive in-game. The game's theoretical return to player is 97.82%.",

The developers have not yet released details on the maximum payout potential, but based on the winning modes and variance, Electric Avenue can bring in more than 5000x on a winning bet. So, get ready to play the Electric Avenue slot! Unfortunately, it is not based on Eddy Grant's successful song about the famous Brixton street, but it is actually a flashy 80s-themed slot machine from Microgaming. This slot machine boasts a sleek design and is full of neon lights. It is a 6-reel, 4096 ways to win machine that comes with Wild Reels and multipliers. Spin the Free Spins and you will also discover the existence of Sticky Wilds that can increase winnings up to 55x. Let's take a virtual walk in our in-depth review of Electric Avenue.\n\nAn 80s-themed graphic design\nRegarding the graphic design, the Estonian studio opted for an 80s theme and the cultural icons and atmosphere that defined that period. The music is equally representative, with the game offering an electronic funk track for the reel adventure. The Electric Avenue slots have divided the symbols into two categories. The card symbols are low cost, while the bright neon symbols are high cost and include a stereo, a pair of purple and white sneakers, a popcorn can, and a Rubik's Cube. There are enough video moments to make the game lively and dynamic. Wins are marked by an electric current and the background is a deep crimson reminiscent of a sunset in a Miami Vice-style TV series.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe bonus feature is what makes the big wins possible, thanks to the convergence of Sticky Wilds in the first mode and multipliers in the second. With the activation of the bonus with three, four, five, or six Scatter, in addition to the bonus function, a nice prize is obtained. There are two modes of free spins. Electric Free Spins allows you to take seven spins with the power wilds, which are Sticky. A power symbol is randomly selected. This symbol becomes a Power Wild if it stops at any point on reels two through five. Neon Free Spins allows for ten free spins instead of seven, plus the chance to win some amazing multipliers. There is a symbol called Wild Wheel that can stop on the central reels, namely all except one and six. In the event, a random multiplier is given to the resulting win that turn, and the maximum multiplier is 55x.\n\nThe Electric Avenue game engine, with 6 reels and 4 rows, offers 4,096 ways to win. You can play Electric Avenue from 20 cents to 30 euros per spin, but of course, you will have to choose your bets based on your payroll, that is, your initial budget. There are also options to set up autoplay as required.\n\nIf you like high variance slots, you should like Electric Avenue. This is a volatile game. The 96.37% RTP is quite decent considering the volatility. The maximum win is a whopping 6,833x your bet per free spin. With a total hit frequency of 32.16%, almost 1 in every 3 spins results in a winning combination of some kind. The maximum win per spin is 3,200x your bet. This can be obtained with the 8x multiplier in the Free Spins function. Wild Reels can appear randomly on any base game spin. These can land anywhere except reels 1 and 6. Better still, sometimes they can be provided with multipliers that will take your earnings to the stars. In particular, the wild multiplier you can receive on reel 2 is 2x, on reel 3 is 3x, on reel 4 is 4x, and on reel 5 is 5x.\n\nElectric Avenue uses the standard Microgaming game interface. It's easy to set betting levels, play automatically, and consult the paytable. The mobile slot version of Electric Avenue works well. The bright symbols stand out well against the dark background, even on a small screen. Overall, we have to admit that the technicians of this famous provider have not made a mistake even on the mobile platform.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines:\nPlay a neon-themed game infused with an 80s atmosphere called Neon Blaze slot. The game offers a free spins bonus, a \"pick me\" game that brings multipliers, expanding wilds, and five jackpot prizes that are progressive in-game. The game's theoretical return to player is 97.82%.\n        ",

The developers have not yet released details on the maximum payout potential, but based on the winning modes and variance, Electric Avenue can bring in more than 5000x on a winning bet. So, get ready to play the Electric Avenue slot! Unfortunately, it is not based on Eddy Grant's successful song about the famous Brixton street, but it is actually a flashy 80s-themed slot machine from Microgaming. This slot machine boasts a sleek design and is full of neon lights. It is a 6-reel, 4096 ways to win machine that comes with Wild Reels and multipliers. Spin the Free Spins and you will also discover the existence of Sticky Wilds that can increase winnings up to 55x. Let's take a virtual walk in our in-depth review of Electric Avenue.\n\nAn 80s-themed graphic design\nRegarding the graphic design, the Estonian studio opted for an 80s theme and the cultural icons and atmosphere that defined that period. The music is equally representative, with the game offering an electronic funk track for the reel adventure. The Electric Avenue slots have divided the symbols into two categories. The card symbols are low cost, while the bright neon symbols are high cost and include a stereo, a pair of purple and white sneakers, a popcorn can, and a Rubik's Cube. There are enough video moments to make the game lively and dynamic. Wins are marked by an electric current and the background is a deep crimson reminiscent of a sunset in a Miami Vice-style TV series.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe bonus feature is what makes the big wins possible, thanks to the convergence of Sticky Wilds in the first mode and multipliers in the second. With the activation of the bonus with three, four, five, or six Scatter, in addition to the bonus function, a nice prize is obtained. There are two modes of free spins. Electric Free Spins allows you to take seven spins with the power wilds, which are Sticky. A power symbol is randomly selected. This symbol becomes a Power Wild if it stops at any point on reels two through five. Neon Free Spins allows for ten free spins instead of seven, plus the chance to win some amazing multipliers. There is a symbol called Wild Wheel that can stop on the central reels, namely all except one and six. In the event, a random multiplier is given to the resulting win that turn, and the maximum multiplier is 55x.\n\nThe Electric Avenue game engine, with 6 reels and 4 rows, offers 4,096 ways to win. You can play Electric Avenue from 20 cents to 30 euros per spin, but of course, you will have to choose your bets based on your payroll, that is, your initial budget. There are also options to set up autoplay as required.\n\nIf you like high variance slots, you should like Electric Avenue. This is a volatile game. The 96.37% RTP is quite decent considering the volatility. The maximum win is a whopping 6,833x your bet per free spin. With a total hit frequency of 32.16%, almost 1 in every 3 spins results in a winning combination of some kind. The maximum win per spin is 3,200x your bet. This can be obtained with the 8x multiplier in the Free Spins function. Wild Reels can appear randomly on any base game spin. These can land anywhere except reels 1 and 6. Better still, sometimes they can be provided with multipliers that will take your earnings to the stars. In particular, the wild multiplier you can receive on reel 2 is 2x, on reel 3 is 3x, on reel 4 is 4x, and on reel 5 is 5x.\n\nElectric Avenue uses the standard Microgaming game interface. It's easy to set betting levels, play automatically, and consult the paytable. The mobile slot version of Electric Avenue works well. The bright symbols stand out well against the dark background, even on a small screen. Overall, we have to admit that the technicians of this famous provider have not made a mistake even on the mobile platform.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines:\nPlay a neon-themed game infused with an 80s atmosphere called Neon Blaze slot. The game offers a free spins bonus, a \"pick me\" game that brings multipliers, expanding wilds, and five jackpot prizes that are progressive in-game. The game's theoretical return to player is 97.82%.\n            ",

The developers have not yet released details on the maximum payout potential, but based on the winning modes and variance, Electric Avenue can bring in more than 5000x on a winning bet. So, get ready to play the Electric Avenue slot! Unfortunately, it is not based on Eddy Grant's successful song about the famous Brixton street, but it is actually a flashy 80s-themed slot machine from Microgaming. This slot machine boasts a sleek design and is full of neon lights. It is a 6-reel, 4096 ways to win machine that comes with Wild Reels and multipliers. Spin the Free Spins and you will also discover the existence of Sticky Wilds that can increase winnings up to 55x. Let's take a virtual walk in our in-depth review of Electric Avenue.\n\nAn 80s-themed graphic design\nRegarding the graphic design, the Estonian studio opted for an 80s theme and the cultural icons and atmosphere that defined that period. The music is equally representative, with the game offering an electronic funk track for the reel adventure. The Electric Avenue slots have divided the symbols into two categories. The card symbols are low cost, while the bright neon symbols are high cost and include a stereo, a pair of purple and white sneakers, a popcorn can, and a Rubik's Cube. There are enough video moments to make the game lively and dynamic. Wins are marked by an electric current and the background is a deep crimson reminiscent of a sunset in a Miami Vice-style TV series.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe bonus feature is what makes the big wins possible, thanks to the convergence of Sticky Wilds in the first mode and multipliers in the second. With the activation of the bonus with three, four, five, or six Scatter, in addition to the bonus function, a nice prize is obtained. There are two modes of free spins. Electric Free Spins allows you to take seven spins with the power wilds, which are Sticky. A power symbol is randomly selected. This symbol becomes a Power Wild if it stops at any point on reels two through five. Neon Free Spins allows for ten free spins instead of seven, plus the chance to win some amazing multipliers. There is a symbol called Wild Wheel that can stop on the central reels, namely all except one and six. In the event, a random multiplier is given to the resulting win that turn, and the maximum multiplier is 55x.\n\nThe Electric Avenue game engine, with 6 reels and 4 rows, offers 4,096 ways to win. You can play Electric Avenue from 20 cents to 30 euros per spin, but of course, you will have to choose your bets based on your payroll, that is, your initial budget. There are also options to set up autoplay as required.\n\nIf you like high variance slots, you should like Electric Avenue. This is a volatile game. The 96.37% RTP is quite decent considering the volatility. The maximum win is a whopping 6,833x your bet per free spin. With a total hit frequency of 32.16%, almost 1 in every 3 spins results in a winning combination of some kind. The maximum win per spin is 3,200x your bet. This can be obtained with the 8x multiplier in the Free Spins function. Wild Reels can appear randomly on any base game spin. These can land anywhere except reels 1 and 6. Better still, sometimes they can be provided with multipliers that will take your earnings to the stars. In particular, the wild multiplier you can receive on reel 2 is 2x, on reel 3 is 3x, on reel 4 is 4x, and on reel 5 is 5x.\n\nElectric Avenue uses the standard Microgaming game interface. It's easy to set betting levels, play automatically, and consult the paytable. The mobile slot version of Electric Avenue works well. The bright symbols stand out well against the dark background, even on a small screen. Overall, we have to admit that the technicians of this famous provider have not made a mistake even on the mobile platform.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines:\nPlay a neon-themed game infused with an 80s atmosphere called Neon Blaze slot. The game offers a free spins bonus, a \"pick me\" game that brings multipliers, expanding wilds, and five jackpot prizes that are progressive in-game. The game's theoretical return to player is 97.82%.\n            ",

The developers have not yet released details on the maximum payout potential, but based on the winning modes and variance, Electric Avenue can bring in more than 5000x on a winning bet. So, get ready to play the Electric Avenue slot! Unfortunately, it is not based on Eddy Grant's successful song about the famous Brixton street, but it is actually a flashy 80s-themed slot machine from Microgaming. This slot machine boasts a sleek design and is full of neon lights. It is a 6-reel, 4096 ways to win machine that comes with Wild Reels and multipliers. Spin the Free Spins and you will also discover the existence of Sticky Wilds that can increase winnings up to 55x. Let's take a virtual walk in our in-depth review of Electric Avenue.\n\nAn 80s-themed graphic design\nRegarding the graphic design, the Estonian studio opted for an 80s theme and the cultural icons and atmosphere that defined that period. The music is equally representative, with the game offering an electronic funk track for the reel adventure. The Electric Avenue slots have divided the symbols into two categories. The card symbols are low cost, while the bright neon symbols are high cost and include a stereo, a pair of purple and white sneakers, a popcorn can, and a Rubik's Cube. There are enough video moments to make the game lively and dynamic. Wins are marked by an electric current and the background is a deep crimson reminiscent of a sunset in a Miami Vice-style TV series.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe bonus feature is what makes the big wins possible, thanks to the convergence of Sticky Wilds in the first mode and multipliers in the second. With the activation of the bonus with three, four, five, or six Scatter, in addition to the bonus function, a nice prize is obtained. There are two modes of free spins. Electric Free Spins allows you to take seven spins with the power wilds, which are Sticky. A power symbol is randomly selected. This symbol becomes a Power Wild if it stops at any point on reels two through five. Neon Free Spins allows for ten free spins instead of seven, plus the chance to win some amazing multipliers. There is a symbol called Wild Wheel that can stop on the central reels, namely all except one and six. In the event, a random multiplier is given to the resulting win that turn, and the maximum multiplier is 55x.\n\nThe Electric Avenue game engine, with 6 reels and 4 rows, offers 4,096 ways to win. You can play Electric Avenue from 20 cents to 30 euros per spin, but of course, you will have to choose your bets based on your payroll, that is, your initial budget. There are also options to set up autoplay as required.\n\nIf you like high variance slots, you should like Electric Avenue. This is a volatile game. The 96.37% RTP is quite decent considering the volatility. The maximum win is a whopping 6,833x your bet per free spin. With a total hit frequency of 32.16%, almost 1 in every 3 spins results in a winning combination of some kind. The maximum win per spin is 3,200x your bet. This can be obtained with the 8x multiplier in the Free Spins function. Wild Reels can appear randomly on any base game spin. These can land anywhere except reels 1 and 6. Better still, sometimes they can be provided with multipliers that will take your earnings to the stars. In particular, the wild multiplier you can receive on reel 2 is 2x, on reel 3 is 3x, on reel 4 is 4x, and on reel 5 is 5x.\n\nElectric Avenue uses the standard Microgaming game interface. It's easy to set betting levels, play automatically, and consult the paytable. The mobile slot version of Electric Avenue works well. The bright symbols stand out well against the dark background, even on a small screen. Overall, we have to admit that the technicians of this famous provider have not made a mistake even on the mobile platform.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines:\nPlay a neon-themed game infused with an 80s atmosphere called Neon Blaze slot. The game offers a free spins bonus, a \"pick me\" game that brings multipliers, expanding wilds, and five jackpot prizes that are progressive in-game. The game's theoretical return to player is 97.82%.\n            ",
