Se vuoi tentare il grande colpo ti consigliamo di sederti davanti alla slot Reel Banks e lasciarti sorprendere dalle qualità sviluppate da Pragmatic Play. Scopriremo di seguito quali sono le qualità del gioco, ma soprattutto in che modo questa tematica sia diventata un’ottima attrazione per chi ama scommettere nei casino online.\nVediamo ciò che ha da offrire Reel Banks con la sua struttura semplice 5×3, le sue 25 linee di pagamento attive e il suo RTP al 96,04%.\nGrafica della slot Reel Banks\nLa slot Reel Banks ha un enorme punto in suo favore: ha una grafica molto bella, coinvolgente e con immagini che sono più realistiche che mai. La griglia di gioco viene applicata su uno sfondo che raffigura una banca e rende subito chiaro il messaggio al giocatore. La colonna sonora è interessante e rende ancora più completo il tuo tentativo di forzare questo caveau per mettere mano su importanti vincite.\nI simboli scelti per la storia sono un richiamo alla semplicità delle slot retrò: abbiamo una borsa ricca di denaro, delle mazzette, diamanti, cuori, picche e fiori e soprattutto il numero 7, che è il vero simbolo della fortuna. Attenzione però: il banchiere è il più remunerativo e vale fino a 16 volte la puntata.\nCaratteristiche di gioco e funzioni\nNon mancano neppure alcune funzionalità che riescono a rendere il gioco più eccitante. Pensiamo per esempio ai cosiddetti Money scatter che fanno parte della funzione Money Collect e si posizionano sulla griglia con un valore variabile che va da x1 e x500. Non dimentichiamo poi i giri gratuiti che si attivano se gli Scatter si posizionano almeno in 5 caselle nello stesso momento. In quel caso il giocatore ottiene subito 9 giri gratuiti e potrà così accogliere i valori dei simboli Money.\nSe desideri provare le funzioni bonus del gioco, magari in versione demo per prendere confidenza con il gioco, potrai acquistare il bonus e attivarlo in qualsiasi momento durante il tuo gameplay.\nConsiderazioni finali\nUna slot frizzante, non tanto per le grandi azioni di gioco, ma per il tipo di esperienza che lascia trasparire giro dopo giro. La Reel Banks slot è sicuramente piacevole e divertente, ed è molto intuitiva e semplice anche come stile di gioco. Non sarà un tema così innovativo e originale, ma è uno dei temi più amati dai giocatori!\nIl momento più piacevole resta sicuramente quello dei free spin, che permettono di arricchirsi in modo molto più “facile”, se così possiamo dire!\n\nDomande Frequenti \nQual è il suo RTP?\n\nHa un buon RTP del 96,04% in linea con la media del mercato.\n\n\n\nPosso giocare alla slot Reel Banks gratis?\n\nCerto, molti casinò online con licenza ADM offrono la versione demo della slot, ma anche sul nostro sito potrai provarla tutte le volte che vuoi.\n\n\n\nQual è il punto di forza di questa slot online?\n\nDobbiamo rendere omaggio ai suoi free spin, che sono un modo piacevole per sfidare la fortuna e provare a vincere qualcosa in più.\n\n\n\n",
