Great Rhino is no exception, offering an intuitive and easy-to-play experience that is both eye-catching and entertaining. This simplicity makes it accessible to first-time players, while its maximum bet of €100 makes it satisfying for experienced, risk-loving gamblers as well.\n\nThe game takes place in the African savannah, with warm and immersive graphics that realistically reproduce the animals that inhabit this landscape. The rhinoceros is the star of the slot, but other typical African animals also make an appearance. As for winning possibilities, Great Rhino has medium volatility, meaning wins are neither too frequent nor too rare, and prize amounts can reach significant sums. The Return to Player rate is a standard 96.53%, consistent with the Pragmatic Play's aim for an RTP of around 96% for all its slots.\n\nAs usual for this developer, the symbols in Great Rhino are both thematic and non-thematic. Non-thematic symbols include the usual numerical and alphabetical cards from J to Ace. Thematic symbols depict the animals of the African savannah, such as the lynx, flamingos, hyenas, and crocodiles. These symbols' values can be accessed in the paytable by pressing the \"i\" button before the game begins.\n\nThe Wild symbol is the rhinoceros itself, which acts as a standard substitute symbol in addition to triggering two jackpots during free spins if the rhinoceros completely fills the game screen. The Scatter symbol, a tree, triggers 10 free spins when landing on the reels at least three times. During free spins, the rhinoceros becomes a stacked wild that remains fixed in place. If there are 14 rhinoceros symbols at the end of the game, a prize of 375 times the bet is awarded. If there are 15 Wild symbols, the maximum jackpot of 500 times the bet is won.\n\nOverall, Great Rhino is a simple yet engaging game that offers a chance to win significant rewards for both novice and experienced players who enjoy a bit of risk.",

If you manage to land 14 rhino symbols at the end of the game, a prize of 375 times the bet is awarded. But, if you manage to land a screen full of 15 wild symbols, you'll win the maximum jackpot of 500 times the bet!</p><p>Overall, Great Rhino offers a unique and thrilling online gaming experience that is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end.

Don\\'t worry, the paytable tells you everything you need to know.</p><p>The rhinoceros symbol is the game\\'s Wild symbol, replacing all symbols but the Scatter. Get lucky and land the rhinoceros during free spins and fill the entire screen, and you could trigger some seriously hefty jackpots. The Scatter symbol is represented by a tree, which triggers 10 free spins when it lands on the reels three or more times. During free spins, the rhinoceros becomes a stacked wild and stays in place while you take advantage of those limited rounds.</p><p>So put on your safari hat and pack your binoculars, because it\\'s time to go exploring the African savannah. Encounter lions, elephants, flamingos, hyenas and more as you make your way to those jackpot wins. With Great Rhino, there\\'s never a boring moment.</p>'}"

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and features\n\nGreat Rhino offers players an intuitive and easy-to-play experience that is both eye-catching and entertaining. The game takes place in the African savannah, and the symbols depict the animals of this landscape. The Wild symbol is the rhinoceros itself which acts as a standard substitute symbol, in addition to triggering two jackpots during free spins if the rhinoceros completely fills the game screen. The Scatter symbol, a tree, triggers 10 free spins when landed at least three times. During free spins, the rhinoceros becomes a stacked wild that remains fixed in place. If there are 14 rhinoceros symbols at the end of the game, a prize of 375 times the bet is awarded. If there are 15 Wild symbols, the maximum jackpot of 500 times the bet is won.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nGreat Rhino is set in the African savannah, with immersive graphics that realistically reproduce the animals of this landscape. The rhinoceros is the star of the slot game, and other typical African animals, such as the lynx, flamingos, hyenas, and crocodiles, also make appearances. The game provides a warm and engaging environment for players to explore.\n\nJackpot and bonuses\n\nGreat Rhino has medium volatility, meaning wins are neither too frequent nor too rare, and prize amounts can reach significant sums. The Return to Player rate is a standard 96.53%, consistent with Pragmatic Play's aim for an RTP of around 96% for all its slots. During free spins, the rhinoceros becomes a stacked wild, and if there are 14 rhinoceros symbols at the end of the game, a prize of 375 times the bet is awarded, with the maximum jackpot of 500 times the bet won with 15 Wild symbols.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nGreat Rhino has medium volatility, meaning that players can expect a relatively balanced mix of wins and losses. The game's Return to Player rate is a standard 96.53%, which is consistent with Pragmatic Play's aim for an RTP of around 96% for all its slots.\n\nTarget audience\n\nGreat Rhino is accessible to first-time players, offering a simple and enjoyable gaming experience. At the same time, its maximum bet of €100 makes it satisfying for experienced, risk-loving gamblers as well. Therefore, Great Rhino's target audience is slot players who enjoy a bit of risk and a chance to win significant rewards.\n\n        \n            ",

The game has medium volatility, making wins neither too frequent nor too rare and allowing prize amounts to reach significant sums. Non-thematic and thematic symbols depict African savannah animals and their values can be accessed in the paytable. The Wild symbol is the rhinoceros, which acts as a standard substitute symbol and triggers jackpots during free spins by filling the game screen. The Scatter symbol is a tree that triggers 10 free spins when landing on the reels at least three times. During free spins, the rhinoceros becomes a stacked wild that remains fixed in place.\n\nGraphics and Theme\n\nGreat Rhino takes place in the African savannah and has warm and immersive graphics that realistically depict the animals that inhabit this landscape. The rhinoceros is the star of the game, but other typical African animals also make an appearance. Thematic symbols depict animals such as the lynx, flamingos, hyenas, and crocodiles. The graphics and theme work together to create an eye-catching and entertaining gaming experience.\n\nJackpot Opportunities\n\nGreat Rhino features two jackpots triggered by the Wild symbol during free spins if the rhinoceros completely fills the game screen. If there are 14 Wild symbols at the end of the game, a prize of 375 times the bet is awarded. If there are 15 Wild symbols, the maximum jackpot of 500 times the bet is won. These jackpots offer significant opportunities for players to win big rewards.\n\nRTP Rate and Maximum Bet\n\nThe Return to Player rate for Great Rhino is a standard 96.53%, consistent with Pragmatic Play's aim for an RTP of around 96% for all its slots. The maximum bet for the game is €100, offering a satisfying option for experienced, risk-loving gamblers.\n\nSuitability for Players\n\nGreat Rhino by Pragmatic Play is a simple yet engaging game that offers a chance to win significant rewards for both novice and experienced players who enjoy a bit of risk. The game's medium volatility offers a good balance between winning frequency and prize amount. The intuitive and easy-to-play gameplay make it accessible to first-time players, while its €100 maximum bet makes it satisfying for experienced, risk-loving gamblers as well.\n\n        \n            ",

Great Rhino is no exception, offering an intuitive and easy-to-play experience that is both eye-catching and entertaining. This simplicity makes it accessible to first-time players, while its maximum bet of €100 makes it satisfying for experienced, risk-loving gamblers as well.\n\nThe game takes place in the African savannah, with warm and immersive graphics that realistically reproduce the animals that inhabit this landscape. The rhinoceros is the star of the slot, but other typical African animals also make an appearance. As for winning possibilities, Great Rhino has medium volatility, meaning wins are neither too frequent nor too rare, and prize amounts can reach significant sums. The Return to Player rate is a standard 96.53%, consistent with the Pragmatic Play's aim for an RTP of around 96% for all its slots.\n\nAs usual for this developer, the symbols in Great Rhino are both thematic and non-thematic. Non-thematic symbols include the usual numerical and alphabetical cards from J to Ace. Thematic symbols depict the animals of the African savannah, such as the lynx, flamingos, hyenas, and crocodiles. These symbols' values can be accessed in the paytable by pressing the \"i\" button before the game begins.\n\nThe Wild symbol is the rhinoceros itself, which acts as a standard substitute symbol in addition to triggering two jackpots during free spins if the rhinoceros completely fills the game screen. The Scatter symbol, a tree, triggers 10 free spins when landing on the reels at least three times. During free spins, the rhinoceros becomes a stacked wild that remains fixed in place. If there are 14 rhinoceros symbols at the end of the game, a prize of 375 times the bet is awarded. If there are 15 Wild symbols, the maximum jackpot of 500 times the bet is won.\n\nOverall, Great Rhino is a simple yet engaging game that offers a chance to win significant rewards for both novice and experienced players who enjoy a bit of risk.\n        ",
