Spoglia la tua idea di slot di tutto e riducila al minimo indispensabile. Ecco, ora ti trovi di fronte a Fruity Gold! La nostra presentazione non vuole sminuire il lavoro fatto da Synot Games, ma è giusto mostrare il titolo per ciò che è. Siamo davanti a una video slot con una struttura di 3 rulli e 3 file, per un totale di 27 linee di pagamento. Il tema è tradizionale e ripropone la frutta, un aspetto che molti hanno avuto modo di conoscere e apprezzare da anni anche nei casinò terrestri.\nSono previsti dei simboli misteriosi, Wild e Double Wild e la possibilità di sfruttare un moltiplicatore che spazia all’interno di un range che va da 2x e 300x. In tutto questo, i giocatori esperti hanno la possibilità di rivivere i primi ricordi, le fasi uniche che hanno provato la prima volta che si sono trovati di fronte a una slot machine terrestre. Ma questa volta potranno farlo da casa, in totale relax e sicurezza.\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nParlare di grafica è un po’ eccessivo, non perché non ci sia un dettaglio grafico, ma perché è molto minimal. Lo scenario ricreato è privo di fronzoli e ridotto ai minimi termini. Abbiamo uno sfondo molto tradizionale, dove i giocatori pro si saranno sicuramente già trovati sedendo all’interno di un casinò. I suoni sono altrettanto semplici e seguono il regolare funzionamento di una slot. Il gioco si completa con la presenza dei frutti che abbiamo visto e rivisto in diverse occasioni. Ma sono i simboli speciali a fare la differenza e dare un colpo di vita al gameplay. Il Double Wilds per esempio ha il potere di prendere il posto di tutti i frutti, oltre a migliorare anche la linea di pagamento con un moltiplicatore a 2x. Discorso analogo per la figura del Joker che però non ha il potere di raddoppiare lo posta in palio.\nI simboli della frutta hanno un valore del tutto nominale. Per esempio i Meloni e l’Uva sono capaci di offrire 6 volte la tua scommessa. Le Prugne e Arance si fermano a 4 volte, mentre i Limoni e lw Ciliegie sono i più bassi con un massimo di 2x. Restano fuori il Lucky 7 e la Campana che offrono rispettivamente 30x e 10x.\nFunzioni speciali\nCome si può chiaramente intendere da quanto abbiamo raccontato fino ad ora questa slot è priva di colpi di scena o di round speciali che potranno cambiare radicalmente la tua vita in termini di vincita. Trattandosi di una versione retrò si presenta senza giri extra, senza spin gratis, animazioni e funzioni di alcun tipo. Ciò non significa che non vincerai premi importanti, ma dovrai avere pazienza e mettere in atto una strategia di scommessa che sia adatta a questo tipo di giochi.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Fruity Gold\nFruity Gold richiama quindi le vecchie atmosfere tipiche di un casinò reale, dove molti appassionati giocavano in carne e ossa. Resta una video slot brillante, con caratteristiche carine, ma per sognare in grande dovrai contare solo su i moltiplicatori e i simboli Wild, pronti a rendere vibrante questo cocktail a base di frutta.\n",

We don't intend to diminish the work done by Synot Games, but it's time to show the title for what it is. We're looking at a video slot with a classic fruit theme, featuring 3 reels and 3 rows and a total of 27 paylines. There are also mystery symbols, Wilds, and Double Wilds, as well as a multiplier ranging from 2x to 300x. Experienced gamblers will relive the unique first memories of playing at a land-based casino, but this time from home, in total relaxation and safety.\n\nGraphics and symbols\n\nTalking about graphics might be excessive, not because there is a lack of detail, but because it's kept minimal. The backdrop is traditional, and seasoned players will recognize it from their time spent in casinos. The sounds are just as simple and follow the regular functioning of a slot machine. The gameplay is completed with the presence of fruit symbols seen in different occasions. But it's the special symbols that make the difference and bring the gameplay to life. Double Wilds, for example, can replace all fruit symbols and improve the payline with a 2x multiplier. Similarly, the Joker symbol doesn't double the stakes.\n\nThe fruit symbols themselves have a nominal value. For instance, melons and grapes can offer up to 6x your bet, while plums and oranges stop at 4x, and lemons and cherries are the lowest paying symbols, with a maximum of 2x. Lucky 7 and the Bell are the most valuable symbols, offering 30x and 10x, respectively.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nAs you might have guessed by now, this slot is devoid of surprises or special rounds that could drastically change your winnings. It's a retro version that doesn't present any extra spins or animations. But that doesn't mean you won't land significant prizes. You'll need patience and a betting strategy suitable for this kind of game.\n\nFinal Considerations on Fruity Gold\n\nFruity Gold invokes the old-school atmosphere typical of a real casino, where many enthusiasts played for real money. It's a brilliant video slot with a cute set of features, but to dream big, you'll have to count on the multipliers and Wild symbols that make this fruit cocktail vibrate.",

The game has a straightforward gameplay, with no surprises or special rounds that may drastically change your life in terms of winnings. It comes without extra spins, free spins, animations, or any functions of any kind.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols in Fruity Gold are very typical of a classic fruit slot game. The fruit symbols have a wholly nominal value, with Melons and Grapes offering six times your bet. Plums and Oranges stop at four times, while Lemons and Cherries are the lowest, with a maximum of 2x. The Lucky 7 and Bell are excluded, offering 30x and 10x, respectively. Mysterious symbols, Wilds, and Double Wilds are available, with the possibility of utilizing a multiplier ranging from 2x to 300x. The Double Wilds has the power to take the place of all fruits, as well as improve the payline with a 2x multiplier. The Joker figure has a similar effect, but it does not have the power to double the stake at stake.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics in Fruity Gold may be a bit excessive, not because they lack detail, but because they're very minimal. The recreated background is devoid of frills and reduced to the basics. The sounds are equally simple and follow the regular functioning of a slot game. The game is completed by the presence of fruits that we've seen over and over again in various occasions.\n\nFeatures\n\nFruity Gold is a retro version of a slot game and comes without extra spins, free spins, animations, or any functions of any kind. However, the game is not entirely devoid of features. Experienced players will appreciate the presence of Double Wilds, Wilds, and multipliers ranging from 2x to 300x. While there may be no surprises or special rounds that can drastically change your life in terms of winnings, these features provide players with ample opportunities to win significant prizes.\n\nTheme\n\nFruity Gold's theme is traditional and features fruits, which is an aspect that many have come to love and appreciate about slot games for years, even in land-based casinos. The game brings back the old typical atmosphere of a real casino, where many passionate players played in the flesh. It remains a brilliant video slot, with nice features, but to dream big, you'll only have to rely on multipliers and Wild symbols, ready to make this fruit cocktail vibrantly.\n\n        \n            ",

Strip down your idea of a slot game to its bare essentials. That's Fruity Gold for you! Our presentation does not intend to belittle Synot Games' effort, but it's only fair to showcase the game for what it is. We're facing a video slot game with a 3x3 reel structure, totaling 27 paylines. The theme is traditional and features fruits, an aspect that many have come to love and appreciate for years, even in land-based casinos. \n\nMysterious symbols, Wilds, and Double Wilds are available, with the possibility of utilizing a multiplier ranging from 2x to 300x. In all of this, experienced players have a chance to relive their early memories, unique phases they felt the first time they sat in front of a land-based slot machine. But this time, they can do it from home, with total relaxation and security.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nTalking about graphics may be a bit excessive, not because they lack detail, but because they're very minimal. The recreated background is devoid of frills and reduced to the basics. We have a very traditional backdrop, where pro players have surely found themselves seated inside a casino. The sounds are equally simple and follow the regular functioning of a slot game. The game is completed by the presence of fruits that we've seen over and over again in various occasions. But it's the special symbols that make a difference and give a boost to the gameplay. The Double Wilds, for example, has the power to take the place of all fruits, as well as improve the payline with a 2x multiplier. The Joker figure has a similar effect but does not have the power to double the stake at stake. \n\nThe fruit symbols have a wholly nominal value. For example, Melons and Grapes can offer six times your bet. Plums and Oranges stop at four times, while Lemons and Cherries are the lowest, with a maximum of 2x. The Lucky 7 and Bell are excluded, offering 30x and 10x, respectively.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nAs you may have already guessed from what we've recounted so far, this slot is devoid of surprises or special rounds that may drastically change your life in terms of winnings. Being a retro version, it comes without extra spins, free spins, animations, or any functions of any kind. This doesn't mean you won't win significant prizes, but you'll need to be patient and implement a betting strategy suitable for this type of game.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Fruity Gold Slot\n\nFruity Gold thus brings back the old typical atmosphere of a real casino, where many passionate players played in the flesh. It remains a brilliant video slot, with nice features, but to dream big, you'll only have to rely on multipliers and Wild symbols, ready to make this fruit cocktail vibrantly.\n            ",

Strip down your idea of a slot game to its bare essentials. That's Fruity Gold for you! Our presentation does not intend to belittle Synot Games' effort, but it's only fair to showcase the game for what it is. We're facing a video slot game with a 3x3 reel structure, totaling 27 paylines. The theme is traditional and features fruits, an aspect that many have come to love and appreciate for years, even in land-based casinos. \n\nMysterious symbols, Wilds, and Double Wilds are available, with the possibility of utilizing a multiplier ranging from 2x to 300x. In all of this, experienced players have a chance to relive their early memories, unique phases they felt the first time they sat in front of a land-based slot machine. But this time, they can do it from home, with total relaxation and security.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nTalking about graphics may be a bit excessive, not because they lack detail, but because they're very minimal. The recreated background is devoid of frills and reduced to the basics. We have a very traditional backdrop, where pro players have surely found themselves seated inside a casino. The sounds are equally simple and follow the regular functioning of a slot game. The game is completed by the presence of fruits that we've seen over and over again in various occasions. But it's the special symbols that make a difference and give a boost to the gameplay. The Double Wilds, for example, has the power to take the place of all fruits, as well as improve the payline with a 2x multiplier. The Joker figure has a similar effect but does not have the power to double the stake at stake. \n\nThe fruit symbols have a wholly nominal value. For example, Melons and Grapes can offer six times your bet. Plums and Oranges stop at four times, while Lemons and Cherries are the lowest, with a maximum of 2x. The Lucky 7 and Bell are excluded, offering 30x and 10x, respectively.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nAs you may have already guessed from what we've recounted so far, this slot is devoid of surprises or special rounds that may drastically change your life in terms of winnings. Being a retro version, it comes without extra spins, free spins, animations, or any functions of any kind. This doesn't mean you won't win significant prizes, but you'll need to be patient and implement a betting strategy suitable for this type of game.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Fruity Gold Slot\n\nFruity Gold thus brings back the old typical atmosphere of a real casino, where many passionate players played in the flesh. It remains a brilliant video slot, with nice features, but to dream big, you'll only have to rely on multipliers and Wild symbols, ready to make this fruit cocktail vibrantly.\n            ",
