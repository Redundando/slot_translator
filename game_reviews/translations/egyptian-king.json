Set inside a pyramid, amidst sacred tombs and ancient symbols linked to the pharaoh's history, the free slot Egyptian King produced by iSoftBet is part of our collection of free online slots with an Egyptian theme. Let's see how it works.\n\nGame structure of the Egyptian King slot without registration:\nThe slot has 5 reels and 20 paylines. Its gameplay ranges from €0.20 up to a limit of €20.00 per spin on all devices. There are 4 bonus features. The Free Spins feature includes Golden Sticky Wilds with multipliers up to 3 times, which will allow you to accumulate big wins. What symbols should you keep an eye on?\n\nAncient and sacred symbology\n\nSymbols include: the standard cards A, K, Q, and J, the Scarabs: Eyes of Ra, Wadjet the cobra goddess, Bastet the cat god, Anubis the dog god, and the Eye of Horus, the bird god. The latter is the most rewarding symbol: if you collect 3, 4, or 5, you will receive 3, 7.5, or 25 times your bet, respectively.\n\nThe pharaoh is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Bonus and Amulet symbols. This icon can randomly activate the Random Wilds feature and add 3 or more Wilds to the reels.\n\nThe Pyramid symbol is the Bonus symbol: when it appears on each of the 3 central reels, the Free Spins feature with 10 free spins is activated. Look for the Golden Sticky Wilds that will stick to the pharaohs on the reels, giving you unexpected wins.\n\nThe other symbol to look for is the Amulet symbol: when it appears simultaneously on reels 1 and 5, the Pharaoh Respins feature is activated. With 3 respins assigned, extra wild symbols are randomly added on each respin, also in combination with multipliers up to 3x.\n\nPlease note! Golden Wilds can come together with multipliers and remove low-value symbols to increase your wins. A Golden Wild in the last free spin will give you an additional free round.\n\nMy thoughts on this slot without downloading\nEgyptian King is definitely a highly volatile slot: with a lot of luck, you could win 1,500 times your bet on each Respin or free spin with the 3x multiplier. In the entire Free Spins feature, you can win a total of 8,752 times your overall bet. Among Egyptian-themed slots, this title ranks rather high on the list of this type of plot.

Set inside a pyramid, amidst sacred tombs and ancient symbols linked to the pharaoh's history, the free slot Egyptian King produced by iSoftBet is part of our collection of free online slots with an Egyptian theme. Let's see how it works.\n\nGame structure of the Egyptian King slot without registration:\nThe slot has 5 reels and 20 paylines. Its gameplay ranges from €0.20 up to a limit of €20.00 per spin on all devices. There are 4 bonus features. The Free Spins feature includes Golden Sticky Wilds with multipliers up to 3 times, which will allow you to accumulate big wins. What symbols should you keep an eye on?\n\nAncient and sacred symbology\n\nSymbols include: the standard cards A, K, Q, and J, the Scarabs: Eyes of Ra, Wadjet the cobra goddess, Bastet the cat god, Anubis the dog god, and the Eye of Horus, the bird god. The latter is the most rewarding symbol: if you collect 3, 4, or 5, you will receive 3, 7.5, or 25 times your bet, respectively.\n\nThe pharaoh is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Bonus and Amulet symbols. This icon can randomly activate the Random Wilds feature and add 3 or more Wilds to the reels.\n\nThe Pyramid symbol is the Bonus symbol: when it appears on each of the 3 central reels, the Free Spins feature with 10 free spins is activated. Look for the Golden Sticky Wilds that will stick to the pharaohs on the reels, giving you unexpected wins.\n\nThe other symbol to look for is the Amulet symbol: when it appears simultaneously on reels 1 and 5, the Pharaoh Respins feature is activated. With 3 respins assigned, extra wild symbols are randomly added on each respin, also in combination with multipliers up to 3x.\n\nPlease note! Golden Wilds can come together with multipliers and remove low-value symbols to increase your wins. A Golden Wild in the last free spin will give you an additional free round.\n\nMy thoughts on this slot without downloading\nEgyptian King is definitely a highly volatile slot: with a lot of luck, you could win 1,500 times your bet on each Respin or free spin with the 3x multiplier. In the entire Free Spins feature, you can win a total of 8,752 times your overall bet. Among Egyptian-themed slots, this title ranks rather high on the list of this type of plot. In this regard, I recommend trying out the other free Ancient Egypt slots in our online casinos.\n            ",

It offers four bonus features, including a Free Spins feature with Golden Sticky Wilds that come with multipliers up to 3x. The game also has a Random Wilds feature, which can add three or more wild symbols to the reels. Additionally, the Pharaoh Respins feature is activated when the Amulet symbol appears on reels 1 and 5 simultaneously.\n\nSymbol Choices\n\nThe symbols used in Egyptian King incorporate ancient Egyptian mythology and include standard cards A, K, Q, and J, as well as sacred symbols such as Scarabs, Wadjet the cobra goddess, and Bastet the cat god. The Eye of Horus, the bird god, is the most rewarding symbol, offering 3, 7.5, or 25 times the bet depending on how many are collected.

The latter is the most rewarding symbol: if you collect 3, 4, or 5, you will receive 3, 7.5, or 25 times your bet, respectively.\n\nThe pharaoh is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Bonus and Amulet symbols. This icon can randomly activate the Random Wilds feature and add 3 or more Wilds to the reels.\n\nThe Pyramid symbol is the Bonus symbol: when it appears on each of the 3 central reels, the Free Spins feature with 10 free spins is activated. Look for the Golden Sticky Wilds that will stick to the pharaohs on the reels, giving you unexpected wins.\n\nThe other symbol to look for is the Amulet symbol: when it appears simultaneously on reels 1 and 5, the Pharaoh Respins feature is activated. With 3 respins assigned, extra wild symbols are randomly added on each respin, also in combination with multipliers up to 3x.\n\nPlease note! Golden Wilds can come together with multipliers and remove low-value symbols to increase your wins. A Golden Wild in the last free spin will give you an additional free round.\n\nMy thoughts on this slot without downloading\nEgyptian King is definitely a highly volatile slot: with a lot of luck, you could win 1,500 times your bet on each Respin or free spin with the 3x multiplier. In the entire Free Spins feature, you can win a total of 8,752 times your overall bet. Among Egyptian-themed slots, this title ranks rather high on the list of this type of plot.

Set inside a pyramid, amidst sacred tombs and ancient symbols linked to the pharaoh's history, the free slot Egyptian King produced by iSoftBet is part of our collection of free online slots with an Egyptian theme. Let's see how it works.\n\nGame structure of the Egyptian King slot without registration:\nThe slot has 5 reels and 20 paylines. Its gameplay ranges from €0.20 up to a limit of €20.00 per spin on all devices. There are 4 bonus features. The Free Spins feature includes Golden Sticky Wilds with multipliers up to 3 times, which will allow you to accumulate big wins. What symbols should you keep an eye on?\n\nAncient and sacred symbology\n\nSymbols include: the standard cards A, K, Q, and J, the Scarabs: Eyes of Ra, Wadjet the cobra goddess, Bastet the cat god, Anubis the dog god, and the Eye of Horus, the bird god. The latter is the most rewarding symbol: if you collect 3, 4, or 5, you will receive 3, 7.5, or 25 times your bet, respectively.\n\nThe pharaoh is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Bonus and Amulet symbols. This icon can randomly activate the Random Wilds feature and add 3 or more Wilds to the reels.\n\nThe Pyramid symbol is the Bonus symbol: when it appears on each of the 3 central reels, the Free Spins feature with 10 free spins is activated. Look for the Golden Sticky Wilds that will stick to the pharaohs on the reels, giving you unexpected wins.\n\nThe other symbol to look for is the Amulet symbol: when it appears simultaneously on reels 1 and 5, the Pharaoh Respins feature is activated. With 3 respins assigned, extra wild symbols are randomly added on each respin, also in combination with multipliers up to 3x.\n\nPlease note! Golden Wilds can come together with multipliers and remove low-value symbols to increase your wins. A Golden Wild in the last free spin will give you an additional free round.\n\nMy thoughts on this slot without downloading\nEgyptian King is definitely a highly volatile slot: with a lot of luck, you could win 1,500 times your bet on each Respin or free spin with the 3x multiplier. In the entire Free Spins feature, you can win a total of 8,752 times your overall bet. Among Egyptian-themed slots, this title ranks rather high on the list of this type of plot. In this regard, I recommend trying out the other free Ancient Egypt slots in our online casinos.\n        ",
