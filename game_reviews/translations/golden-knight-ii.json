However, this did not happen with Golden Knight 2, which, in terms of graphics, is practically identical to the previous version and is not particularly convincing.\n\nEven here, there are no three-dimensional animations or special effects in full High 5 Games style.

Finally, the volatility remains the same, with an average level.\n\nIn conclusion, we can say that, apart from some small variations, the gameplay is practically identical, with the same functions and only some extra chances to bring home winnings.\n\nSlot machines similar to the Golden Knight saga\n\nIf you like the theme related to the Middle Ages and love to see swords, horses, and knights on the reels, then we recommend taking a look at the Medieval Money slot, produced by IGT software house.

The provider has shown a preference for dry and linear graphics, with a catalog of products that have not excited the experienced gambler from this point of view.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nWe have seen that the graphic compartment has not been improved, but let's see if there is any merit in releasing a new version when it comes to gameplay and the presence of special features.\n\nThe first novelty of Golden Knight 2 is the fact that it has been optimized to be played not only from desktop computers but also from mobile devices, be they iOS or Android. As a slot with HTML5 format, the game remains fluid and defined, regardless of the screen size.\n\nThe grid is still the traditional one of five reels, four rows, and 40 pay lines. Bets can be made from 1 coin up to a maximum of 400, the latter option will make all high rollers happy.\n\nAnother improvement over the previous version is given by an increased theoretical return to the player (RTP), which has gone from the poor 95% of Golden Knight to a decidedly better 96.5% of this second episode. Finally, the volatility remains the same, with an average level.\n\nIn conclusion, we can say that, apart from some small variations, the gameplay is practically identical, with the same functions and only some extra chances to bring home winnings.\n\nSlot machines similar to the Golden Knight saga\n\nIf you like the theme related to the Middle Ages and love to see swords, horses, and knights on the reels, then we recommend taking a look at the Medieval Money slot, produced by IGT software house. It is an epic battle between knights that moves on five reels and 100 pay lines, offering the chance to win up to 1,000 times the value of the bet.\n        ",
