Crystal Quest Frostlands è il nuovo capitolo della slot targata Thunderkick e ha come protagonista una guerriera che lotta contro degli Jeti demoniaci per nulla amichevoli. Rispetto ai capitoli precedenti, qui cambia giusto qualche funzione e lo scenario di gioco.\nLa schermata si apre con una ragazza immersa nello spazio che cammina su un tappeto di luce mentre ai lati scorrono i tanti bonus a cui potremo aspirare durante il gioco.\nUn paesaggio innevato da cui emergono cristalli di ghiaccio a forma di parallelepipedo fa da sfondo alla griglia di gioco, che non ha una vera e propria cornice in quanto i rulli sono formati da blocchi di ghiaccio che cadono dall’alto.\nSulla destra vengono indicati i moltiplicatori che si possono ottenere durante il gioco regolare, in basso ci sono le informazioni sulla nostra scommessa e a destra i tasti per variare la puntata, per l’Autoplay e per lo Start. Qualche simpatica animazione accompagna le vincite e l’avvio dei giochi bonus, durante gli Spin invece avremo come sottofondo musicale una melodia molto blanda e per nulla disturbante, oltre ai classici effetti sonori, composti soprattutto dal rumore dei lastroni di ghiaccio che si staccano dal soffitto.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nIl sistema di gioco è quello così detto “a cascata”: ogni volta che si ha una combinazione pagante, i simboli esplodono e vengono sostituiti da nuovi simboli che possono dar vita a ulteriori combinazioni vincenti. La griglia di gioco ha 6 rulli e 4 righe e ben 4.096 modi per vincere. La vincita massima è di 15.000 volte la puntata, niente male davvero!\nPossiamo dire che Crystal Quest Frostlands è un gioco adatto a tutti se si tiene conto che le scommesse variano da un minimo di 0,10 € a un massimo di 100 € per ogni giro.\nLa funzione Autoplay ci permette di selezionare da 5 a 5.000 giri automatici, compresi alcuni limiti molto utili perché una volta raggiunti interrompono la funzione, così da non dover tenere sempre sotto controllo il nostro saldo.\nLa volatilità è alta, si vince meno di frequente ma sempre importi di livello, e il valore RTP è pari al 96,16%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nPartiamo col dire che tutti i simboli possono apparire in 3 misure diverse. Quella più piccola è la dimensione di un singolo slot, in quella 2×2 il simbolo occupa 4 slot e nella 3×3 addirittura 9. Ogni volta che si avvia il sistema a cascata, si ottiene un moltiplicatore progressivo che si azzera nel momento in cui si esauriscono le combinazioni vincenti. Le gemme colorate sono i simboli che pagano di meno, ce ne sono ben 9. A seguire troviamo il mostro e infine la guerriera.\nIl simbolo Wild è una W fatta di cristalli, ha funzione di Jolly e sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter.\nLo scrigno dorato è il nostro simbolo Scatter e ci ricompensa con 12 Free Spins. Ogni Scatter aggiuntivo offre 3 giri extra gratuiti. Durante il gioco Bonus le cose cambiano leggermente, perché sono sufficienti 2 Scatter per ottenere 3 giri gratuiti. Quando non si verificano combinazioni vincenti, ogni Wild comparso sulla griglia di gioco distrugge i simboli sul rullo e sulla linea di appartenenza (eccetto gli Scatter), quindi in orizzontale e in verticale. I simboli rimossi verranno poi rimpiazzati da altri simboli. Altra cosa importante è che durante il bonus, il moltiplicatore non si azzera.\n",

The game has a snowy landscape with crystals falling from above in a cascading reels style. This game features a 6x4 grid and an impressive 4096 ways to win.\n\nWinning opportunities and maximum win\n\nThe game offers players a chance to win big with a maximum win of 15,000 times the bet. Although the volatility is high, the RTP value is 96.16%. The game features three different sizes of symbols, each with different values, with the warrior being the highest paying.\n\nBetting range\n\nCrystal Quest Frostlands is suitable for all players with a minimum betting amount of €0.10 and a maximum bet limit of €100 per spin. The AutoPlay setting allows up to 5,000 automatic spins.\n\nGame features: cascading reels, Scatters, Wilds, bonus round\n\nThe game features cascading reels whereby all symbols on winning lines or reels disappear, and new symbols replace them. The game also has Scatter symbols that offer 3 free spins each and a Wild symbol that substitutes all other symbols except the Scatter. During gameplay, when there is a Wild symbol present, all symbols on that line or reel will be destroyed, excluding the Scatter. This will reset the cascading reel mechanism, but it offers a higher potential for additional wins as new symbols replace removed ones. Lastly, there is a bonus game that players can access by landing 3 or more Scatter symbols on the reels. In the bonus round, the multiplier does not reset, and the player can access extra free spins by landing just one Scatter symbol.\n\nOverall game quality and design\n\nCrystal Quest Frostlands is an impressive game that stands out from other slot games with its high-quality design and graphics. The game offers great story-telling with its adventurous warrior fighting against demons. The crystal-clear ice blocks falling from above add to the game's beauty, making it visually appealing.

Look no further than Crystal Quest Frostlands, the latest chapter in Thunderkick's slot series. Here, a warrior fights against demonic yeti to win big prizes. The game features a beautiful space environment with great bonuses that players can aspire to achieve. The snowy landscape background with crystal clear ice blocks falling from above in a cascading reels style. The game grid features 6 reels, 4 rows, and 4096 ways to win. The maximum win is 15,000 times the bet, which is quite impressive! \n\nCrystal Quest Frostlands is suitable for everyone as the bets vary from a minimum of €0.10 to a maximum of €100 per spin. The AutoPlay function allows players to set up to 5,000 automatic spins with useful limiting settings to stop the feature at certain limits.\n\nThe volatility is high, which means players may not win frequently, but every win is at a higher level. The RTP value is 96.16%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nAll symbols come in three different sizes. The smallest is a single slot, followed by a 2×2 symbol that occupies 4 slots and a 3×3 symbol that occupies 9 slots. Each Scatter symbol offers 3 free spins. The colored gems are the lowest paying symbols with 9 variations available, the monster follows and the warrior is the highest paying symbol. The Wild symbol is a W made out of crystals substituting for all symbols except Scatter. \n\nTwo Scatter symbols offer 3 extra free spins during regular play, but during the bonus round, the same is achieved with just one Scatter symbol. During gameplay, whenever there is a Wild symbol present on the reels, all symbols on that line or reel will be destroyed (except Scatter). Therefore, this will reset the cascading reels mechanism but offers a higher potential for subsequent wins as new symbols replace removed ones. It is also worth noting that the multiplier during the bonus round does not reset. \n\nExperience the thrill of the Crystal Quest Frostlands!\n        ",
