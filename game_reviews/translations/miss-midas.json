Miss Midas immagina un protagonista di questa slot tutto al femminile: non abbiamo un Re ma una bellissima regina, con lo stesso fantastico potere.\nPer quanto riguarda il gameplay, si tratta di una slot abbastanza lineare, ma non per questo l’abbiamo trovata noiosa o poco appagante dal punto di vista del divertimento. Non sono presenti giochi bonus ma solo i giri gratis attivabili grazie al simbolo Scatter.\nUnica pecca è il Return To Player piuttosto basso, che si attesta su un non particolarmente entusiasmante 95% e compensato solo in parte da un jackpot che può valere 2500 volte la puntata.\n\nI simboli d’oro di Miss Midas\nLa grafica di questa slot è tutta incentrata sul tema del prezioso metallo e anche i simboli lo riprendono, essendo raffigurati tutti dentro una cornice d’oro.\nSono incorniciati d’oro anche i numeri e le lettere che corrispondono alle carte da poker dal 9 all’Asso: tra tutti i simboli, questi sono quelli che pagano di meno.\nI simboli tematici invece sono quelli che hanno un valore maggiore: tra questi troviamo un castello che si staglia su un cielo viola, un trono, una rosa, un cesto di frutta e un pavone, oltre che naturalmente, Miss Midas in persona.\nMiss Midas non può essere che il Wild del gioco: oltre alla solita funzione di jolly, che permette di sostituire tutti gli altri simboli ad eccezione dello Scatter; inoltre, nel caso in cui compaia su tutti i cinque rulli, Miss Midas paga 500 volte la puntata\nLo Scatter è invece rappresentato dal castello fatato, che oltre a regalare un numero variabile di giri gratuiti, se appare sui rulli per cinque volte determina la vincita più alta in assoluto, pari a 2500 volte la puntata.\n\nFunzione speciale Golden Touch\nSi tratta dell’unico gioco bonus della slot, ed è associata al simbolo Scatter: durante il gioco principale (non si può accedere al Bonus Game quando si giocano i giri gratuiti) grazie a questa funzione alcuni simboli una volta che appaiono sui rulli, sono trasformati in altri diversi, incrementando la possibilità di ottenere delle combinazioni vincenti.\n\nMidas Golden Touch: la versione maschile di Miss Midas!\nSegnaliamo in conclusione la slot machine Midas Golden Touch, prodotta dalla software house Thunderkick, nella quale il protagonista è il Re Mida in persona: anche in questo caso si tratta di un gioco molto “dorato”, con una bella grafica e un jackpot che ammonta a ben 7500 gettoni!\n\n",

This beautiful queen takes center stage in this game and can turn anything she touches into gold.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, the slot is fairly straightforward but not at all boring or unfulfilling for those seeking adventure.

The only downside is the relatively low Return To Player, which is only 95%, compensated only in part by a jackpot that can be worth up to 2500 times the bet.\n\nThe symbols in Miss Midas are all centered around the theme of the precious metal, being depicted within a golden frame.

If it appears on all five reels, Miss Midas pays out 500 times your bet. The Scatter is represented by the enchanted castle and, in addition to offering a variable number of free spins, it also determines the highest possible payout, worth 2500 times your bet.\n\nThe only bonus game in the slot is the Golden Touch, associated with the Scatter symbol: during the main game (you cannot access the Bonus Game when playing free spins), some symbols are transformed into others, increasing your chances of winning.\n\nFinally, we mention the Midas Golden Touch slot machine, produced by the software house Thunderkick, in which King Midas himself is the protagonist.

The only bonus feature is the Golden Touch, activated by the Scatter symbol in the main game. During this feature, symbols are transformed into others, increasing the player's chances of winning. The game offers free spins activated by the Scatter symbol. The RTP is relatively low, at 95%, while the jackpot can be worth up to 2500 times the bet.\n\nTheme and story\n\nMiss Midas is a slot game that imagines a female protagonist with the same fantastic power as King Midas. The game revolves around the theme of gold, from the symbol design to the bonus features. The symbols are depicted within golden frames, with playing cards from 9 to Ace also framed in gold. The game's star, Miss Midas herself, takes center stage in a beautifully designed game that offers a unique twist on Greek mythology.\n\nSymbol design and payouts\n\nAll symbols in Miss Midas fit the game's theme of gold and wealth. The playing cards offer the lowest payouts, while the thematic symbols offer greater rewards, such as a castle against a purple sky, a throne, a rose, a basket of fruit, a peacock, and Miss Midas herself. Miss Midas is the Wild symbol and can replace all other symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by the enchanted castle and offers a variable number of free spins, along with determining the highest possible payout, worth 2500 times the bet. The game offers a 500x payout for those who manage to get the Miss Midas symbol on all five reels.\n\nJackpot and Return To Player\n\nMiss Midas offers a relatively low Return To Player of 95%. However, this may be compensated for some players by the jackpot, which can be worth up to 2500 times the bet. In comparison, the Midas Golden Touch slot machine by Thunderkick, which revolves around King Midas, offers a much higher jackpot of 7500 coins.\n\nOverall enjoyment and entertainment value\n\nMiss Midas offers players an entertaining slot game experience, with a unique female protagonist and a visually stunning design. While the lack of multiple bonus features may be underwhelming for some, the Golden Touch feature and free spins offer enough excitement to keep players engaged. However, the low RTP may deter some players from this game in favor of others with higher payouts. Overall, Miss Midas is a solid choice for those seeking adventure within the realm of slot games.\n\n        \n            ",
