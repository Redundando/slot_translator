Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot machine follows the time traveling adventures of the Metalhead slackers through five reels and 20 paylines.\n\nWhile based on the original 1989 film, the slot game includes real images of the cast, including supporting acts such as Joan of Arc, Napoleon, and Socrates. These characters are the key to the Lock & Respin feature, and the online slot is also equipped with a Wyld Stallyns bonus round that puts extra wild symbols on the reels.\n\nThe game has three rows and five reels that spin on 20 always active paylines. Players can bet with a minimum of 10 cents per spin, and the theoretical return to player is 96.49%, with medium to high variance. Players can enjoy the game with a range of bets and play for a chance to win more than 8000x their bet.\n\nWith graphics that only those who have seen the movie will understand, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot machine features the iconic Circle K store where Bill and Ted first meet Rufus in his time-traveling phone booth. While lower value symbols are simply playing card suits, real images of Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter pay some of the game's biggest prizes, with Rufus and the Princesses returning in the middle of the rankings.\n\nAs rock music plays and the reels of the Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot machine spin, players will be reminded of the legendary sound of Wyld Stallyns - the band destined to bring peace and harmony to the world.\n\nIGT has the license for Bill & Ted slots, and this popular Nevada-based studio has done an excellent job of translating a beloved movie into an online and mobile game. It's not the only movie-themed slot game from IGT, with Ghostbusters and Sherlock Holmes also part of the offering.\n\nPlaying is simple, with all controls and buttons located at the bottom of the reels. The yellow round button is the Spin button, with pressing it deducting the total bet amount from the balance at once. The Autoplay mode can be selected by clicking the blue button to the left of the Spin. Players can choose preset automatic spins and add optional controls such as balance spend limits and a notification when the bonus feature is activated.\n\nBill and Ted fans will love the Wyld Stallyns random feature where landing at least one Ted and one Bill symbol triggers it. This fast game round transforms all Bill and Ted symbols into other wild symbols, giving players a chance to complete additional combinations.\n\nThe main feature of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure online slot is the Lock and Respins round. Landing three or more phone booths simultaneously activates it, but if only two appear, a No Way, Yes Way feature gives a second chance. Rack up five respins and potentially land that all-important third bonus symbol.\n\nIn this spinning reel, every symbol position independently spins three times. Any phone booth symbol reveals prize values ranging from 1x to 100x the bet, or one of the eight historical characters from the film. Phone booths also reset the number of respins to three.\n\nCollect historical characters to claim the jackpot. Some characters update the final jackpots, with the top prize being 2000 coins if all 15 positions on the reels are filled with historical characters in this online slot's feature.\n\nWhatever happens, all phone booth multipliers and any jackpots combine to give the final prize. \n\nSimilar slot games such as Bally's Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Aristocrat's Dumb and Dumber offer more film-themed slot games with multiple features and bonuses."

Rufus and the Princesses return halfway up the ranks.\n\nA rock riff sets the scene as the reels of the Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot machine spin. We're not sure if it's the melody of Wyld Stallyns that's meant to bring peace and harmony to the world, but it sounds good.\n\nIGT has the license for Bill & Ted's slots, and this popular Nevada-based studio has done an interesting job of translating a much-loved film into an online and mobile game. It's not the only themed slot game around popular movies in the IGT range, with Ghostbusters and Sherlock Holmes coming from the same house.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe layout is simple, with all controls and buttons located at the bottom of the reels. The yellow round button is Spin. Pressing it once deducts the total bet amount from the balance at one time. One way to play is in Autoplay.\n\nTo configure this mode, select the blue button to the left of Spin. There, players can choose from pre-set automatic spins and add optional controls such as balance spending limits and giving players a notification when the bonus feature is triggered.\n\nBets on the Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot machine can be selected by pressing the minus and plus buttons located below the second reel. This shows the total bet amount and updates the coin value on the left at the same time. The smallest bet that can be selected is 10 cents, while the largest bets are 30.00 per spin.\n\nThe current balance is shown to the left of the autoplay button, and the window to the left displays the last winning amount. To access the paytable and view detailed information about the game, select the Paytable button in the upper right corner.\n\nLand at least one Ted symbol and one Bill symbol on the reels, and they can trigger the random Wyld Stallyns feature. It's a quick game round that turns all the Bill and Ted symbols into other wild symbols, giving you the chance to complete additional combinations.\n\nThe main feature of the online Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure slot is the Lock and Respins round. You must land three or more phone booths simultaneously to activate it, but if only two appear, a No Way, Yes Way feature gives you a second chance. Wrap up five respins at once, potentially landing that all-important third bonus symbol.\n\nIn this whirlwind, each symbol position spins three times independently. Any phone booth symbol reveals prize values ranging from 1x to 100x the bet, or one of the eight historical characters from the film. Phone booths also reset the number of respins to three.\n\nCollect the historical characters to claim the jackpots. Some characters update final jackpots with the first prize of 2000 coins if all 15 spots on the reels are filled with historical characters in this online Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot feature. \n\nWhatever happens, all phone booth multipliers and any jackpots combine to give the final prize.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nBally's Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is another themed slot game based on a popular movie. Meet Will Ferrell's sexist 1970s newsman on five reels and 25 lines. It's rich in features, such as Ron's Giant Free Games, Brick's Weather Wheel round, and Brian's Sex Panther cologne-based feature.\n\nThe Dumb and Dumber slot comes from Aristocrat. Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey appear on five reels and a 3-4-4-4-3 setup. Spin the dog van bonus wheel to unlock random wilds, free spins, and instant prizes.\n            ",

The Lock & Respin feature and a bonus round of Wyld Stallyns that puts extra wild symbols on the reels make up the game's two primary features. Players can play with a minimum of 10 cents per spin and have a chance at winning more than 8000x multiplied by the bet. The game is very straightforward, with all controls and buttons located at the bottom of the reels, and the graphics will only make sense if you've seen the movie.\n\nPaylines and Betting\n\nPlayers can play Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure with a minimum bet of 10 cents and a maximum bet of 30.00 per spin. The game takes place on three rows and five reels that spin on 20 always active paylines.\n\nReturn to Player and Variance\n\nTheoretical return to the player for Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is 96.49%, and the game's variance is between medium and high.\n\nTheme and Graphics\n\nBill & Ted's Excellent Adventure follows the time-traveling adventures of Metalhead slackers through five reels and 20 paylines. The graphics will only make sense if you've seen the movie. The Circle K store, where Bill and Ted first meet Rufus in his time-traveling phone booth, serves as the background for the game's reels. While lower-value symbols are simply playing card suits, real images of Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter pay some of the biggest prizes. Rufus and the Princesses return halfway up the ranks.\n\nBonus Rounds\n\nBill & Ted's Excellent Adventure features two primary game bonuses. The first is the Lock & Respin feature that requires players to land three or more phone booths simultaneously to activate it. The second is a random Wyld Stallyns feature triggered by landing at least one Bill symbol and one Ted symbol on the reels, which turns all the Bill and Ted symbols into other wild symbols, giving players the chance to complete additional combinations.\n\nLock & Respin Feature\n\nIn the Lock & Respin feature, each symbol position spins three times independently. Any phone booth symbol reveals prize values ranging from 1x to 100x the bet or one of the eight historical characters from the film. Phone booths also reset the number of respins to three. Collect the historical characters to claim the jackpots. Some characters update final jackpots with the first prize of 2000 coins if all 15 spots on the reels are filled with historical characters in this online Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot feature. Whatever happens, all phone booth multipliers and any jackpots combine to give the final prize.\n\nReal Images of Cast\n\nThe Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot game features real images of the cast from the original 1989 film, including supporting acts such as Joan of Arc, Napoleon, and Socrates. These images are key to the Lock & Respin feature\n\n        \n            ",

Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan as they transition from movies to online and mobile casinos. The Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot machine follows the time-traveling adventures of Metalhead slackers through five reels and 20 paylines. \n\nBased on the original 1989 film, the game features real images of the cast, including supporting acts such as Joan of Arc, Napoleon, and Socrates. They are key to the Lock & Respin feature, and the Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure online slot also features a bonus round of Wyld Stallyns that puts extra wild symbols on the reels.\n\nThe game takes place on three rows and five reels that spin on 20 always active paylines. Players can play with a minimum of 10 cents per spin. The theoretical return to the player is 96.49%, and the variance is between medium and high. Players can enjoy the game in a range of bets and play for a chance to win more than 8000x multiplied by the bet.\n\nThe graphics will only make sense if you've seen the movie. The reels rest on the Circle K store, where Bill and Ted first meet Rufus in his time-traveling phone booth. While lower-value symbols are simply playing card suits, real images of Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter pay some of the biggest prizes. Rufus and the Princesses return halfway up the ranks.\n\nA rock riff sets the scene as the reels of the Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot machine spin. We're not sure if it's the melody of Wyld Stallyns that's meant to bring peace and harmony to the world, but it sounds good.\n\nIGT has the license for Bill & Ted's slots, and this popular Nevada-based studio has done an interesting job of translating a much-loved film into an online and mobile game. It's not the only themed slot game around popular movies in the IGT range, with Ghostbusters and Sherlock Holmes coming from the same house.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe layout is simple, with all controls and buttons located at the bottom of the reels. The yellow round button is Spin. Pressing it once deducts the total bet amount from the balance at one time. One way to play is in Autoplay.\n\nTo configure this mode, select the blue button to the left of Spin. There, players can choose from pre-set automatic spins and add optional controls such as balance spending limits and giving players a notification when the bonus feature is triggered.\n\nBets on the Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot machine can be selected by pressing the minus and plus buttons located below the second reel. This shows the total bet amount and updates the coin value on the left at the same time. The smallest bet that can be selected is 10 cents, while the largest bets are 30.00 per spin.\n\nThe current balance is shown to the left of the autoplay button, and the window to the left displays the last winning amount. To access the paytable and view detailed information about the game, select the Paytable button in the upper right corner.\n\nLand at least one Ted symbol and one Bill symbol on the reels, and they can trigger the random Wyld Stallyns feature. It's a quick game round that turns all the Bill and Ted symbols into other wild symbols, giving you the chance to complete additional combinations.\n\nThe main feature of the online Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure slot is the Lock and Respins round. You must land three or more phone booths simultaneously to activate it, but if only two appear, a No Way, Yes Way feature gives you a second chance. Wrap up five respins at once, potentially landing that all-important third bonus symbol.\n\nIn this whirlwind, each symbol position spins three times independently. Any phone booth symbol reveals prize values ranging from 1x to 100x the bet, or one of the eight historical characters from the film. Phone booths also reset the number of respins to three.\n\nCollect the historical characters to claim the jackpots. Some characters update final jackpots with the first prize of 2000 coins if all 15 spots on the reels are filled with historical characters in this online Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot feature. \n\nWhatever happens, all phone booth multipliers and any jackpots combine to give the final prize.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nBally's Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is another themed slot game based on a popular movie. Meet Will Ferrell's sexist 1970s newsman on five reels and 25 lines. It's rich in features, such as Ron's Giant Free Games, Brick's Weather Wheel round, and Brian's Sex Panther cologne-based feature.\n\nThe Dumb and Dumber slot comes from Aristocrat. Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey appear on five reels and a 3-4-4-4-3 setup. Spin the dog van bonus wheel to unlock random wilds, free spins, and instant prizes.\n            ",

We're not sure if it's the melody of Wyld Stallyns that's meant to bring peace and harmony to the world, but it sounds good.\n\nIGT has the license for Bill & Ted's slots, and this popular Nevada-based studio has done an interesting job of translating a much-loved film into an online and mobile game. It's not the only themed slot game around popular movies in the IGT range, with Ghostbusters and Sherlock Holmes coming from the same house.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe layout is simple, with all controls and buttons located at the bottom of the reels. The yellow round button is Spin. Pressing it once deducts the total bet amount from the balance at one time. One way to play is in Autoplay.\n\nTo configure this mode, select the blue button to the left of Spin. There, players can choose from pre-set automatic spins and add optional controls such as balance spending limits and giving players a notification when the bonus feature is triggered.\n\nBets on the Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot machine can be selected by pressing the minus and plus buttons located below the second reel. This shows the total bet amount and updates the coin value on the left at the same time. The smallest bet that can be selected is 10 cents, while the largest bets are 30.00 per spin.\n\nThe current balance is shown to the left of the autoplay button, and the window to the left displays the last winning amount. To access the paytable and view detailed information about the game, select the Paytable button in the upper right corner.\n\nLand at least one Ted symbol and one Bill symbol on the reels, and they can trigger the random Wyld Stallyns feature. It's a quick game round that turns all the Bill and Ted symbols into other wild symbols, giving you the chance to complete additional combinations.\n\nThe main feature of the online Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure slot is the Lock and Respins round. You must land three or more phone booths simultaneously to activate it, but if only two appear, a No Way, Yes Way feature gives you a second chance. Wrap up five respins at once, potentially landing that all-important third bonus symbol.\n\nIn this whirlwind, each symbol position spins three times independently. Any phone booth symbol reveals prize values ranging from 1x to 100x the bet, or one of the eight historical characters from the film. Phone booths also reset the number of respins to three.\n\nCollect the historical characters to claim the jackpots. Some characters update final jackpots with the first prize of 2000 coins if all 15 spots on the reels are filled with historical characters in this online Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure slot feature. \n\nWhatever happens, all phone booth multipliers and any jackpots combine to give the final prize.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nBally's Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is another themed slot game based on a popular movie. Meet Will Ferrell's sexist 1970s newsman on five reels and 25 lines. It's rich in features, such as Ron's Giant Free Games, Brick's Weather Wheel round, and Brian's Sex Panther cologne-based feature.\n\nThe Dumb and Dumber slot comes from Aristocrat. Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey appear on five reels and a 3-4-4-4-3 setup. Spin the dog van bonus wheel to unlock random wilds, free spins, and instant prizes.\n        ",
