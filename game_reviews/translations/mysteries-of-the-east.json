    "original_text": "\nMysteries of the East\nLasciati trasportare in terre lontane, alla ricerca di premi che possono capitare sul tuo percorso in modo del tutto naturale. Mysteries Of The East è una slot che ripropone il tema del Giappone, ricostruendo le attività tipiche di un gioco da tavolo. Sembra un po’ di essere davanti al celebre Gioco dell’Oca, con un percorso preciso da affrontare, muovendosi di casella in casella. Il movimento della protagonista sarà scandito dal punteggio che ottieni tirando un dado. La slot, rilasciata nell’aprile 2021 da Evoplay, è caratterizzata da un gameplay semplice, intuitivo e una struttura che non ha nulla a che vedere con una macchinetta online classica. Ha un RTP al 96,06%, utilizza la tecnologia HTML5 e si presenta come un gioco unico di roll and move, che la rende molto più concettuale di molti altri giochi di slot online. Di seguito scopriremo quali sono le sue caratteristiche, parendo anche dal suo jackpot che permette di arrivare ad alti livelli di moltiplicatori che potrai collezionare mentre l’affascinante Keiko ti guiderà alla ricerca di vincite e denaro.\nCaratteristiche e grafica della slot\nIl design della slot è molto carino, semplice ma divertente. Come accennato poco fa si pare da un simil tabellone del gioco dell’Oca, con diverse caselle che rappresentano i passi e i percorsi che la protagonista può percorrere. Sullo sfondo abbiamo una foresta asiatica colorata e vivace, ma capace di donare un senso di grande calma. Il giocatore può impostare la propria scommessa e modificarla in qualsiasi momento, ma ogni volta che la cambia dovrà ripartire dall’inizio, perdendo i progressi fatti durante il suo viaggio.\nTutto ciò che bisogna fare è lanciare il dado e avanzare nel percorso, cercando di evitare le caselle con i buchi nel terreno. Sono previste due funzionalità precise, ovvero Speed Booster e il Bonus Game di cui parleremo nel prossimo capitolo.\nFunzionalità speciali\nCon lo Speed Booster il personaggio principale incontra la casella che riporta il simbolo di una volpe. In questo caso tutti i punti che si ottengono con i dadi vengono raddoppiati fino al momento in cui resta attiva la funzione. Nel caso in cui Keiko arrivi al cancello si attiva invece la funzione Bonus Game e si viene trasportati in un mini gioco con tre scrigni. Bisogna scegliere una delle casse e si potrà ottenere la ricompensa che è contenuta al suo interno. Piccolo spoiler: è possibile mettere mano su un moltiplicatore fino a 20x. È possibile aprire 4 porte e man mano che si va avanti più alte saranno le ricompense.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Mysteries of the East\nLa slot Mysteries Of The East è un moderno gioco di dadi che è stato digitalizzato e adattato alle scommesse di una slot online. Sono carine le sue funzionalità e le ricompense che si possono vincere sono molto alte. Tutto questo rende l’esperienza di gioco e il gameplay molto interessante e piacevole.\n",

Players roll dice to progress along a path, with various squares representing different steps and paths to follow. The heroine's movements are dictated by the roll of the dice, providing a unique and immersive gameplay experience.\n\nDesign and atmosphere\n\nThe game's design is cute, simple, and fun, with a colorful, lively Asian forest background that provides a sense of great calm. The board game-style layout offers a refreshing break from more traditional online slot games, with various squares representing different steps and paths to follow. Players can adjust their bets at any time, but doing so will reset their progress, so be careful!\n\nFunctions: Speed Booster and Bonus Game\n\nMysteries of the East offers two main special functions. With the Speed Booster function, the main character encounters a square marked with the symbol of a fox. All points earned with the dice are consequently doubled until the function is disabled. Alternatively, if Keiko reaches the gate, the Bonus Game function is activated, and you're transported to a mini-game with three chests. Choose one, and you'll receive whatever prize is contained inside. The rewards increase with each chest you open.\n\nRewards and progression\n\nMysteries of the East has an RTP of 96.06%, making it a potentially lucrative online slot game. The jackpot features high-level multipliers, offering players the potential for significant winnings. The game also features a unique progression system, with players moving along a predetermined path to discover various rewards and bonuses along the way. Be careful when adjusting your bets, however, as doing so will reset your progress!\n\nOverall experience\n\nMysteries of the East is a refreshing and engaging online slot game that offers a unique gameplay experience. The game's board game-style layout, along with its fun functions and potential for high rewards, makes it a must-try for experienced and novice gamblers alike. Whether you're looking for something new or simply want to take a break from traditional online slot games, Mysteries of the East is definitely worth checking out!\n\n        \n            ",

Mysteries of the East is a slot game that embraces all things Japanese, reimagining classic board games in a modern and exciting new format. It's reminiscent of the game of Snakes and Ladders, with a precise path to navigate and progress to be made from square to square. The heroine's movements are dictated by the roll of the dice, providing a unique and engaging gameplay experience unlike any other online slot.\n\nReleased in April 2021 by Evoplay, Mysteries of the East boasts an impressive RTP of 96.06% and uses HTML5 technology.
