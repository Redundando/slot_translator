Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\nCount Jokula is an online slot game that features three reels and five fixed paylines. The minimum bet per spin is €0.05, while the maximum is €100. In the game, the Joker Wild symbol replaces all high and low-paying symbols. The Shapeshifter feature during the base game allows the bat symbol to randomly transform into a Joker Wild and form a winning combination.\n\nGraphics\n\nCount Jokula's graphics are spooky and entertaining. The symbols are designed based on the theme of the slot game, and the background of the game is Count Jokula's castle. The overall aesthetic of the game is atmospheric and goes well with the Halloween vibe.\n\nBonus Features\n\nCount Jokula's bonus features include the Respins of Evil round, which can be activated when a winning combination is formed with the Joker Wild symbol on the center reel. During this round, a multiplier meter above the reels is launched up to a maximum of x20, and the Joker Wild symbol becomes sticky for the 25 available respins. The Joker Wild symbol is also crucial in helping to create winning combinations that trigger the Respins of Evil.\n\nTheme and Storyline\n\nCount Jokula is part of the Fruit Joker slot series, with the haunted Count Dracula as the main theme. The game is designed to be spooky, and the symbols, graphics, and background music are all meant to reflect this theme. The storyline is not a central focus of the slot game, but players will appreciate the overall Halloween vibe the game gives off.\n\nPayouts\n\nCount Jokula has a theoretical RTP of 96.22% and a maximum win potential of 8,350x. The most rewarding regular symbol is the bat, followed by the sword and chalice. Low-paying symbols include plums, grapes, lemons, and cherries. Betting options range from €0.05 to €100 per round, with many other options available. The variance of Count Jokula falls within the medium range.\n\n        \n            ",

Keep an eye out for the Joker Wild as it transforms bat symbols on the reels into winning icons, and face the Respins of Evil round, where you can earn a multiplier of up to x20 and a maximum of 25 Respins! Are you brave enough to enter Count Jokula's castle?\n\nCount Jokula's base game consists of three reels with five fixed paylines. The minimum bet per spin is €0.05, while the maximum is €100 per round, with many other betting options available. Count Jokula has a theoretical RTP of 96.22% and a maximum win potential of 8,350x.\n\nIn terms of symbols, the most rewarding regular symbol is the bat, followed by the sword and chalice. Low-paying symbols include plums, grapes, lemons, and cherries. There's also a Joker Wild, which replaces all high and low-paying icons.\n\nDespite having only three reels, Play'n GO has managed to include a fun Shapeshifter feature during the base game. How does it work? If the bat symbol stops on any of the reels, it can randomly transform into a Joker Wild and form a winning combination.\n\nWhen is the Respins of Evil round activated? During the base game, if a winning combination is formed with the Joker Wild on the center reel, the Respins of Evil round will be activated, and a multiplier meter above the reels will come into play, up to a maximum of x20. The Joker Wild symbol on the center reel will also become sticky and remain in place for the entire duration of the 25 available Respins.\n\nMy verdict on Count Jokula: Despite Halloween being over, providers like Play'n GO have chosen to make the most out of this holiday by favoring spooky themes and a particular reference to the legendary Count Dracula for this online slot. While the gameplay may seem simple at first glance, with only three reels and five paylines (like many slots in the Joker series), Count Jokula has the potential to surprise with a maximum win limit of 8,350 times the bet. Overall, Count Jokula is a fun slot to celebrate the Halloween season, regardless of the time of year, both in Demo mode and with real money in one of the AAMS-ADM licensed casinos in our catalog.\n\nFAQs:\n\nHow do I activate the Respins of Evil in the slot Count Jokula? \n\nThey are activated when a Joker/Jokula hits the center reel, helping to form a winning combination up to a maximum of 25 consecutive Respins with a multiplier value of up to 20x.\n\nWhat is the RTP value of the vampire slot Count Jokula? \n\nCount Jokula has an RTP of 96.22%, which is a typical value for many titles from this provider. In terms of variance, this video slot falls within the medium range.\n\nIs there a demo version of Count Jokula? \n\nYes, the demo version of Count Jokula is available here on Slotjava. Chase Respins and Joker Wilds on desktop, mobile, and/or tablet devices.\n        ",
