Ad ogni giro, vedrete questo motore prendere vita con gli ingranaggi che girano e il vapore che si aggiungono all’atmosfera rustica di questo gioco.\nUna grafica steampunk\nTutti i simboli si ispirano alle classiche slot con un tocco steampunk: i semi delle carte da gioco, con il Re della Diesel, la Regina del vapore e il Jack del Punk come protagonisti di questa avventura steampunk.\nI simboli che pagano meno prendono la forma di cuori, mazze, picche e diamanti, tutti creati utilizzando pezzi di metallo di scarto, motori e ingranaggi per dare loro un rifacimento industriale.\nPoiché i personaggi principali sono anche simbolici delle carte da gioco, appaiono sia capovolti che in posizione verticale e sono impilati per mostrare tutta la loro potenza quando riempiono un mulinello.

Se sei in grado di abbinare il Re con alcuni moltiplicatori Hot Wild, questo 200x potrebbe aumentare a 400x o anche 2.000x la tua scommessa, facendo alcune incredibilmente redditizie ricchezze reali da vincere.\nCome suggerisce il nome ‘Hot Nudge’, la principale caratteristica bonus di questo gioco grungy sono le gomitate prestate agli Hot Wilds e al Re, Regina e Jack di steampunk, facendo sì che questi simboli prendano il sopravvento su interi rulli quando la situazione è giusta.\nPer gli Hot Wild, questo simbolo con una meccanica femminile in pantaloni caldi e un cappuccio si spinge verso l’alto o verso il basso se anche solo una parte di esso si mostra su un mulinello per riempire lo spazio disponibile. Con ogni gomitata otterrete un moltiplicatore aggiuntivo alle vostre vincite con il massimo disponibile di x10. Potete tenere traccia dei vostri moltiplicatori nell’angolo in alto a destra della bobina del motore.

            "response": "Hot Nudge\nSome game designers may shy away from an industrial-style slot, but not NoLimit City. In this steampunk-inspired slot, you'll be faced with a giant engine, gears, and machinery suitable for a post-apocalyptic era in this five-reel, four-row, and 40 payline slot.\n\nUsing cartoon-style graphics, this game takes you to the heart of the steampunk existence, while you face a huge engine that makes up the reels. With each spin, you'll see this engine come to life with gears turning and steam adding to the rustic atmosphere of this game.\n\nSteampunk Graphics\nAll symbols are inspired by classic slots with a steampunk twist: the playing card suits, with the Diesel King, the Steam Queen and the Punk Jack as the protagonists of this steampunk adventure.\n\nThe lower paying symbols take the form of hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds, all created using scrap metal pieces, motors, and gears to give them an industrial remake.\n\nSince the main characters are also symbolic of playing cards, they appear both upside down and in vertical position and stack to show all of their power when they fill a reel. Clearly, care has been devoted to the design of these symbols, as the personality of the three main characters can be perceived through the images.\n\nAlthough not a paying symbol in itself, Hot Wild is extremely profitable because it also appears stacked and comes into position to fully fill any reel it lands on. Appropriately, the Hot Wild character is a female mechanic - the perfect image for a symbol that \"fixes\" paylines to pay more.\n\nThe Wild can replace any symbol other than the Scatter to create the potential for huge wins. The Hot Scatter in this game is illustrated in a beloved yellow warning sign with the words \"Hot Scatter\". This is the only symbol that does not appear stacked and will randomly appear on one of the three center reels. Finding three Scatters unlocks free spins in Hot Nudge.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nTo win in Hot Nudge, simply find three or more matching symbols along any of the generous 40 fixed paylines starting from the far left reel. The Hot Wild symbol can replace any symbol other than the Scatter to extend your match rows and will appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 and elbow its way to fill entire reels, adding a multiplier for every position it moves. Find a part of a Hot Wild on all three possible rows to get a massive x10 multiplier for every win.\n\nKeep an eye on one of the character symbols to fill all four rows on reels 1 and 2 to see their corresponding symbols push to fill all four rows on any other reel they land on.\n\nThe lower paying card symbols will pay between 2x and 5x your stake when five of a kind are matched along a payline. Although this doesn't seem like a big win, considering the stacked nature of the symbols in Hot Nudge and the 40 available paylines, this can quickly add up when you're able to find matching symbols on multiple paylines, especially when the Hot Wild multipliers come into play.\n\nThe maximum win in the base game is 200x your stake when the Diesel King graces all five reels with his presence. If you're able to match the King with some Hot Wild multipliers, this 200x could increase to 400x or even 2,000x your bet, making some incredibly profitable real riches to be won.\n\nAs the name 'Hot Nudge' suggests, the main bonus feature of this grungy game are the nudges given to the Hot Wilds and the steampunk King, Queen, and Jack characters, causing these symbols to take over entire reels when the situation is right.\n\nFor Hot Wilds, this symbol with a female mechanic in hot pants and a hood pushes up or down if even a part of it is shown on a reel to fill the available space. With each nudge, you'll get an additional multiplier to your winnings with the maximum available of x10. You can keep track of your multipliers in the top right corner of the engine reel. Multipliers last only for the spin they are generated on, so you'll have to start from scratch for the next spin.\n\nIf any of the character symbols - the Diesel King, Steam Queen, or Punk Jack - fills all four rows of the first two reels, even the corresponding appearance of their symbols pushes to fill the set of reels on which they appear.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you like Hot Nudge, you'll love Cazino Zeppelin. There's not much more steampunk than a Zeppelin, and this Yggdrasil Gaming slot offers a great adventure experience with Victorian inventors, transferring and sticky Wilds, and a generous bonus feature.",

In this steampunk-inspired slot, you'll find yourself face to face with a large engine, gears, and machinery suitable for a post-apocalyptic era in this five-reel, four-row, and 40 payline game.\n\nUsing cartoon-style graphics, this game takes you to the heart of steampunk existence as you face a massive engine that makes up the reels. With each spin, you'll see this engine come to life with gears turning, and steam adding to the rustic atmosphere of this game.\n\nSteampunk graphics\nAll symbols are inspired by classic slots with a steampunk twist: the playing card suits, with the Diesel King, Steam Queen, and Punk Jack as the protagonists of this steampunk adventure.\n\nThe lower-paying symbols take the form of hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds, all created using scrap metal pieces, motors, and gears to give them an industrial makeover.\n\nAs the main characters are also symbolic of playing cards, they appear both upside down and upright and are stacked to show their full power when they fill a reel. Clearly, care has been taken with the design of these symbols, as the personality of the three main characters can be perceived through the images.\n\nAlthough not a paying symbol in itself, Hot Wild is extremely profitable because it also appears stacked and positions itself to fill any reel it lands on completely. Appropriately, the Hot Wild character is a female mechanic-the perfect image for a symbol that \"fixes\" paylines to pay more.\n\nThe wild can replace any symbol that is not the scatter to create the potential for huge wins. The Hot Scatter in this game is illustrated on a beloved yellow warning sign with the words \"Hot Scatter\". This is the only symbol that does not appear stacked and will appear randomly on one of the three central reels. Finding three scatters unlocks free spins in Hot Nudge.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nTo win at Hot Nudge, simply find three or more matching symbols along any of the generous 40 fixed paylines starting from the far-left reel. The Hot Wild symbol can replace any symbol other than the scatter to extend your matching rows and will appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, jostling to fill entire reels, adding a multiplier for each position it moves. Find a part of a Hot Wild on all three possible rows to get a massive x10 multiplier for each win.\n\nKeep an eye on one of the character symbols to fill all four rows in reels 1 and 2 to see their corresponding symbols push to fill all four rows on any other reel they land on.\n\nThe lower paying card symbols will pay out between 2x and 5x their stake when five of a kind are matched along a payline. Although this doesn't seem like a big win, considering the stacked nature of the symbols in Hot Nudge and the available 40 paylines, this can quickly add up when you're able to find matching symbols on multiple paylines, particularly when Hot Wild multipliers come into play.\n\nThe maximum win in the base game is 200x your stake when the Diesel King graces all five reels with his presence. If you can match the King with some Hot Wild multipliers, this 200x could increase to 400x or even 2,000x your bet, making for some incredibly profitable real money rewards to be won.\n\nAs the name 'Hot Nudge' suggests, the main bonus feature of this grungy game is the nudges offered to Hot Wilds and the steampunk Diesel, Queen, and Jack symbols, causing these symbols to take over entire reels when the situation is right.\n\nFor Hot Wilds, this symbol featuring a female mechanic in hot pants and a hood pushes up or down if even only a part of it shows on a reel to fill the available space. With each nudge, you'll get an additional multiplier to your winnings with the maximum available at x10. You can keep track of your multipliers in the top right corner of the engine reel. Multipliers last only for the spin on which they are generated, so you'll have to start from scratch for the next spin.\n\nIf any of the character symbols-the Diesel King, Steam Queen, or Punk Jack-fills all four rows of the first two reels, their corresponding appearance will also push to fill the set of reels on which they appear.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like Hot Nudge, you'll love Cazino Zeppelin. There isn't much more steampunk than a Zeppelin, and this Yggdrasil Gaming slot offers a great adventure experience with Victorian inventors, transferring and sticky wilds, and a generous bonus feature."

With each spin, you'll see this engine come to life with gears turning, and steam adding to the rustic atmosphere of this game.\n\nSteampunk graphics\nAll symbols are inspired by classic slots with a steampunk twist: the playing card suits, with the Diesel King, Steam Queen, and Punk Jack as the protagonists of this steampunk adventure.\n\nThe lower-paying symbols take the form of hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds, all created using scrap metal pieces, motors, and gears to give them an industrial makeover.\n\nAs the main characters are also symbolic of playing cards, they appear both upside down and upright and are stacked to show their full power when they fill a reel. Clearly, care has been taken with the design of these symbols, as the personality of the three main characters can be perceived through the images.\n\nAlthough not a paying symbol in itself, Hot Wild is extremely profitable because it also appears stacked and positions itself to fill any reel it lands on completely. Appropriately, the Hot Wild character is a female mechanic-the perfect image for a symbol that \"fixes\" paylines to pay more.\n\nThe wild can replace any symbol that is not the scatter to create the potential for huge wins. The Hot Scatter in this game is illustrated on a beloved yellow warning sign with the words \"Hot Scatter\". This is the only symbol that does not appear stacked and will appear randomly on one of the three central reels. Finding three scatters unlocks free spins in Hot Nudge.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nTo win at Hot Nudge, simply find three or more matching symbols along any of the generous 40 fixed paylines starting from the far-left reel. The Hot Wild symbol can replace any symbol other than the scatter to extend your matching rows and will appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, jostling to fill entire reels, adding a multiplier for each position it moves. Find a part of a Hot Wild on all three possible rows to get a massive x10 multiplier for each win.\n\nKeep an eye on one of the character symbols to fill all four rows in reels 1 and 2 to see their corresponding symbols push to fill all four rows on any other reel they land on.\n\nThe lower paying card symbols will pay out between 2x and 5x their stake when five of a kind are matched along a payline. Although this doesn't seem like a big win, considering the stacked nature of the symbols in Hot Nudge and the available 40 paylines, this can quickly add up when you're able to find matching symbols on multiple paylines, particularly when Hot Wild multipliers come into play.\n\nThe maximum win in the base game is 200x your stake when the Diesel King graces all five reels with his presence. If you can match the King with some Hot Wild multipliers, this 200x could increase to 400x or even 2,000x your bet, making for some incredibly profitable real money rewards to be won.\n\nAs the name 'Hot Nudge' suggests, the main bonus feature of this grungy game is the nudges offered to Hot Wilds and the steampunk Diesel, Queen, and Jack symbols, causing these symbols to take over entire reels when the situation is right.\n\nFor Hot Wilds, this symbol featuring a female mechanic in hot pants and a hood pushes up or down if even only a part of it shows on a reel to fill the available space. With each nudge, you'll get an additional multiplier to your winnings with the maximum available at x10. You can keep track of your multipliers in the top right corner of the engine reel. Multipliers last only for the spin on which they are generated, so you'll have to start from scratch for the next spin.\n\nIf any of the character symbols-the Diesel King, Steam Queen, or Punk Jack-fills all four rows of the first two reels, their corresponding appearance will also push to fill the set of reels on which they appear.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like Hot Nudge, you'll love Cazino Zeppelin. There isn't much more steampunk than a Zeppelin, and this Yggdrasil Gaming slot offers a great adventure experience with Victorian inventors, transferring and sticky wilds, and a generous bonus feature.\n            ",

Players will find themselves immersed in a post-apocalyptic world, staring face to face with a massive engine, gears, and machinery.\n\nGame Features\n\nHot Nudge offers exciting features that make gameplay even more engaging. Players can expect Hot Wild and Hot Scatter symbols and nudges. The Hot Wild symbol can replace any symbol except the scatter and appear stacked. The Hot Scatter unlocks free spins when three are found. The nudges can extend matching reels when Hot Wilds or character symbols fill up an entire reel.\n\nSymbol Payouts\n\nHot Nudge includes steampunk-inspired symbols suited for a Victorian-era, and these symbols offer various payouts. The lower-paying symbols such as hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds can multipliers for each position they move. In contrast, the higher paying symbols such as the Diesel King, Steam Queen, and Punk Jack symbols, which are stacked, offer generous payouts up to 2,000x players' bet. \n\nHot Nudge Feature\n\nThe Hot Nudge feature in the game is offered through the nudges that Hot Wilds or character symbols like Diesel King, Steam Queen, and Punk Jack offer. If Hot Wilds appear partially on a reel, they'll push up or down to fill the full reel, adding a multiplier every time they move. If any of the character symbols fill all four rows of the first two reels, their corresponding appearance will also push to fill the set of reels on which they appear. \n\nHot Wild Symbol\n\nThe Hot Wild symbol is one of the game's most profitable symbols as it appears stacked and can fill any reel it lands on completely to extend matching rows. The Hot Wilds also offer multipliers as they move in the nudges. Players can get up to a x10 multiplier when parts of a Hot Wild appear on all three possible rows. \n\nHot Scatter Symbol\n\nThe Hot Scatter symbol is illustrated on a yellow warning sign that reads \"Hot Scatter.\" Players can unlock free spins by finding three of these scatters randomly on one of the three central reels. \n\nRelated Games\n\nIf players like Hot Nudge, they may enjoy other steampunk-themed slot games like Cazino Zeppelin by Yggdrasil Gaming. Cazino Zeppelin offers a similar industrial vibe and steampunk-inspired symbols, and includes bonus features such as transferring and sticky wilds and a lucrative bonus game.\n\n        \n            ",

To win, players need to find three or more matching symbols along any of the 40 fixed paylines. A Hot Wild symbol can replace any symbol except the scatter to extend matching rows. The Hot Scatter is the only symbol that does not appear stacked and will trigger free spins when three scatters appear on the central reels. The main bonus feature of the game is the nudges offered to Hot Wilds and the steampunk Diesel, Queen, and Jack symbols, causing these symbols to take over entire reels when the situation is right.\n\nDesign and Graphics\n\nHot Nudge's unique industrial-style graphics are inspired by steampunk aesthetics. Cartoon-style images depict a massive engine that makes up the reels with steam and cogs adding to the rustic atmosphere of the game. The Diesel King, Steam Queen, and Punk Jack are the main characters symbols and are all stacked to show their full power when they fill a reel. The lower paying symbols are hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds, all created using scrap metal pieces, motors, and gears. These symbols are also crafted to fit with the overarching steampunk theme.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nAll symbols in Hot Nudge are inspired by classic slots with a steampunk twist. The Diesel King, Steam Queen, and Punk Jack are the main characters symbols, while the lower paying symbols are hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds, all created using scrap metal pieces, motors, and gears. To win, players need to find three or more matching symbols along any of the 40 fixed paylines. The maximum win in the base game is 200x your stake when the Diesel King graces all five reels with his presence.\n\nHot Scatter and Wild Symbols\n\nThe Hot Wild symbol appears stacked and can replace any symbol other than the scatter to extend matching rows. The Hot Scatter symbol is illustrated on a beloved yellow warning sign with the words 'Hot Scatter.' This symbol is the only one that does not appear stacked and will randomly appear on one of the three central reels. Triggering three scatters will unlock free spins in Hot Nudge.\n\nHot Nudge Feature\n\nThe main bonus feature in Hot Nudge is the nudges offered to Hot Wilds and the steampunk Diesel, Queen, and Jack symbols. If any of the character symbols-the Diesel King, Steam Queen, or Punk Jack-fills all four rows of the first two reels, their corresponding appearance will also push to fill the set of reels on which they appear. For Hot Wilds, this symbol featuring a female mechanic in hot pants and a hood pushes up or down if even only a part of it shows on a reel to fill the available space. With each nudge, players receive an additional multiplier to their winnings, with the maximum being x10. Multipliers last only for the spin on which they are generated, so players start from scratch for the next spin.\n\nMaximum Win\n\nThe maximum win in the base game is 200x your stake when the Diesel King symbol appears on all five reels. However, if the King symbol matches some Hot Wild multipliers, this 200x could increase to 400x or even to 2,000x your bet, thus leading to some substantial real money rewards.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nThose who enjoy Hot Nudge might appreciate other games such as Cazino Zeppelin, another steampunk-inspired game by Yggdrasil Gaming. This title offers a similar experience, complete with Victorian inventors, transferring and sticky wilds, and a generous bonus feature.\n\n        \n            ",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a review of the game \"Hot Nudge\".\n\nPlease provide an FAQ:\n\n- 8 questions\n- Use simple language and provide practical takeaways.\n- Respond with a JSON!\n- Use the key \"faq\" and an array with the keys \"question\" and \"answer\". \n\nReview: Hot Nudge\n\nSome game designers might shy away from an industrial style slot game, but not NoLimit City. In this steampunk-inspired slot, you'll find yourself face to face with a large engine, gears, and machinery suitable for a post-apocalyptic era in this five-reel, four-row, and 40 payline game.\n\nUsing cartoon-style graphics, this game takes you to the heart of steampunk existence as you face a massive engine that makes up the reels. With each spin, you'll see this engine come to life with gears turning, and steam adding to the rustic atmosphere of this game.\n\nSteampunk graphics\nAll symbols are inspired by classic slots with a steampunk twist: the playing card suits, with the Diesel King, Steam Queen, and Punk Jack as the protagonists of this steampunk adventure.\n\nThe lower-paying symbols take the form of hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds, all created using scrap metal pieces, motors, and gears to give them an industrial makeover.\n\nAs the main characters are also symbolic of playing cards, they appear both upside down and upright and are stacked to show their full power when they fill a reel. Clearly, care has been taken with the design of these symbols, as the personality of the three main characters can be perceived through the images.\n\nAlthough not a paying symbol in itself, Hot Wild is extremely profitable because it also appears stacked and positions itself to fill any reel it lands on completely. Appropriately, the Hot Wild character is a female mechanic-the perfect image for a symbol that \"fixes\" paylines to pay more.\n\nThe wild can replace any symbol that is not the scatter to create the potential for huge wins. The Hot Scatter in this game is illustrated on a beloved yellow warning sign with the words \"Hot Scatter\". This is the only symbol that does not appear stacked and will appear randomly on one of the three central reels. Finding three scatters unlocks free spins in Hot Nudge.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nTo win at Hot Nudge, simply find three or more matching symbols along any of the generous 40 fixed paylines starting from the far-left reel. The Hot Wild symbol can replace any symbol other than the scatter to extend your matching rows and will appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, jostling to fill entire reels, adding a multiplier for each position it moves. Find a part of a Hot Wild on all three possible rows to get a massive x10 multiplier for each win.\n\nKeep an eye on one of the character symbols to fill all four rows in reels 1 and 2 to see their corresponding symbols push to fill all four rows on any other reel they land on.\n\nThe lower paying card symbols will pay out between 2x and 5x their stake when five of a kind are matched along a payline. Although this doesn't seem like a big win, considering the stacked nature of the symbols in Hot Nudge and the available 40 paylines, this can quickly add up when you're able to find matching symbols on multiple paylines, particularly when Hot Wild multipliers come into play.\n\nThe maximum win in the base game is 200x your stake when the Diesel King graces all five reels with his presence. If you can match the King with some Hot Wild multipliers, this 200x could increase to 400x or even 2,000x your bet, making for some incredibly profitable real money rewards to be won.\n\nAs the name 'Hot Nudge' suggests, the main bonus feature of this grungy game is the nudges offered to Hot Wilds and the steampunk Diesel, Queen, and Jack symbols, causing these symbols to take over entire reels when the situation is right.\n\nFor Hot Wilds, this symbol featuring a female mechanic in hot pants and a hood pushes up or down if even only a part of it shows on a reel to fill the available space. With each nudge, you'll get an additional multiplier to your winnings with the maximum available at x10. You can keep track of your multipliers in the top right corner of the engine reel. Multipliers last only for the spin on which they are generated, so you'll have to start from scratch for the next spin.\n\nIf any of the character symbols-the Diesel King, Steam Queen, or Punk Jack-fills all four rows of the first two reels, their corresponding appearance will also push to fill the set of reels on which they appear.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like Hot Nudge, you'll love Cazino Zeppelin. There isn't much more steampunk than a Zeppelin, and this Yggdrasil Gaming slot offers a great adventure experience with Victorian inventors, transferring and sticky wilds, and a generous bonus feature.\n            ",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a review of the game \"Hot Nudge\".\n\nPlease provide an FAQ:\n\n- 8 questions\n- Use simple language and provide practical takeaways.\n- Respond with a JSON!\n- Use the key \"faq\" and an array with the keys \"question\" and \"answer\". \n\nReview: Hot Nudge\n\nSome game designers might shy away from an industrial style slot game, but not NoLimit City. In this steampunk-inspired slot, you'll find yourself face to face with a large engine, gears, and machinery suitable for a post-apocalyptic era in this five-reel, four-row, and 40 payline game.\n\nUsing cartoon-style graphics, this game takes you to the heart of steampunk existence as you face a massive engine that makes up the reels. With each spin, you'll see this engine come to life with gears turning, and steam adding to the rustic atmosphere of this game.\n\nSteampunk graphics\nAll symbols are inspired by classic slots with a steampunk twist: the playing card suits, with the Diesel King, Steam Queen, and Punk Jack as the protagonists of this steampunk adventure.\n\nThe lower-paying symbols take the form of hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds, all created using scrap metal pieces, motors, and gears to give them an industrial makeover.\n\nAs the main characters are also symbolic of playing cards, they appear both upside down and upright and are stacked to show their full power when they fill a reel. Clearly, care has been taken with the design of these symbols, as the personality of the three main characters can be perceived through the images.\n\nAlthough not a paying symbol in itself, Hot Wild is extremely profitable because it also appears stacked and positions itself to fill any reel it lands on completely. Appropriately, the Hot Wild character is a female mechanic-the perfect image for a symbol that \"fixes\" paylines to pay more.\n\nThe wild can replace any symbol that is not the scatter to create the potential for huge wins. The Hot Scatter in this game is illustrated on a beloved yellow warning sign with the words \"Hot Scatter\". This is the only symbol that does not appear stacked and will appear randomly on one of the three central reels. Finding three scatters unlocks free spins in Hot Nudge.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nTo win at Hot Nudge, simply find three or more matching symbols along any of the generous 40 fixed paylines starting from the far-left reel. The Hot Wild symbol can replace any symbol other than the scatter to extend your matching rows and will appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, jostling to fill entire reels, adding a multiplier for each position it moves. Find a part of a Hot Wild on all three possible rows to get a massive x10 multiplier for each win.\n\nKeep an eye on one of the character symbols to fill all four rows in reels 1 and 2 to see their corresponding symbols push to fill all four rows on any other reel they land on.\n\nThe lower paying card symbols will pay out between 2x and 5x their stake when five of a kind are matched along a payline. Although this doesn't seem like a big win, considering the stacked nature of the symbols in Hot Nudge and the available 40 paylines, this can quickly add up when you're able to find matching symbols on multiple paylines, particularly when Hot Wild multipliers come into play.\n\nThe maximum win in the base game is 200x your stake when the Diesel King graces all five reels with his presence. If you can match the King with some Hot Wild multipliers, this 200x could increase to 400x or even 2,000x your bet, making for some incredibly profitable real money rewards to be won.\n\nAs the name 'Hot Nudge' suggests, the main bonus feature of this grungy game is the nudges offered to Hot Wilds and the steampunk Diesel, Queen, and Jack symbols, causing these symbols to take over entire reels when the situation is right.\n\nFor Hot Wilds, this symbol featuring a female mechanic in hot pants and a hood pushes up or down if even only a part of it shows on a reel to fill the available space. With each nudge, you'll get an additional multiplier to your winnings with the maximum available at x10. You can keep track of your multipliers in the top right corner of the engine reel. Multipliers last only for the spin on which they are generated, so you'll have to start from scratch for the next spin.\n\nIf any of the character symbols-the Diesel King, Steam Queen, or Punk Jack-fills all four rows of the first two reels, their corresponding appearance will also push to fill the set of reels on which they appear.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like Hot Nudge, you'll love Cazino Zeppelin. There isn't much more steampunk than a Zeppelin, and this Yggdrasil Gaming slot offers a great adventure experience with Victorian inventors, transferring and sticky wilds, and a generous bonus feature.\n            ",
