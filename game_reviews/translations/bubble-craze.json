Se l’hai fatto, allora sarai felice di sapere che questo gioco di slot online di IGT ha una portata simile. A differenza della tipica slot machine, per vincere le slot Bubble Craze il giocatore deve allineare i simboli in formazione di quattro o più con lo stesso colore. Continuate a leggere per saperne di più!\nUna grafica piena di bolle\nL’azione si svolge su una griglia esagonale che contiene spazi per diciannove bolle. Ad ogni rotazione, si vedranno le bolle galleggiare verso l’alto in posizione dal fondo dello schermo. Se non formano una combinazione vincente, scoppieranno e nuove bolle riempiranno i loro posti. Lo sfondo è anche un’immagine sfocata delle bolle.\nI simboli del gioco includono bolle di diversi colori, tra cui il rosso, il blu, il verde, l’arancione, il giallo, il viola e il marrone, creando un display colorato. Altri simboli includono la bolla di trasformazione e la bolla moltiplicatrice.\nNel pool di centinaia di giochi di slot standard, le slot Bubble Craze si presentano come qualcosa di veramente unico ed emozionante. Se siete uno di quei giocatori che si divertono a giocare alle slot, ma che vogliono anche provare un’esperienza di gioco diversa – Bubble Craze è la scelta perfetta per voi. Questo gioco ha una grafica eccellente, è alimentato da un fornitore leader nel settore e offre buoni payout.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nIn questa slot Bubble Craze ci sono otto bolle di colore diverso che offrono premi di valore diverso a seconda di quanti ne atterri sul mulinello. Ovviamente, maggiore è il numero di bolle dello stesso colore che atterrate in un cluster, maggiore è il valore del vostro payout per quel colore.\nIl valore delle bolle inizia con le bolle marroni e viola che pagano meno, che valgono 1000 monete per una griglia completa (19 bolle) e solo 10 monete per cinque. Poi ci sono le bolle verdi e blu che offrono entrambi payout leggermente più alti di 1.500 monete per 19 e 15 per quattro.\nLe bolle gialle e arancioni offrono il terzo livello di payout nel gioco e se si riesce a riempire l’intera griglia con lo stesso colore, si ottengono 2.000 monete, ma 25 per soli quattro abbinamenti. Le bolle rosse offrono il secondo livello di payout più alto di 5.000 monete per 19 e quelle d’argento il più grande con una vincita massima disponibile di 10.000 monete se si trasformano tutte e 19 le bolle d’argento.\nAlcune bolle contengono un moltiplicatore di 2x o 5x e se si ottiene una vincita con tale simbolo, tale vincita sarà moltiplicata per tale importo. Solo un moltiplicatore può essere attivo per ogni vincita – per fortuna, è il più alto.\nLe bolle possono anche avere la forma di un colorato disegno simile ad un atomo; l’atterraggio di tre o più di questi fa scattare la funzione bonus di giri gratuiti e ti vengono assegnati cinque giri gratuiti. Ogni testacoda è un vincitore e più bolle Transform e Multiplier saranno aggiunte al set di bobine. Questo turno bonus non può essere innescato nuovamente.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nNon c’è molto da dire, le bolle sono effettivamente rilassanti e molto belle da guardare. Se anche tu hai una passione per questi elementi quasi eterei, ti consigliamo Bubble Bubble, la Slot Machine prodotta da Real Time Gaming che offre 50 paylines e un sacco di bonus interessanti.\n",

We have one word for you: Bubbles! If you've played Bubble Witch or Candy Crush, you'll be thrilled to know that IGT's online slot game has a similar vibe. Unlike typical slot machines, to win in Bubble Craze, players must align symbols in formations of four or more with the same color. Keep reading to learn more!\n\nA Display of Bubbles\nThe action takes place on a hexagonal grid that contains spaces for nineteen bubbles. Every rotation, bubbles will float up into position from the bottom of the screen. If they do not form a winning combination, they will burst, and new bubbles will take their places. The background is also a blurred image of bubbles.\n\nGame symbols include bubbles of different colors, including red, blue, green, orange, yellow, purple, and brown, creating a colorful display. Other symbols include the transformation bubble and the multiplier bubble.\n\nAmong hundreds of standard slot games, Bubble Craze presents itself as truly unique and exciting. If you're one of those players who enjoys playing slots but wants to try a different gaming experience, Bubble Craze is the perfect choice for you. This game has excellent graphics, is powered by a leading provider in the industry, and offers good payouts.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nIn this Bubble Craze slot, there are eight bubbles of different colors that offer different value rewards depending on how many land on the reels. Of course, the more bubbles of the same color that land in a cluster, the higher the value of your payout for that color.\n\nThe value of the bubbles starts with brown and purple bubbles, which pay the least, at 1,000 coins for a full grid (19 bubbles) and only 10 coins for five. Then there are green and blue bubbles, both of which offer slightly higher payouts of 1,500 coins for 19 and 15 for four.\n\nYellow and orange bubbles offer the third level of payouts in the game, and if you manage to fill the entire grid with the same color, you'll receive 2,000 coins, but only 25 for just four matches. Red bubbles offer the second-highest payout level of 5,000 coins for 19, and silver bubbles have the highest with a maximum available win of 10,000 coins if all 19 silver bubbles are transformed.\n\nSome bubbles contain a 2x or 5x multiplier, and if you win with such a symbol, your winnings will be multiplied by that amount. Only one multiplier can be active for each win - luckily, it is the highest.\n\nBubbles can also take the form of a colorful atom-like design; landing three or more of these triggers the free spins bonus feature, and you are awarded five free spins. Every spin is a winner, and more Transform and Multiplier bubbles are added to the reel set. This bonus round cannot be triggered again.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nThere's not much to say: Bubbles are actually relaxing and beautiful to look at. If you too have a passion for these almost ethereal elements, we recommend Bubble Bubble, the slot machine produced by Real Time Gaming that offers 50 paylines and lots of interesting bonuses.\n            ",

The game takes place on a hexagonal grid, and bubbles float up into position from the bottom of the screen. The bubbles burst if they do not form a winning combination, and new bubbles take their places. If you're looking for a unique gaming experience, Bubble Craze might be a good choice for you.\n\nSymbols and payouts\n\nThe symbols in Bubble Craze are bubbles of different colors and include red, blue, green, orange, yellow, purple, and brown. The standard slot machine symbols are also present, and some bubbles contain a 2x or 5x multiplier. Payouts range from 1,000 coins for a full grid (19 bubbles) of brown and purple bubbles to a maximum available win of 10,000 coins if all 19 silver bubbles are transformed. The free spins bonus feature is triggered by landing three or more atom-like bubbles, and you are awarded five free spins.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nBubble Craze has excellent graphics that are sure to catch anyone's eye. The game's theme is bubbles, and the hexagonal grid with its bright and colorful bubbles is appealing. The background is a blurred image of bubbles, which subtly relates to the theme and makes it even more immersive.\n\nBonus features\n\nThe game's bonus feature is triggered by landing three or more atom-like bubbles, and you are awarded five free spins. Every spin is a winner, and more Transform and Multiplier bubbles are added to the reel set. This bonus round cannot be triggered again. The multiplier bubbles can multiply your winnings by 2x or 5x, and only one can be active for each win - luckily, it is the highest.\n\nDeveloper and provider information\n\nBubble Craze is developed by IGT, a leading provider in the online gaming industry. IGT has a proven track record of producing quality games, and Bubble Craze is no exception. If you're looking for a game that stands out and gives you a fresh experience, this game might be a good choice for you.\n\n        \n            ",

We have one word for you: Bubbles! If you've played Bubble Witch or Candy Crush, you'll be thrilled to know that IGT's online slot game has a similar vibe. Unlike typical slot machines, to win in Bubble Craze, players must align symbols in formations of four or more with the same color. Keep reading to learn more!\n\nA Display of Bubbles\nThe action takes place on a hexagonal grid that contains spaces for nineteen bubbles. Every rotation, bubbles will float up into position from the bottom of the screen. If they do not form a winning combination, they will burst, and new bubbles will take their places. The background is also a blurred image of bubbles.\n\nGame symbols include bubbles of different colors, including red, blue, green, orange, yellow, purple, and brown, creating a colorful display. Other symbols include the transformation bubble and the multiplier bubble.\n\nAmong hundreds of standard slot games, Bubble Craze presents itself as truly unique and exciting. If you're one of those players who enjoys playing slots but wants to try a different gaming experience, Bubble Craze is the perfect choice for you. This game has excellent graphics, is powered by a leading provider in the industry, and offers good payouts.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nIn this Bubble Craze slot, there are eight bubbles of different colors that offer different value rewards depending on how many land on the reels. Of course, the more bubbles of the same color that land in a cluster, the higher the value of your payout for that color.\n\nThe value of the bubbles starts with brown and purple bubbles, which pay the least, at 1,000 coins for a full grid (19 bubbles) and only 10 coins for five. Then there are green and blue bubbles, both of which offer slightly higher payouts of 1,500 coins for 19 and 15 for four.\n\nYellow and orange bubbles offer the third level of payouts in the game, and if you manage to fill the entire grid with the same color, you'll receive 2,000 coins, but only 25 for just four matches. Red bubbles offer the second-highest payout level of 5,000 coins for 19, and silver bubbles have the highest with a maximum available win of 10,000 coins if all 19 silver bubbles are transformed.\n\nSome bubbles contain a 2x or 5x multiplier, and if you win with such a symbol, your winnings will be multiplied by that amount. Only one multiplier can be active for each win - luckily, it is the highest.\n\nBubbles can also take the form of a colorful atom-like design; landing three or more of these triggers the free spins bonus feature, and you are awarded five free spins. Every spin is a winner, and more Transform and Multiplier bubbles are added to the reel set. This bonus round cannot be triggered again.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nThere's not much to say: Bubbles are actually relaxing and beautiful to look at. If you too have a passion for these almost ethereal elements, we recommend Bubble Bubble, the slot machine produced by Real Time Gaming that offers 50 paylines and lots of interesting bonuses.\n            ",

Of course, the more bubbles of the same color that land in a cluster, the higher the value of your payout for that color.\n\nThe value of the bubbles starts with brown and purple bubbles, which pay the least, at 1,000 coins for a full grid (19 bubbles) and only 10 coins for five. Then there are green and blue bubbles, both of which offer slightly higher payouts of 1,500 coins for 19 and 15 for four.\n\nYellow and orange bubbles offer the third level of payouts in the game, and if you manage to fill the entire grid with the same color, you'll receive 2,000 coins, but only 25 for just four matches. Red bubbles offer the second-highest payout level of 5,000 coins for 19, and silver bubbles have the highest with a maximum available win of 10,000 coins if all 19 silver bubbles are transformed.\n\nSome bubbles contain a 2x or 5x multiplier, and if you win with such a symbol, your winnings will be multiplied by that amount. Only one multiplier can be active for each win - luckily, it is the highest.\n\nBubbles can also take the form of a colorful atom-like design; landing three or more of these triggers the free spins bonus feature, and you are awarded five free spins. Every spin is a winner, and more Transform and Multiplier bubbles are added to the reel set. This bonus round cannot be triggered again.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nThere's not much to say: Bubbles are actually relaxing and beautiful to look at. If you too have a passion for these almost ethereal elements, we recommend Bubble Bubble, the slot machine produced by Real Time Gaming that offers 50 paylines and lots of interesting bonuses.\n            ",
