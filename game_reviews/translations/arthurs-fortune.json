This feature is kind of like magic – it randomly converts any symbols into other symbols – which, as you can imagine, could lead to MASSIVE payouts. Talk about a spellbinding experience!</p>\n\n  <p>Next up is the Free Spins feature. Who doesn’t love free stuff, amirite? Well, in this case, you could win up to a whopping 14 free spins! That’s twice as many as there are members of King Arthur’s legendary Round Table (or, at least as far as we can remember).</p>\n\n  <p>Finally, there’s the Bonus feature. This one can reward you with cash prizes, free spins or extra free spins up to 3 symbols for wild conversions.
