To find out the value of each symbol in various combos, we recommend consulting the Paytable. During the game, the Boom symbol may appear, which explodes and becomes a paying symbol.\nCaptain Wild is our Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is Loki, and when three of them land during a single spin, they reward with free spins, starting an epic battle. In fact, we will see the villain of the hour launching a bomb on the reels, which will turn green. If a Wild symbol appears, our hero will intervene to decontaminate the radioactive reel and increase the multiplier to apply to all winnings. With the Super Wild symbol, all the reels will be decontaminated and the multiplier increased by as many units as there are decontaminated reels.\nNext to the playing grid, there is a bar that increases after every non-winning spin.

It's no wonder that the game's style is comic book-inspired, with symbols that refer to the Marvel and DC universes. We find ourselves in New York, as indicated by the iconic Empire State Building symbol, and the city is threatened by the bad guy of the hour who will have to face off against Captain Wild, our hero.\nThe graphics are perfectly executed, the gameplay mechanics are very smooth, and the background music has a cinematic touch that increases the suspense, creating the atmosphere of the best superhero movies.\nFeatures of Captain Wild\nRed Rake has chosen to use a traditional grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows. We have 20 fixed paylines, on which you can bet from a minimum of 0.10 coins to a maximum of 15. The maximum payout is great, at 5,763 times the bet.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nCaptain Wild slot game\nGameplay mechanics\nSymbols and payouts\nBonuses and free spins\nBar and multiplier\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Captain Wild\nProtecting New York from the forces of evil is as simple as calling Captain Wild, the protagonist of the new slot game by Red Rake, filled with bonuses and surprises!\nWhat to Expect from Captain Wild\nAs soon as you launch Captain Wild, you will immediately notice a resemblance to some famous comic book characters, such as Captain America and Loki. It's no wonder that the game's style is comic book-inspired, with symbols that refer to the Marvel and DC universes. We find ourselves in New York, as indicated by the iconic Empire State Building symbol, and the city is threatened by the bad guy of the hour who will have to face off against Captain Wild, our hero.\nThe graphics are perfectly executed, the gameplay mechanics are very smooth, and the background music has a cinematic touch that increases the suspense, creating the atmosphere of the best superhero movies.\nFeatures of Captain Wild\nRed Rake has chosen to use a traditional grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows. We have 20 fixed paylines, on which you can bet from a minimum of 0.10 coins to a maximum of 15. The maximum payout is great, at 5,763 times the bet. You win every time you create a combo of at least three adjacent identical symbols that go from the left to the right reel.\nIt is possible to obtain two or more winning combinations on the same line, in which case only the higher winning combo will be paid out. If the combinations occur on different lines, the winnings will be added together.\nThe volatility is medium, the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95%.\nSymbols and Gameplay of Captain Wild\nAlso in Captain Wild, like in many other slot games, we find playing cards among the symbols that pay less. To obtain more rewarding wins, we must rely on the newspaper page, the laser gun, the fist, the radioactive bomb, the ring, and the burning skyscraper. To find out the value of each symbol in various combos, we recommend consulting the Paytable. During the game, the Boom symbol may appear, which explodes and becomes a paying symbol.\nCaptain Wild is our Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is Loki, and when three of them land during a single spin, they reward with free spins, starting an epic battle. In fact, we will see the villain of the hour launching a bomb on the reels, which will turn green. If a Wild symbol appears, our hero will intervene to decontaminate the radioactive reel and increase the multiplier to apply to all winnings. With the Super Wild symbol, all the reels will be decontaminated and the multiplier increased by as many units as there are decontaminated reels.\nNext to the playing grid, there is a bar that increases after every non-winning spin. When it is full, we will be offered the opportunity to spin the wheel and activate a multiplier of up to 100 times the bet value.\n\nFAQs \nWhat is the maximum payout in this slot?\n\nWith a single spin, you can reach a monstrous amount of 5,763 times the bet.\n\nWhere can I find Captain Wild?\n\nYou can play Captain Wild at all legal online casinos.\n\nWhat is the volatility of Captain Wild?\n\nIn this slot, it is medium, so we will have a good balance between spins made and sums awarded by the game.\n            ",

Wins are rewarded for combinations of at least three adjacent identical symbols that go from left to right, on the same line. Only the highest winning combo on a line is paid out if there are two or more. Symbols include playing cards and higher-paying items like a newspaper page, laser gun, fist, radioactive bomb, ring, and burning skyscraper. The game features a Wild symbol, Captain Wild, that replaces all symbols except the Scatter, Loki. The Boom symbol may appear during gameplay and will explode to become a paying symbol. Landing three Scatters triggers the free spins feature where an epic battle against the villain of the hour takes place.\n\nSymbols and payouts\n\nThe symbols in Captain Wild range from lower-paying playing cards to higher-paying items like a newspaper page, laser gun, fist, radioactive bomb, ring, and burning skyscraper. The Wild symbol, Captain Wild, replaces all symbols except the Scatter, which is Loki. The Boom symbol may appear during gameplay and will explode to become a paying symbol. The maximum payout in Captain Wild is 5,763 times the bet. For more information on payout values, it is recommended to consult the Paytable.\n\nBonuses and free spins\n\nCaptain Wild features a free spins bonus that is triggered by landing three Scatters, Loki. During the bonus, the villain of the hour launches a bomb that turns one or more reels green. If a Wild symbol appears, Captain Wild intervenes to remove the contamination and increase the multiplier, which applies to all winnings. With a Super Wild symbol, all of the reels are decontaminated, and the multiplier increases by the number of reels decontaminated. Additionally, there is a bar next to the playing grid that increases with every non-winning spin. When full, you can spin the wheel to activate a multiplier of up to 100 times the bet value.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nCaptain Wild has a comic book-inspired design with excellent graphics and smooth gameplay mechanics. The background music adds to the cinematic atmosphere, creating a sense of anticipation and suspense. The game is set in New York, and iconic symbols like the Empire State Building help to create an immersive experience for players.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nThe volatility in Captain Wild is medium, meaning a balance is struck between spins made and sums awarded by the game. The RTP (theoretical return to player) is 95%, which is typical for an online slot game. Players can bet from a minimum of 0.10 coins to a maximum of 15 per spin.\n\n        \n            ",

It's no wonder that the game's style is comic book-inspired, with symbols that refer to the Marvel and DC universes. We find ourselves in New York, as indicated by the iconic Empire State Building symbol, and the city is threatened by the bad guy of the hour who will have to face off against Captain Wild, our hero.\nThe graphics are perfectly executed, the gameplay mechanics are very smooth, and the background music has a cinematic touch that increases the suspense, creating the atmosphere of the best superhero movies.\nFeatures of Captain Wild\nRed Rake has chosen to use a traditional grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows. We have 20 fixed paylines, on which you can bet from a minimum of 0.10 coins to a maximum of 15. The maximum payout is great, at 5,763 times the bet. You win every time you create a combo of at least three adjacent identical symbols that go from the left to the right reel.\nIt is possible to obtain two or more winning combinations on the same line, in which case only the higher winning combo will be paid out. If the combinations occur on different lines, the winnings will be added together.\nThe volatility is medium, the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95%.\nSymbols and Gameplay of Captain Wild\nAlso in Captain Wild, like in many other slot games, we find playing cards among the symbols that pay less. To obtain more rewarding wins, we must rely on the newspaper page, the laser gun, the fist, the radioactive bomb, the ring, and the burning skyscraper. To find out the value of each symbol in various combos, we recommend consulting the Paytable. During the game, the Boom symbol may appear, which explodes and becomes a paying symbol.\nCaptain Wild is our Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is Loki, and when three of them land during a single spin, they reward with free spins, starting an epic battle. In fact, we will see the villain of the hour launching a bomb on the reels, which will turn green. If a Wild symbol appears, our hero will intervene to decontaminate the radioactive reel and increase the multiplier to apply to all winnings. With the Super Wild symbol, all the reels will be decontaminated and the multiplier increased by as many units as there are decontaminated reels.\nNext to the playing grid, there is a bar that increases after every non-winning spin. When it is full, we will be offered the opportunity to spin the wheel and activate a multiplier of up to 100 times the bet value.\n\nFAQs \nWhat is the maximum payout in this slot?\n\nWith a single spin, you can reach a monstrous amount of 5,763 times the bet.\n\nWhere can I find Captain Wild?\n\nYou can play Captain Wild at all legal online casinos.\n\nWhat is the volatility of Captain Wild?\n\nIn this slot, it is medium, so we will have a good balance between spins made and sums awarded by the game.\n            ",
