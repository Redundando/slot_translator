Based on the world-renowned artist, it uses the Tumbling Reels feature found in some IGT slots, allowing for consecutive wins on each spin. There is a Bonus Free Games feature where you can get up to 4 free spins, but the Connected Lines and Cascading Reels features can really increase your winnings.\n\nArtistic Graphics\nTake a journey back to Renaissance Italy in Michelangelo, a 5-reel, 99-payline video slot game by High5 Games. Based on the works of one of the greatest artists in the world, it features Tumbling Reels, wilds and a free spins feature. Play from €0.99 to €198 per spin.\n\nThe reels in Michelangelo include a trio of the artist's most famous sculptures, including an interpretation of David which is the largest standard paying symbol. Find 5 Davids and a jackpot of 1,000 coins will be yours. In addition to the sculptures and standard playing card symbols, there is also the M symbol, which pays out 5,000 times your bet line when you hit a combination of five symbols.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who likes a bit of culture with your online slots, then maybe we have just the thing for you; Michelangelo is a game dedicated to the great sculptor, painter, architect, and one of the greatest artists of the XV century. This IGT slot features Tumbling Reels and free spins, so play now or read on for more information.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nMichelangelo benefits from Tumbling Reels, which is found in IGT's Da Vinci Diamonds. After each successful spin, winning symbols will be removed and replaced with symbols directly above them. Another calculation is made. The Tumbling Reels continue as long as there is a winning combination on the reels. There is no limit to the number of reel spins. If you roll here, credits can soon be accumulated.\n\nFind 3 Free Games symbols on reels 1, 2, and 3 and you will activate the Bonus Free Games feature and be awarded 1-4 free spins. If more than 1 active payline triggers free spins, the total will be added together, so it is more than possible to hit more than 4 free games.\n\nThe free games have not 1 but 2 wild symbols. The red one appears on reels 1, 2 and 3, and the pink one on reels 2, 3 and 4. The tumbling reels are also played in the free spins.\n\nConsidering the starting material, the images on display in Michelangelo are a bit underwhelming. They are perfectly acceptable, but lack the wow factor. The features, however, are good - combining free spins, double wilds, and cascading reels, and wins can be very swift.\n\nMichelangelo is a five-reel slot with three rows and up to ninety-nine paylines; the IGT design is typically basic but everything is clear and there is a preponderance of gold borders on just about everything.\n\nThere are four high-value symbols including a large green ‘M’ and three sculptures - David, Moses, and the Venus de Milo; Q, K, and A make up the lower values. The wild symbol is a purple ‘Wild’ on a golden background, while the bonus is a ‘Free Games’ icon that appears only on reels one, two, and three.\n\nAlways one of our favourite features, Tumbling Reels is also known as Cascading Reels in other games. Whenever you get a winning combination, the involved symbols disappear and the spaces created are filled with other symbols that fall from above. If then another combination is made, the same thing happens again and this sequence continues until no more wins are formed.\n\nThis is triggered by landing three of the bonus Free Games symbols on reels one, two, and three on an active payline. You will receive one to four spins, but if your triggering symbols occur on more than one payline, you will receive more spins. During this spin, the original wild appears on reels two, three, and four, but there is also a new wild (on a red background) that appears on reels one, two, and three.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you loved this artistic-themed Slot Machine, we can suggest something very similar. IGT and High5 Games have produced some slots together such as Cats and Da Vinci Diamonds. These are the alternatives we propose if you want to continue betting on slots similar to Michelangelo.",

This IGT slot features Tumbling Reels and free spins, so play now or read the review below for more information.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nMichelangelo benefits from Tumbling Reels that can be found in IGT's Da Vinci Diamonds. After every successful spin, winning symbols will be cleared and replaced by the symbols directly above them. Another calculation will be made. The Tumbling Reels continue as long as there is a winning combination on the reels. There is no limit to the number of reel spins. If you roll here, credits can soon be accumulated.\n\nFind 3 Free Games symbols on reels 1, 2, and 3, and you'll trigger the Free Games Bonus feature and be rewarded with 1-4 free spins. If more than 1 active payline triggers free spins, the total will be tallied together, so it's more than possible to hit more than 4 free games.\n\nThe free games have not 1 but 2 wild symbols. Red appears on reels 1, 2, and 3, and pink on reels 2, 3, and 4. The tumbling reels are also played in free spins.\n\nConsidering the source material, the images shown in Michelangelo are a bit subpar. They're perfectly acceptable, but they lack the wow factor. The features are good, though – combining free spins, double wilds, and tumbling reels, and wins can be very fast.\n\nMichelangelo is a five-reel slot with three rows and up to ninety-nine pay lines; the IGT design is typically basic but everything is clear and there is a preponderance of gold edges on virtually everything.\n\nThere are four high-value symbols including a big green 'M' and three sculptures - David, Moses, and Venus de Milo; Q, K, and A make up the lower values. The wild symbol is a violet 'Wild' on a golden background, while the bonus is a 'Free Games' icon that only appears on reels one, two, and three.\n\nAlways one of our favorite features, Tumbling Reels is also known as Cascading Reels in other games. Every time you get a winning combination, the symbols involved disappear and the spaces created are filled with other symbols that fall from above. If you then make another combination, the same thing happens again and this sequence continues until no more wins are formed.\n\nThis is triggered by landing three of the Free Games bonus symbols on reels one, two, and three on an active payline. You'll receive one to four spins, but if your activation symbols occur on more than one pay line, you'll get more spins. During this spin, the original wild appears on reels two, three, and four, but there is also a new wild (on a red background) that appears on reels one, two, and three.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you loved this art-themed slot machine, we can suggest something very similar. IGT and High5 Games have produced some slots together like Cats and Da Vinci Diamonds. These are the alternatives we propose if you want to continue betting on slots similar to Michelangelo."

Whenever you get a winning combination, the involved symbols disappear and the spaces created are filled with other symbols that fall from above. If then another combination is made, the same thing happens again and this sequence continues until no more wins are formed.\n\nThis is triggered by landing three of the bonus Free Games symbols on reels one, two, and three on an active payline.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nMichelangelo slot game overview\nGame features: Tumbling Reels, wilds, Bonus Free Games\nPaylines and symbols\nHighest paying symbol\nBonus Free Games feature\nSwift wins through Tumbling Reels\nOther similar slots by High5 Games and IGT\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Michelangelo\nMichelangelo, powered by High5 Games, is a 5-reel, 99-payline slot game. Based on the world-renowned artist, it uses the Tumbling Reels feature found in some IGT slots, allowing for consecutive wins on each spin. There is a Bonus Free Games feature where you can get up to 4 free spins, but the Connected Lines and Cascading Reels features can really increase your winnings.\n\nArtistic Graphics\nTake a journey back to Renaissance Italy in Michelangelo, a 5-reel, 99-payline video slot game by High5 Games. Based on the works of one of the greatest artists in the world, it features Tumbling Reels, wilds and a free spins feature. Play from €0.99 to €198 per spin.\n\nThe reels in Michelangelo include a trio of the artist's most famous sculptures, including an interpretation of David which is the largest standard paying symbol. Find 5 Davids and a jackpot of 1,000 coins will be yours. In addition to the sculptures and standard playing card symbols, there is also the M symbol, which pays out 5,000 times your bet line when you hit a combination of five symbols.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who likes a bit of culture with your online slots, then maybe we have just the thing for you; Michelangelo is a game dedicated to the great sculptor, painter, architect, and one of the greatest artists of the XV century. This IGT slot features Tumbling Reels and free spins, so play now or read on for more information.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nMichelangelo benefits from Tumbling Reels, which is found in IGT's Da Vinci Diamonds. After each successful spin, winning symbols will be removed and replaced with symbols directly above them. Another calculation is made. The Tumbling Reels continue as long as there is a winning combination on the reels. There is no limit to the number of reel spins. If you roll here, credits can soon be accumulated.\n\nFind 3 Free Games symbols on reels 1, 2, and 3 and you will activate the Bonus Free Games feature and be awarded 1-4 free spins. If more than 1 active payline triggers free spins, the total will be added together, so it is more than possible to hit more than 4 free games.\n\nThe free games have not 1 but 2 wild symbols. The red one appears on reels 1, 2 and 3, and the pink one on reels 2, 3 and 4. The tumbling reels are also played in the free spins.\n\nConsidering the starting material, the images on display in Michelangelo are a bit underwhelming. They are perfectly acceptable, but lack the wow factor. The features, however, are good - combining free spins, double wilds, and cascading reels, and wins can be very swift.\n\nMichelangelo is a five-reel slot with three rows and up to ninety-nine paylines; the IGT design is typically basic but everything is clear and there is a preponderance of gold borders on just about everything.\n\nThere are four high-value symbols including a large green ‘M’ and three sculptures - David, Moses, and the Venus de Milo; Q, K, and A make up the lower values. The wild symbol is a purple ‘Wild’ on a golden background, while the bonus is a ‘Free Games’ icon that appears only on reels one, two, and three.\n\nAlways one of our favourite features, Tumbling Reels is also known as Cascading Reels in other games. Whenever you get a winning combination, the involved symbols disappear and the spaces created are filled with other symbols that fall from above. If then another combination is made, the same thing happens again and this sequence continues until no more wins are formed.\n\nThis is triggered by landing three of the bonus Free Games symbols on reels one, two, and three on an active payline. You will receive one to four spins, but if your triggering symbols occur on more than one payline, you will receive more spins. During this spin, the original wild appears on reels two, three, and four, but there is also a new wild (on a red background) that appears on reels one, two, and three.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you loved this artistic-themed Slot Machine, we can suggest something very similar. IGT and High5 Games have produced some slots together such as Cats and Da Vinci Diamonds. These are the alternatives we propose if you want to continue betting on slots similar to Michelangelo.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame Features\n\nMichelangelo is a 5-reel, 99-payline slot game, which uses the Tumbling Reels feature found in some IGT slots, allowing for consecutive wins on each spin. There is a Bonus Free Games feature where you can get up to 4 free spins, but the Connected Lines and Cascading Reels features can really increase your winnings.\n\nPayouts and Symbols\n\nThe reels in Michelangelo include a trio of the artist's most famous sculptures, including an interpretation of David which is the largest standard paying symbol. There is also the M symbol, which pays out 5,000 times your bet line when you hit a combination of five symbols. In addition to the sculptures and standard playing card symbols, there are wild symbols, double wilds, and free games symbols.\n\nBonus Features\n\nMichelangelo benefits from Tumbling Reels, which is found in IGT's Da Vinci Diamonds. After each successful spin, winning symbols will be removed and replaced with symbols directly above them. The Tumbling Reels continue as long as there is a winning combination on the reels. Find 3 Free Games symbols on reels 1, 2, and 3 and you will activate the Bonus Free Games feature and be awarded 1-4 free spins. The free games have not 1 but 2 wild symbols. The tumbling reels are also played in the free spins.\n\nGame Design\n\nThe design of Michelangelo is based on the works of the Renaissance artist. The graphics are artful and evoke the style of the period. However, the images on display in Michelangelo are a bit underwhelming. They are perfectly acceptable, but lack the wow factor.\n\nSimilar Slots\n\nIGT and High5 Games have produced some slots together such as Cats and Da Vinci Diamonds, which are similar to Michelangelo.\n\nGame Provider\n\nMichelangelo is powered by High5 Games, which is known for its innovative and entertaining online slot games.\n\nNumber of Reels and Paylines\n\nMichelangelo is a 5-reel, 99-payline slot game, which offers many opportunities for players to win big.\n\n        \n            ",

Based on the works of one of the greatest artists in the world, it features Tumbling Reels, wilds and a free spins feature. Play from €0.99 to €198 per spin.\n\nThe reels in Michelangelo include a trio of the artist's most famous sculptures, including an interpretation of David which is the largest standard paying symbol. Find 5 Davids and a jackpot of 1,000 coins will be yours. In addition to the sculptures and standard playing card symbols, there is also the M symbol, which pays out 5,000 times your bet line when you hit a combination of five symbols.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who likes a bit of culture with your online slots, then maybe we have just the thing for you; Michelangelo is a game dedicated to the great sculptor, painter, architect, and one of the greatest artists of the XV century. This IGT slot features Tumbling Reels and free spins, so play now or read on for more information.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nMichelangelo benefits from Tumbling Reels, which is found in IGT's Da Vinci Diamonds. After each successful spin, winning symbols will be removed and replaced with symbols directly above them. Another calculation is made. The Tumbling Reels continue as long as there is a winning combination on the reels. There is no limit to the number of reel spins. If you roll here, credits can soon be accumulated.\n\nFind 3 Free Games symbols on reels 1, 2, and 3 and you will activate the Bonus Free Games feature and be awarded 1-4 free spins. If more than 1 active payline triggers free spins, the total will be added together, so it is more than possible to hit more than 4 free games.\n\nThe free games have not 1 but 2 wild symbols. The red one appears on reels 1, 2 and 3, and the pink one on reels 2, 3 and 4. The tumbling reels are also played in the free spins.\n\nConsidering the starting material, the images on display in Michelangelo are a bit underwhelming. They are perfectly acceptable, but lack the wow factor. The features, however, are good - combining free spins, double wilds, and cascading reels, and wins can be very swift.\n\nMichelangelo is a five-reel slot with three rows and up to ninety-nine paylines; the IGT design is typically basic but everything is clear and there is a preponderance of gold borders on just about everything.\n\nThere are four high-value symbols including a large green ‘M’ and three sculptures - David, Moses, and the Venus de Milo; Q, K, and A make up the lower values. The wild symbol is a purple ‘Wild’ on a golden background, while the bonus is a ‘Free Games’ icon that appears only on reels one, two, and three.\n\nAlways one of our favourite features, Tumbling Reels is also known as Cascading Reels in other games. Whenever you get a winning combination, the involved symbols disappear and the spaces created are filled with other symbols that fall from above. If then another combination is made, the same thing happens again and this sequence continues until no more wins are formed.\n\nThis is triggered by landing three of the bonus Free Games symbols on reels one, two, and three on an active payline. You will receive one to four spins, but if your triggering symbols occur on more than one payline, you will receive more spins. During this spin, the original wild appears on reels two, three, and four, but there is also a new wild (on a red background) that appears on reels one, two, and three.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you loved this artistic-themed Slot Machine, we can suggest something very similar. IGT and High5 Games have produced some slots together such as Cats and Da Vinci Diamonds. These are the alternatives we propose if you want to continue betting on slots similar to Michelangelo.\n            ",

Based on the world-renowned artist, it uses the Tumbling Reels feature found in some IGT slots, allowing for consecutive wins on each spin. There is a Bonus Free Games feature where you can get up to 4 free spins, but the Connected Lines and Cascading Reels features can really increase your winnings.\n\nArtistic Graphics\nTake a journey back to Renaissance Italy in Michelangelo, a 5-reel, 99-payline video slot game by High5 Games. Based on the works of one of the greatest artists in the world, it features Tumbling Reels, wilds and a free spins feature. Play from €0.99 to €198 per spin.\n\nThe reels in Michelangelo include a trio of the artist's most famous sculptures, including an interpretation of David which is the largest standard paying symbol. Find 5 Davids and a jackpot of 1,000 coins will be yours. In addition to the sculptures and standard playing card symbols, there is also the M symbol, which pays out 5,000 times your bet line when you hit a combination of five symbols.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who likes a bit of culture with your online slots, then maybe we have just the thing for you; Michelangelo is a game dedicated to the great sculptor, painter, architect, and one of the greatest artists of the XV century. This IGT slot features Tumbling Reels and free spins, so play now or read on for more information.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nMichelangelo benefits from Tumbling Reels, which is found in IGT's Da Vinci Diamonds. After each successful spin, winning symbols will be removed and replaced with symbols directly above them. Another calculation is made. The Tumbling Reels continue as long as there is a winning combination on the reels. There is no limit to the number of reel spins. If you roll here, credits can soon be accumulated.\n\nFind 3 Free Games symbols on reels 1, 2, and 3 and you will activate the Bonus Free Games feature and be awarded 1-4 free spins. If more than 1 active payline triggers free spins, the total will be added together, so it is more than possible to hit more than 4 free games.\n\nThe free games have not 1 but 2 wild symbols. The red one appears on reels 1, 2 and 3, and the pink one on reels 2, 3 and 4. The tumbling reels are also played in the free spins.\n\nConsidering the starting material, the images on display in Michelangelo are a bit underwhelming. They are perfectly acceptable, but lack the wow factor. The features, however, are good - combining free spins, double wilds, and cascading reels, and wins can be very swift.\n\nMichelangelo is a five-reel slot with three rows and up to ninety-nine paylines; the IGT design is typically basic but everything is clear and there is a preponderance of gold borders on just about everything.\n\nThere are four high-value symbols including a large green ‘M’ and three sculptures - David, Moses, and the Venus de Milo; Q, K, and A make up the lower values. The wild symbol is a purple ‘Wild’ on a golden background, while the bonus is a ‘Free Games’ icon that appears only on reels one, two, and three.\n\nAlways one of our favourite features, Tumbling Reels is also known as Cascading Reels in other games. Whenever you get a winning combination, the involved symbols disappear and the spaces created are filled with other symbols that fall from above. If then another combination is made, the same thing happens again and this sequence continues until no more wins are formed.\n\nThis is triggered by landing three of the bonus Free Games symbols on reels one, two, and three on an active payline. You will receive one to four spins, but if your triggering symbols occur on more than one payline, you will receive more spins. During this spin, the original wild appears on reels two, three, and four, but there is also a new wild (on a red background) that appears on reels one, two, and three.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you loved this artistic-themed Slot Machine, we can suggest something very similar. IGT and High5 Games have produced some slots together such as Cats and Da Vinci Diamonds. These are the alternatives we propose if you want to continue betting on slots similar to Michelangelo.\n        ",
