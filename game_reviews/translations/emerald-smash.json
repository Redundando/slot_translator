Inspired has paid homage to tradition by creating a slot machine with fruits made of emerald, but trying to bring a wave of innovation by inserting additional symbols that, by breaking into a thousand pieces, ensure winnings of a certain level. Let's start with the graphics, which are very plain and without frills. Not necessarily a negative trait, in fact, from our point of view, we find that a fruit-themed slot machine is not created by developers to amaze with animations and special effects, but rather to offer a product with simple and intuitive gameplay. The game grid stands out on a background that fades from pink to purple, with few buttons appearing at the sides. In fact, during the game, the Start, Settings, and Bet Value buttons disappear and reappear once the reels stop. An electronica tune serves as background music for the game, with an overlying laser beam indicating a win.\nMain features of the slot machine\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 3 lines, with 30 fixed pay lines that cannot be modified. The minimum bet for a single spin is €0.30, or €0.03 per line, while the maximum is €90. In case of a win on multiple lines, only the highest one is paid. Winning combinations go from left to right. From the settings, it is possible to turn off the sound, activate the Left-hand mode that reverses the position of the buttons, and activate Turbo for an accelerated reel rotation. Holding down the Start button accesses the automatic spins page. From there, it is possible to set from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 100 spins, as well as set loss or win limits. Emerald Smash has a fairly good theoretical return to the player (RTP), equal to 96.5%.\nSymbols and functionalities of Emerald Smash\nTo have winning combinations, it is necessary to have at least 3 symbols on the reels, except for 7 for which 2 are enough. In order of value, the lowest symbols are the lemon, grape, and cherry, followed by the orange, strawberry, and watermelon. The clover and star have a good return, although the number 7 is worth the most. For a concrete example, if we decide to bet the minimum bet, €0.30, and see 5 symbols 7 appear, then we will be paid back €5.\nFrom time to time, green emeralds that break and release a random symbol can appear on the reels.

Inspired has paid homage to tradition by creating a slot machine with fruits made of emerald, but trying to bring a wave of innovation by inserting additional symbols that, by breaking into a thousand pieces, ensure winnings of a certain level. Let's start with the graphics, which are very plain and without frills. Not necessarily a negative trait, in fact, from our point of view, we find that a fruit-themed slot machine is not created by developers to amaze with animations and special effects, but rather to offer a product with simple and intuitive gameplay. The game grid stands out on a background that fades from pink to purple, with few buttons appearing at the sides. In fact, during the game, the Start, Settings, and Bet Value buttons disappear and reappear once the reels stop. An electronica tune serves as background music for the game, with an overlying laser beam indicating a win.\nMain features of the slot machine\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 3 lines, with 30 fixed pay lines that cannot be modified. The minimum bet for a single spin is €0.30, or €0.03 per line, while the maximum is €90. In case of a win on multiple lines, only the highest one is paid. Winning combinations go from left to right. From the settings, it is possible to turn off the sound, activate the Left-hand mode that reverses the position of the buttons, and activate Turbo for an accelerated reel rotation. Holding down the Start button accesses the automatic spins page. From there, it is possible to set from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 100 spins, as well as set loss or win limits. Emerald Smash has a fairly good theoretical return to the player (RTP), equal to 96.5%.\nSymbols and functionalities of Emerald Smash\nTo have winning combinations, it is necessary to have at least 3 symbols on the reels, except for 7 for which 2 are enough. In order of value, the lowest symbols are the lemon, grape, and cherry, followed by the orange, strawberry, and watermelon. The clover and star have a good return, although the number 7 is worth the most. For a concrete example, if we decide to bet the minimum bet, €0.30, and see 5 symbols 7 appear, then we will be paid back €5.\nFrom time to time, green emeralds that break and release a random symbol can appear on the reels. All the emeralds present will take on the appearance of that symbol, thus creating a winning combination or, if there are other symbols on the grid, increasing the win.\nWild and Scatter symbols are not present in Emerald Smash.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\nEmerald Smash is a 5-reel, 3-row slot machine with 30 fixed pay lines. The game has a minimum bet of €0.30 and a maximum bet of €90. Winning combinations go from left to right, paying out only the highest line. Players can turn off the sound, activate Turbo mode and switch to Left-hand mode for left-handed users. The game also offers automatic spins, ranging from 5 to 100 spins, with loss or win limits.\n\nRTP\n\nEmerald Smash has a theoretical return to the player (RTP) of 96.5%, which is more than acceptable for an online slot game.\n\nSymbols\n\nIn addition to traditional fruit symbols like lemons, grapes, cherries, oranges, and watermelons, Emerald Smash has high-paying symbols like a four-leaf clover, a star, and the number 7. To form winning combinations, players need to have at least three symbols on the reels, with two being enough for the number 7. The highest-paying symbol in the game is the number 7, with a potential payout of €5 for those betting the minimum of €0.30 and seeing five symbols land.\n\nInterface\n\nThe game grid of Emerald Smash is simple, with a plain purple-to-pink background and few buttons appearing at the sides. During gameplay, the Start, Settings, and Bet Value buttons disappear and reappear once the reels stop. The electronica tune serves as background music, while an overlying laser beam indicates a win.\n\nAutomatic spins\n\nPlayers can access the automatic spins page by holding down the Start button. From there, players can set a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 100 spins, as well as their loss or win limits. This feature is a convenient way for players to enjoy the game without having to manually spin the reels every time.\n\n        \n            ",

The game has a 5x3 reel format with 30 fixed pay lines that can't be modified. The game features auto spins, the ability to activate Turbo mode, and you can adjust loss or win limits from the automatic spins page. Emerald Smash doesn't have any bonus rounds or gamble features.\n\nSymbols and Pay Lines\n\nEmerald Smash has several symbols with varying values, including lemons, grapes, cherries, oranges, strawberry, watermelon, clovers, stars, and the number 7. The lowest symbols are the lemon, grape, and cherry, while the clover and star have a good return. The number 7 is the most valuable symbol in the game. To win the game, the player needs at least three matching symbols on the reels, except for 7 which requires only two. Winning combinations go from left to right.\n\nBet Range and Automatic Spins\n\nThe minimum bet for a single spin is €0.30 (€0.01 per line), while the maximum bet is €90. The game offers automatic spins, with players able to set from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 100 spins. From the automatic spins page, players can also set limits on losses or wins. The game also has Turbo mode for players who prefer faster reel rotation.\n\nTheoretical Return to Player (RTP)\n\nEmerald Smash has a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.5%, which is above average when compared to other slot games. This means the game pays out 96.5% of the total amount wagered by players over an extended period of time.\n\nOverall Game Experience\n\nEmerald Smash offers a classic fruit-themed slot experience with a touch of innovation with the addition of emerald symbols. The graphics are plain and without distractions, with the game grid set against a fading pink and purple background. The game features a simple electronica tune as its background music. The gameplay is straightforward, with auto spins, turbo mode, and win or loss limits available to players. The lack of bonus rounds or gamble features may deter some players, but the 96.5% RTP and the opportunity to win up to €5 from a €0.30 bet with five 7s makes this game worth playing.\n\n        \n            ",

Inspired has paid homage to tradition by creating a slot machine with fruits made of emerald, but trying to bring a wave of innovation by inserting additional symbols that, by breaking into a thousand pieces, ensure winnings of a certain level. Let's start with the graphics, which are very plain and without frills. Not necessarily a negative trait, in fact, from our point of view, we find that a fruit-themed slot machine is not created by developers to amaze with animations and special effects, but rather to offer a product with simple and intuitive gameplay. The game grid stands out on a background that fades from pink to purple, with few buttons appearing at the sides. In fact, during the game, the Start, Settings, and Bet Value buttons disappear and reappear once the reels stop. An electronica tune serves as background music for the game, with an overlying laser beam indicating a win.\nMain features of the slot machine\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 3 lines, with 30 fixed pay lines that cannot be modified. The minimum bet for a single spin is €0.30, or €0.03 per line, while the maximum is €90. In case of a win on multiple lines, only the highest one is paid. Winning combinations go from left to right. From the settings, it is possible to turn off the sound, activate the Left-hand mode that reverses the position of the buttons, and activate Turbo for an accelerated reel rotation. Holding down the Start button accesses the automatic spins page. From there, it is possible to set from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 100 spins, as well as set loss or win limits. Emerald Smash has a fairly good theoretical return to the player (RTP), equal to 96.5%.\nSymbols and functionalities of Emerald Smash\nTo have winning combinations, it is necessary to have at least 3 symbols on the reels, except for 7 for which 2 are enough. In order of value, the lowest symbols are the lemon, grape, and cherry, followed by the orange, strawberry, and watermelon. The clover and star have a good return, although the number 7 is worth the most. For a concrete example, if we decide to bet the minimum bet, €0.30, and see 5 symbols 7 appear, then we will be paid back €5.\nFrom time to time, green emeralds that break and release a random symbol can appear on the reels. All the emeralds present will take on the appearance of that symbol, thus creating a winning combination or, if there are other symbols on the grid, increasing the win.\nWild and Scatter symbols are not present in Emerald Smash.\n            ",

Inspired has paid homage to tradition by creating a slot machine with fruits made of emerald, but trying to bring a wave of innovation by inserting additional symbols that, by breaking into a thousand pieces, ensure winnings of a certain level. Let's start with the graphics, which are very plain and without frills. Not necessarily a negative trait, in fact, from our point of view, we find that a fruit-themed slot machine is not created by developers to amaze with animations and special effects, but rather to offer a product with simple and intuitive gameplay. The game grid stands out on a background that fades from pink to purple, with few buttons appearing at the sides. In fact, during the game, the Start, Settings, and Bet Value buttons disappear and reappear once the reels stop. An electronica tune serves as background music for the game, with an overlying laser beam indicating a win.\nMain features of the slot machine\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 3 lines, with 30 fixed pay lines that cannot be modified. The minimum bet for a single spin is €0.30, or €0.03 per line, while the maximum is €90. In case of a win on multiple lines, only the highest one is paid. Winning combinations go from left to right. From the settings, it is possible to turn off the sound, activate the Left-hand mode that reverses the position of the buttons, and activate Turbo for an accelerated reel rotation. Holding down the Start button accesses the automatic spins page. From there, it is possible to set from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 100 spins, as well as set loss or win limits. Emerald Smash has a fairly good theoretical return to the player (RTP), equal to 96.5%.\nSymbols and functionalities of Emerald Smash\nTo have winning combinations, it is necessary to have at least 3 symbols on the reels, except for 7 for which 2 are enough. In order of value, the lowest symbols are the lemon, grape, and cherry, followed by the orange, strawberry, and watermelon. The clover and star have a good return, although the number 7 is worth the most. For a concrete example, if we decide to bet the minimum bet, €0.30, and see 5 symbols 7 appear, then we will be paid back €5.\nFrom time to time, green emeralds that break and release a random symbol can appear on the reels. All the emeralds present will take on the appearance of that symbol, thus creating a winning combination or, if there are other symbols on the grid, increasing the win.\nWild and Scatter symbols are not present in Emerald Smash.\n        ",
