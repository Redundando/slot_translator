Even today, more than forty years after his passing, Elvis Presley is still a living legend, and his albums are still loved and played by fans all over the world.\n\nThe graphics of this slot machine are very pleasing, and the interface is engaging. All the symbols on the reels are a tribute to the king of rock, starting from his legendary blue suede shoes, followed by his guitar, a purple teddy bear, and a hunting dog. The background in which Elvis moves in this slot machine resembles a kind of Sin City, created with decent but engaging graphics.\n\nThe initial screen of the game opens with photos of Elvis Presley and, of course, his music in the background, which accompanies the player through every phase of the game, making it a highly exciting gaming experience, particularly for music lovers worldwide, and Elvis Presley aficionados.\n\nMain Features of the Slot\n\nWMS already has another slot game centered around Elvis Presley, called “Elvis Lives.” However, this new title differs from the previous one, especially in terms of gameplay, which is much more intricate and engaging. Elvis: The King Lives features 80 paylines and a distinct set of reels with two mini-grids, one with two reels and two rows, and the other with three reels and six rows. At first sight, this may seem complicated or confusing, but once you start playing, you'll realize that this slot isn't too difficult to master.\n\nFor instance, to get a winning combination, you need to have two similar and adjacent symbols on the first grid and another identical symbol or a wild card on the larger grid. You can bet from a minimum of 0.40 up to a maximum of 200 € on all 80 paylines on Elvis: The King Lives.\n\nSymbols and Special Features of Elvis: The King Lives\n\nBesides the above-mentioned thematic symbols, Elvis: The King Lives also has traditional playing cards, which, as always, have the lowest values. Concerning the symbols and special features, we have a Wild symbol represented by Elvis himself, which functions as a wild card. Along with this, there is also the Elvis Feature symbol that when it appears on the reels at least three times, it rewards you with a variable number of free spins, and if it occupies the entire grid, you can win a prize equal to 100 times your bet.\n\nFinally, we have the Bonus Jukebox, which activates at the start of the free spins and provides prizes up to 25 times your bet. As an experienced gambler, you'll enjoy the excitement of Elvis: The King Lives and can immerse yourself in the aura of the legendary King of Rock and Roll.",

The game is based on the legendary King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, and features impressively crafted graphics and engaging gameplay. There is also an Elvis Lives slot game by the same company, but ELVIS: THE KING Lives is unique and offers a more intricate and captivating gaming experience.\n\nGameplay and Rules\n\nWith 80 paylines and a unique set of reels with two mini-grids, ELVIS: THE KING Lives may look challenging to grasp at first glance. However, once you start playing, you'll realize that it's straightforward to understand its gameplay and rules. To get a winning combination, you need to have similar and adjacent symbols on the first grid and another identical symbol or a wild card on the larger grid. You can place your bets from a minimum of 0.40 up to a maximum of 200 € on all 80 paylines on Elvis: The King Lives.\n\nUnique Set of Reels with Two Mini-grids\n\nELVIS: THE KING Lives is distinctive and features a unique set of reels with two mini-grids, one with two reels and two rows, and the other with three reels and six rows. This setup offers a more engaging and complex gaming experience for players who enjoy the challenge of figuring out new ways to win.\n\nSymbols and Graphics Paying Tribute to Elvis Presley\n\nThe symbols in ELVIS: THE KING Lives are a tribute to the legendary Elvis Presley. These symbols include his famous blue suede shoes, guitar, purple teddy bear, and hunting dog, among others. The graphics and interface of the game are engaging, with a background that resembles Sin City, providing players with a complete gaming experience. Additionally, the game has traditional playing cards with lower value, alongside thematic symbols and graphics that pay homage to the King of Rock and Roll.\n\nBonus Features and Free Spins\n\nELVIS: THE KING Lives offers players several bonus features and free spins to enhance their gaming experience. Firstly, there is the Wild symbol represented by Elvis himself, which substitutes for all symbols except for the Elvis Feature and Bonus Jukebox symbols. Secondly, the Elvis Feature symbol can appear three or more times on the reels, and it rewards players with a variable number of free spins. Finally, the Bonus Jukebox activates at the start of the free spins and provides prizes up to 25 times your bet. If the Elvis Feature symbols occupy the entire grid, players can win big prizes of up to 100 times their bet.\n\n        \n            ",

Even today, more than forty years after his passing, Elvis Presley is still a living legend, and his albums are still loved and played by fans all over the world.\n\nThe graphics of this slot machine are very pleasing, and the interface is engaging. All the symbols on the reels are a tribute to the king of rock, starting from his legendary blue suede shoes, followed by his guitar, a purple teddy bear, and a hunting dog. The background in which Elvis moves in this slot machine resembles a kind of Sin City, created with decent but engaging graphics.\n\nThe initial screen of the game opens with photos of Elvis Presley and, of course, his music in the background, which accompanies the player through every phase of the game, making it a highly exciting gaming experience, particularly for music lovers worldwide, and Elvis Presley aficionados.\n\nMain Features of the Slot\n\nWMS already has another slot game centered around Elvis Presley, called “Elvis Lives.” However, this new title differs from the previous one, especially in terms of gameplay, which is much more intricate and engaging. Elvis: The King Lives features 80 paylines and a distinct set of reels with two mini-grids, one with two reels and two rows, and the other with three reels and six rows. At first sight, this may seem complicated or confusing, but once you start playing, you'll realize that this slot isn't too difficult to master.\n\nFor instance, to get a winning combination, you need to have two similar and adjacent symbols on the first grid and another identical symbol or a wild card on the larger grid. You can bet from a minimum of 0.40 up to a maximum of 200 € on all 80 paylines on Elvis: The King Lives.\n\nSymbols and Special Features of Elvis: The King Lives\n\nBesides the above-mentioned thematic symbols, Elvis: The King Lives also has traditional playing cards, which, as always, have the lowest values. Concerning the symbols and special features, we have a Wild symbol represented by Elvis himself, which functions as a wild card. Along with this, there is also the Elvis Feature symbol that when it appears on the reels at least three times, it rewards you with a variable number of free spins, and if it occupies the entire grid, you can win a prize equal to 100 times your bet.\n\nFinally, we have the Bonus Jukebox, which activates at the start of the free spins and provides prizes up to 25 times your bet. As an experienced gambler, you'll enjoy the excitement of Elvis: The King Lives and can immerse yourself in the aura of the legendary King of Rock and Roll.\n            ",

Even today, more than forty years after his passing, Elvis Presley is still a living legend, and his albums are still loved and played by fans all over the world.\n\nThe graphics of this slot machine are very pleasing, and the interface is engaging. All the symbols on the reels are a tribute to the king of rock, starting from his legendary blue suede shoes, followed by his guitar, a purple teddy bear, and a hunting dog. The background in which Elvis moves in this slot machine resembles a kind of Sin City, created with decent but engaging graphics.\n\nThe initial screen of the game opens with photos of Elvis Presley and, of course, his music in the background, which accompanies the player through every phase of the game, making it a highly exciting gaming experience, particularly for music lovers worldwide, and Elvis Presley aficionados.\n\nMain Features of the Slot\n\nWMS already has another slot game centered around Elvis Presley, called “Elvis Lives.” However, this new title differs from the previous one, especially in terms of gameplay, which is much more intricate and engaging. Elvis: The King Lives features 80 paylines and a distinct set of reels with two mini-grids, one with two reels and two rows, and the other with three reels and six rows. At first sight, this may seem complicated or confusing, but once you start playing, you'll realize that this slot isn't too difficult to master.\n\nFor instance, to get a winning combination, you need to have two similar and adjacent symbols on the first grid and another identical symbol or a wild card on the larger grid. You can bet from a minimum of 0.40 up to a maximum of 200 € on all 80 paylines on Elvis: The King Lives.\n\nSymbols and Special Features of Elvis: The King Lives\n\nBesides the above-mentioned thematic symbols, Elvis: The King Lives also has traditional playing cards, which, as always, have the lowest values. Concerning the symbols and special features, we have a Wild symbol represented by Elvis himself, which functions as a wild card. Along with this, there is also the Elvis Feature symbol that when it appears on the reels at least three times, it rewards you with a variable number of free spins, and if it occupies the entire grid, you can win a prize equal to 100 times your bet.\n\nFinally, we have the Bonus Jukebox, which activates at the start of the free spins and provides prizes up to 25 times your bet. As an experienced gambler, you'll enjoy the excitement of Elvis: The King Lives and can immerse yourself in the aura of the legendary King of Rock and Roll.\n            ",
