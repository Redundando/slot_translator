Il giocatore potrà affiancarsi a questa divinità e scoprire quali sono le giocate vincenti e fortunate di una macchinetta che permette tra le tante cose di vincere un alto numero di giri gratuiti. Il massimo offerto è di 100 free spin! Di seguito scopriremo quali sono le caratteristiche della slot, e soprattutto in che modo è possibile sfidare il suo tabellone per ottenere simboli vincenti che sbloccheranno montepremi da sogno!\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nSe si parla di divinità dove finisce subito la nostra mente? All’Antica Grecia, dove Dei e Olimpo si incontrano e prendono vita grazie a una grafica ben fatta. Troviamo uno sfondo di nuvole pronte a circondare la grande porta d’entrata al regno degli Dei. Ed è così che spunta il possente Kronos, che oltre a governare il tempo, si fa accompagnare da cavalli alati e oggetti magici. La slot machine nasce con una struttura molto classica formata da  5 rulli e 20 linee di pagamento. A ogni gamer è data la possibilità di attivare la funzione autoplay così da godersi lo spettacolo senza interagire con il gioco. I rulli potranno muoversi da soli e rispettare il limite di scommessa che è stato impostato manualmente. Considera che ogni puntata va da 0,01€ a un massimo di 3,00€. La macchinetta presenta una serie di simboli che sono fondamentali per il regolare svolgimento del game. Le icone che troviamo rappresentano lo stesso Kronos, l’antico tempio; il prestigioso Pegaso cavallo alato; l’anello incantato e il trono. A completare il parco giochi sono poi i simboli delle carte da gioco, ovvero i cuori, picche, quadri e fiori.\nImportante è il simbolo Wild, che è stato pensato con le sembianze di un leone d’oro, il cui potere è quello di sostituire tutti i simboli di gioco fatta eccezione per lo Scatter. Quest’ultimo è la lettera K con ali, che farà vincere fino a 100 giri gratis. E’ questo il solo bonus che si può trovare durante il gameplay: con 3 medaglioni d’oro si ottengono 10 giri free, con 4 si hanno 25 giri e con 5 si ottengono invece i 100 giri.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Kronos\nNonostante, a livello grafico, ci si aspetti qualcosa di più vista l’imponenza del grande Kronos e dell’atmosfera presentata, la slot machine online è abbastanza semplice e molto basilare. Si scommette con facilità interagendo con le sue 20 linee di pagamento e il gioco è fatto. Non resta che osservare l’andamento dei rulli, aspettare che vengano segnate e raccolte le vincite su Kronos e sperare nell’attivazione del bonus free spin. Se cerchi una slot con colpi di scena e grande adrenalina non è sicuramente la soluzione adatta a te, ma è ideale per chi vuole vincere senza dover interagire con un gioco troppo ricco di colpi scena o bonus extra. Non male il suo RTP (Return To Player) che si ferma alla percentuale di 95,94%, in linea con la media del settore.\n",

Join forces with this divine figure and discover the winning combinations on a slot machine that can reward you with an impressive number of free spins - up to 100! Let's take a closer look at the slot's features and learn how to unlock dream jackpots by mastering its gameboard!\n\nGraphics and symbols\nWhere does our mind wander when we think of gods? To ancient Greece, of course, where the gods and Mount Olympus come to life in impressive graphics. The background displays clouds enveloping the grand entrance to the gods' realm. And there stands the mighty Kronos, who, besides his time-wielding powers, is accompanied by winged horses and enchanted objects. The game follows a classic structure, with 5 reels and 20 paylines. Gaming is made easy by the autoplay function, letting you enjoy the show without having to worry about interactions. The reels spin automatically while limiting your bets to the manual settings, ranging from 0.01 € to 3.00 € per bet. The game features an array of symbols that are crucial to gameplay. Icons include representations of Kronos himself, the ancient temple, the prestigious winged horse Pegasus, the enchanted ring, and the throne. Completing the package are the card symbols - hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs.\n\nThe Wild symbol is crucial, taking on the form of a golden lion, able to replace any game symbol except the Scatter. The Scatter symbol is a letter K with wings, leading to up to 100 free spins. This bonus is the only one you will encounter during gameplay - 3 golden medallions are worth 10 free spins, 4 earn you 25 spins, and 5 score the grand prize of 100 spins.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nDespite the grandeur of Kronos and the atmosphere presented, the online slot graphics are quite simple and basic. But playing and betting on the game's 20 paylines is made easy. The only thing left to do is watch the reels spin, wait for winning combinations and cash in on Kronos, and hope for the activation of free spins. If you're a gambler looking for exciting twists and great adrenaline rushes, this may not be the game for you. But if winning without having to master too many complicated extras is your aim, then Kronos is your perfect match. And with an RTP of 95.94%, it's in line with the industry average.",

The player can join this deity and discover the winning and lucky plays of a machine that allows, among other things, to win a high number of free spins. The maximum offered is 100 free spins! Below, we will discover the features of the slot, and above all, how to challenge its board to obtain winning symbols that will unlock dream jackpots!\nGraphics and game symbols\nWhen we speak of deities, where does our mind immediately go? To ancient Greece, where the Gods and Olympus meet and come to life thanks to well-made graphics. We find a background of clouds ready to surround the great entrance to the realm of the Gods. And that's where the mighty Kronos appears, who, in addition to ruling time, is accompanied by winged horses and magical objects. The slot machine has a very classic structure consisting of 5 reels and 20 paylines. Each gamer is given the opportunity to activate the autoplay function so as to enjoy the show without interacting with the game. The reels can move on their own and respect the bet limit that has been manually set. Consider that each bet ranges from € 0.01 to a maximum of € 3.00. The machine presents a series of symbols that are fundamental for the regular progress of the game. The icons we find represent the same Kronos, the ancient temple; the prestigious winged horse Pegasus; the enchanted ring, and the throne. Completing the gaming park are the symbols of the playing cards, namely hearts, spades, diamonds, and flowers.\nThe Wild symbol is important, designed in the form of a golden lion, whose power is to replace all game symbols except for the Scatter. The latter is the letter K with wings, which will win up to 100 free spins. This is the only bonus that can be found during gameplay: with 3 gold medals, 10 free spins are obtained, with 4 there are 25 spins, and with 5, 100 spins are obtained.\nFinal thoughts on the Kronos slot\nDespite the graphic expectations based on the grandeur of the great Kronos and the presented atmosphere, the online slot machine is quite simple and very basic. Betting is easy, interacting with its 20 paylines, and that's it. All that remains is to observe the progress of the reels, wait for Kronos wins to be marked and collected, and hope for the activation of the free spin bonus. If you're looking for a slot with twists and great adrenaline, it's certainly not the right solution for you, but it's ideal for those who want to win without having to interact with a game that is too rich in twists or extra bonuses. Not bad is its RTP (Return to Player) which stops at a percentage of 95.94%, in line with the industry average.\n            ",

Below, we will discover the features of the slot, and above all, how to challenge its board to obtain winning symbols that will unlock dream jackpots!\nGraphics and game symbols\nWhen we speak of deities, where does our mind immediately go? To ancient Greece, where the Gods and Olympus meet and come to life thanks to well-made graphics. We find a background of clouds ready to surround the great entrance to the realm of the Gods. And that's where the mighty Kronos appears, who, in addition to ruling time, is accompanied by winged horses and magical objects. The slot machine has a very classic structure consisting of 5 reels and 20 paylines. Each gamer is given the opportunity to activate the autoplay function so as to enjoy the show without interacting with the game.

The machine presents a series of symbols that are fundamental for the regular progress of the game. The icons we find represent the same Kronos, the ancient temple; the prestigious winged horse Pegasus; the enchanted ring, and the throne. Completing the gaming park are the symbols of the playing cards, namely hearts, spades, diamonds, and flowers.\nThe Wild symbol is important, designed in the form of a golden lion, whose power is to replace all game symbols except for the Scatter.

This is the only bonus that can be found during gameplay: with 3 gold medals, 10 free spins are obtained, with 4 there are 25 spins, and with 5, 100 spins are obtained.\nFinal thoughts on the Kronos slot\nDespite the graphic expectations based on the grandeur of the great Kronos and the presented atmosphere, the online slot machine is quite simple and very basic. Betting is easy, interacting with its 20 paylines, and that's it. All that remains is to observe the progress of the reels, wait for Kronos wins to be marked and collected, and hope for the activation of the free spin bonus. If you're looking for a slot with twists and great adrenaline, it's certainly not the right solution for you, but it's ideal for those who want to win without having to interact with a game that is too rich in twists or extra bonuses.

The player can join this deity and discover the winning and lucky plays of a machine that allows, among other things, to win a high number of free spins. The maximum offered is 100 free spins! Below, we will discover the features of the slot, and above all, how to challenge its board to obtain winning symbols that will unlock dream jackpots!\nGraphics and game symbols\nWhen we speak of deities, where does our mind immediately go? To ancient Greece, where the Gods and Olympus meet and come to life thanks to well-made graphics. We find a background of clouds ready to surround the great entrance to the realm of the Gods. And that's where the mighty Kronos appears, who, in addition to ruling time, is accompanied by winged horses and magical objects. The slot machine has a very classic structure consisting of 5 reels and 20 paylines. Each gamer is given the opportunity to activate the autoplay function so as to enjoy the show without interacting with the game. The reels can move on their own and respect the bet limit that has been manually set. Consider that each bet ranges from € 0.01 to a maximum of € 3.00. The machine presents a series of symbols that are fundamental for the regular progress of the game. The icons we find represent the same Kronos, the ancient temple; the prestigious winged horse Pegasus; the enchanted ring, and the throne. Completing the gaming park are the symbols of the playing cards, namely hearts, spades, diamonds, and flowers.\nThe Wild symbol is important, designed in the form of a golden lion, whose power is to replace all game symbols except for the Scatter. The latter is the letter K with wings, which will win up to 100 free spins. This is the only bonus that can be found during gameplay: with 3 gold medals, 10 free spins are obtained, with 4 there are 25 spins, and with 5, 100 spins are obtained.\nFinal thoughts on the Kronos slot\nDespite the graphic expectations based on the grandeur of the great Kronos and the presented atmosphere, the online slot machine is quite simple and very basic. Betting is easy, interacting with its 20 paylines, and that's it. All that remains is to observe the progress of the reels, wait for Kronos wins to be marked and collected, and hope for the activation of the free spin bonus. If you're looking for a slot with twists and great adrenaline, it's certainly not the right solution for you, but it's ideal for those who want to win without having to interact with a game that is too rich in twists or extra bonuses. Not bad is its RTP (Return to Player) which stops at a percentage of 95.94%, in line with the industry average.\n        ",
