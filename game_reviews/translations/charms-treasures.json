Personaggio della tradizione irlandese, il lepraucano era famoso anche per la sua velocità e astuzia. Appena accediamo alla schermata principale di Charms & Treasures, notiamo la pentola piena di monete d’oro e dietro l’arcobaleno che si perde nel cielo. Lo sfondo è una campagna sterminata con alberi dalle alte cime smosse dal vento. I simboli di grandi dimensioni hanno un’ottima definizione, con linee nette e colori brillanti che li rendono chiari e ben visibili, tutto a vantaggio della giocabilità.\n \n \nCaratteristiche di Charms & Treasures\nLa griglia con la classica forma 5×3 accoglie 50 linee di pagamento fisse. La puntata minima per ogni Spin è di 0,25 €, un costo contenuto che rende il gioco adatto a ogni tipologia di scommettitore. La vincita massima non è niente male, visto che corrisponde a 1.414 volte il valore della puntata.\nTra le varie funzioni presenti nel gioco, la più utile è senza dubbio l’Autospin che ci permette di impostare un numero di giri automatici compreso tra 5 e 100 e di definire anche dei limiti di vincita e di perdita che una volta superati arrestano        la modalità Auto.\nCharms & Treasures ha una volatilità alta e un RTP pari al 95%.\n \nCome vincere con Charms & Treasures\nIn Charms & Treasures vengono considerate combo vincenti tutte quelle formate da almeno tre simboli e che si sviluppano dal primo rullo di sinistra procedendo verso destra. Uniche eccezioni la pentola d’oro e il quadrifoglio con i quali si vince anche con una combo di 2. Ciliegie, ferro di cavallo, palloncino e cuore sono i simboli di minor valore, a seguire troviamo la luna, il numero sette e la stella. Le vincite migliori sono però quelle determinate dal quadrifoglio e dalla pentola piena di monete d’oro, oltre che dal Wild. Infatti, oltre a sostituire tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter, il Wild ripaga al pari del simbolo più remunerativo. Il Leprechaun è lo Scatter e può atterrare solo sui rulli 2, 3 e 4, regalando minimo 8 Free Spins. Il gioco Bonus si gioca su una griglia speciale: le 3 bobine centrali si uniscono e accolgono un solo grande simbolo in formato 3×3, aumentando in modo esponenziale la possibilità di creare combinazioni paganti dagli importi molto alti. Se nel rullo centrale atterrerà un altro Scatter, allora verranno aggiunti tre Free Spins.\nCliccando sul pulsante del carrello è possibile acquistare la funzione Bonus.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nDove posso giocare a Charms & Treasures?\n\nQuesta slot è disponibile in tutti i maggiori casinò online dotati di certificazione governativa AAMS.\n\n\n\nQual è la volatilità?\n\nIn Charms & Treasures la volatilità è alta.\n\n\n\nCome posso accedere al gioco bonus?\n\nCi sono due possibilità: la prima è sperare che sui rulli atterrino almeno tre Scatter, la seconda è cliccare sul tasto del carrello e acquistare la funzione.\n\n\n\n",

A character from Irish tradition, the Leprechaun was famous for their speed and cunning. As soon as we access the main screen of Charms & Treasures, we notice the pot full of gold coins and the rainbow disappearing into the sky.

The minimum bet for each spin is €0.25, a reasonable cost that makes the game suitable for all types of bettors. The maximum win is not bad, as it corresponds to 1,414 times the value of the bet.\nAmong the various features present in the game, the most useful is undoubtedly the Autospin that allows us to set a number of automatic spins between 5 and 100 and define win and loss limits that, once exceeded, stop the Auto mode.\nCharms & Treasures has high volatility and an RTP of 95%.\n \nHow to win with Charms & Treasures\nIn Charms & Treasures, winning combos are formed by at least three symbols and develop from the first reel on the left, proceeding to the right.

However, the best wins are determined by the four-leaf clover and the pot full of gold coins, as well as the Wild. In fact, in addition to replacing all symbols except for the Scatter, the Wild pays as much as the most rewarding symbol. The Leprechaun is the Scatter and can land only on reels 2, 3 and 4, giving a minimum of 8 Free Spins.

But keep in mind that your reward won't be a pot of gold, but hopefully a lot of winnings from this slot game.</p><p>One of the things we love about Charms & Treasures is how the graphics are executed. The game developers paid attention to detail, and it shows. The colors are bright and bold, and the lines are sharp. When you win, the graphics and sound effects complement each other, creating an immersive experience.</p><p>The background of the game is a vast countryside with tall trees swaying in the wind. It creates a serene atmosphere, unlike the chaos of the city. You'll feel at ease, and you might even forget that you're playing a slot game.</p><p>The symbols on the screen are large and easy to read. It's especially helpful when you're trying to follow the game's logic and figure out what the combinations mean. It's a good thing, too, because let's face it: none of us want to squint at the screen for hours. The game's visuals and theme come together to create a fun and enjoyable gaming experience.</p>\"\n}"

A character from Irish tradition, the Leprechaun was famous for their speed and cunning. As soon as we access the main screen of Charms & Treasures, we notice the pot full of gold coins and the rainbow disappearing into the sky. The background is a vast countryside with tall trees swaying in the wind. The symbols, of large dimensions, have excellent definition with sharp lines and bright colors that make them clear and visible, all in favor of gameplay.\n \nFeatures of Charms & Treasures\nThe classic 5x3 grid accommodates 50 fixed pay lines. The minimum bet for each spin is €0.25, a reasonable cost that makes the game suitable for all types of bettors. The maximum win is not bad, as it corresponds to 1,414 times the value of the bet.\nAmong the various features present in the game, the most useful is undoubtedly the Autospin that allows us to set a number of automatic spins between 5 and 100 and define win and loss limits that, once exceeded, stop the Auto mode.\nCharms & Treasures has high volatility and an RTP of 95%.\n \nHow to win with Charms & Treasures\nIn Charms & Treasures, winning combos are formed by at least three symbols and develop from the first reel on the left, proceeding to the right. The only exceptions are the pot of gold and the four-leaf clover with which you can also win with a combo of two. Cherries, horseshoes, balloons, and hearts are the symbols of lesser value, followed by the moon, the number seven, and the star. However, the best wins are determined by the four-leaf clover and the pot full of gold coins, as well as the Wild. In fact, in addition to replacing all symbols except for the Scatter, the Wild pays as much as the most rewarding symbol. The Leprechaun is the Scatter and can land only on reels 2, 3 and 4, giving a minimum of 8 Free Spins. The Bonus game is played on a special grid: the three central reels are united and host a single large 3x3 format symbol, exponentially increasing the possibility of creating high-paying combinations. If another Scatter lands on the central reel, then three Free Spins will be added. By clicking on the cart button it is possible to purchase the Bonus function.\n\nFAQs\nWhere can I play Charms & Treasures?\n\nThis slot is available in all major online casinos with an AAMS government certification.\n\nWhat is the volatility?\n\nIn Charms & Treasures, the volatility is high.\n\nHow can I access the Bonus game?\n\nThere are two possibilities: the first is to hope that at least three Scatters land on the reels, the second is to click on the cart button and purchase the function.\n            ",

A character from Irish tradition, the Leprechaun was famous for their speed and cunning. As soon as we access the main screen of Charms & Treasures, we notice the pot full of gold coins and the rainbow disappearing into the sky. The background is a vast countryside with tall trees swaying in the wind. The symbols, of large dimensions, have excellent definition with sharp lines and bright colors that make them clear and visible, all in favor of gameplay.\n \nFeatures of Charms & Treasures\nThe classic 5x3 grid accommodates 50 fixed pay lines. The minimum bet for each spin is €0.25, a reasonable cost that makes the game suitable for all types of bettors. The maximum win is not bad, as it corresponds to 1,414 times the value of the bet.\nAmong the various features present in the game, the most useful is undoubtedly the Autospin that allows us to set a number of automatic spins between 5 and 100 and define win and loss limits that, once exceeded, stop the Auto mode.\nCharms & Treasures has high volatility and an RTP of 95%.\n \nHow to win with Charms & Treasures\nIn Charms & Treasures, winning combos are formed by at least three symbols and develop from the first reel on the left, proceeding to the right. The only exceptions are the pot of gold and the four-leaf clover with which you can also win with a combo of two. Cherries, horseshoes, balloons, and hearts are the symbols of lesser value, followed by the moon, the number seven, and the star. However, the best wins are determined by the four-leaf clover and the pot full of gold coins, as well as the Wild. In fact, in addition to replacing all symbols except for the Scatter, the Wild pays as much as the most rewarding symbol. The Leprechaun is the Scatter and can land only on reels 2, 3 and 4, giving a minimum of 8 Free Spins. The Bonus game is played on a special grid: the three central reels are united and host a single large 3x3 format symbol, exponentially increasing the possibility of creating high-paying combinations. If another Scatter lands on the central reel, then three Free Spins will be added. By clicking on the cart button it is possible to purchase the Bonus function.\n\nFAQs\nWhere can I play Charms & Treasures?\n\nThis slot is available in all major online casinos with an AAMS government certification.\n\nWhat is the volatility?\n\nIn Charms & Treasures, the volatility is high.\n\nHow can I access the Bonus game?\n\nThere are two possibilities: the first is to hope that at least three Scatters land on the reels, the second is to click on the cart button and purchase the function.\n            ",
