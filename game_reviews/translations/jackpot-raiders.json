The Jackpot Raiders slot game accepts bets on a layout of five reels and three rows of reels. The game's bets are configured using a single setting, the coin value. The result in the cash betting window is linked to the value of the coins, which is automatically multiplied through the game's pay lines.\n\nWith a starting coin value of just 0.005, the starting bet is £0.10.

Regardless of the bet per spin, the Jackpot Raiders slot will always have all pay lines as the background to the reel's action.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nLike any other slot game, Jackpot Raiders has its paytable.

Both award ten free spins, but four scatters also pay 1000x coins, and five pay 10,000x.\n\nThen the game shows the rolled-up map symbols. These do not pay anything, but collecting five maps of the same color provides ten free spins and a jackpot gem.\n\nThen there is the Pick and Click game, which opens a series of treasure chests. Choose one and have fun with the compass that could bring the quadrant into 10 free spins mode.\n\nAll jackpot free spins have a x3 multiplier.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf you want to continue living Indiana Jones experiences, the choice of slot machines on the Internet is very varied. For example, we suggest playing Indiana Jones: Treasure of The Incas, the Slot produced by Megagroup and offering 25 paylines."

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay and Features\nPaylines and Jackpot Prizes\nSymbols and Values\nBetting Options\nComparison to Other Indiana Jones-themed Slot Games\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Jackpot Raiders\nExperience the thrill of the incredible 20 payline slot game called Jackpot Raiders. This five-reel slot with three rows offers a return to player of 96.30%. This Indiana Jones themed jackpot slot game offers a 10,000x prize that can be won during the bonus free spins, along with an additional jackpot prize that can be won by collecting five of the same gems. The most important symbol in the base game is 4000x.\n\nIndiana Jones Style Graphics\nThis Yggdrasil Indiana Jones-themed slot machine provides a great source of entertainment and the chance to win the jackpot prize or symbol winning prizes. The Jackpot Raiders slot game accepts bets on a layout of five reels and three rows of reels. The game's bets are configured using a single setting, the coin value. The result in the cash betting window is linked to the value of the coins, which is automatically multiplied through the game's pay lines.\n\nWith a starting coin value of just 0.005, the starting bet is £0.10. Moving through the subsequent small and medium bets, those who want to engage in high-stakes action can opt for the penultimate bet of £20.00 or the maximum bet of £40.00 per spin. These bets are made using a £1.00 and £2.00 coin per line, respectively.\n\nTo spin the reels, use the spin button, located in the center and just below the third and middle reel. The game has a total of 20 pay lines that are always active. Regardless of the bet per spin, the Jackpot Raiders slot will always have all pay lines as the background to the reel's action.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nLike any other slot game, Jackpot Raiders has its paytable. This is where we can see the symbol pays, bonus feature information, and game details. Access the paytable from the more button, located in the bottom left corner of the page, and then selecting the 'i' icon from the list.\n\nThe most valuable symbol in Jackpot Raiders is the game's Scatter/Bonus symbol. Land five of these and get 10,000 coins multiplied by the line bet, plus ten free spins. Among the standard Jackpot Raiders slot symbols, the most valuable is Sam the adventurer, followed by his companion, Bear. Five of these symbols on a payline award 4000x and 2000x prizes, respectively, multiplied by the line bet. There is another high-value symbol in the hat, which pays 1000x, and not too shabby is the backpack, paying 750x on the line.\n\nAnd how does this translate into real money? Let's say you get a win of 5 Sam symbols and you played £20.00 per spin, which is £1.00 per line. If the five symbols land on the same payline, the prize will be 4000x symbol credits multiplied by £1.00, equal to £4000.\n\nThe first prize of 10,000 on the bet line would amount to £10,000 on the £20.00 bet.\n\nThere are three ways to activate the bonus. One is by collecting three or more scatters. Both will award 10 free spins, but four scatters will also pay 1000x coins, and five will pay 10,000x.\n\nThen, the game displays the rolled-up map symbols. These do not pay anything, but collecting five maps of the same color will provide ten free spins and a jackpot gem.\n\nThen there is the Pick and Click game, which opens a series of treasure chests. Choose one and revel in the compass that could lead the quadrant into 10 free spin mode.\n\nAll jackpot free spins have a x3 multiplier.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you want to continue living Indiana Jones adventures, the choice of slot machines on the internet is enormous. We suggest playing Indiana Jones: Treasure of The Incas, the slot produced by Megagroup and offering 25 paylines.\n            ",

This five-reel slot with three rows offers a return to player of 96.30%. This Indiana Jones themed jackpot slot game offers a 10,000x prize that can be won during the bonus free spins, along with an additional jackpot prize that can be won by collecting five of the same gems. The most important symbol in the base game is 4000x.\n\nIndiana Jones Style Graphics\nThis Yggdrasil Indiana Jones-themed slot machine provides a great source of entertainment and the chance to win the jackpot prize or symbol winning prizes. The Jackpot Raiders slot game accepts bets on a layout of five reels and three rows of reels. The game's bets are configured using a single setting, the coin value. The result in the cash betting window is linked to the value of the coins, which is automatically multiplied through the game's pay lines.\n\nWith a starting coin value of just 0.005, the starting bet is £0.10. Moving through the subsequent small and medium bets, those who want to engage in high-stakes action can opt for the penultimate bet of £20.00 or the maximum bet of £40.00 per spin. These bets are made using a £1.00 and £2.00 coin per line, respectively.\n\nTo spin the reels, use the spin button, located in the center and just below the third and middle reel. The game has a total of 20 pay lines that are always active. Regardless of the bet per spin, the Jackpot Raiders slot will always have all pay lines as the background to the reel's action.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nLike any other slot game, Jackpot Raiders has its paytable. This is where we can see the symbol pays, bonus feature information, and game details. Access the paytable from the more button, located in the bottom left corner of the page, and then selecting the 'i' icon from the list.\n\nThe most valuable symbol in Jackpot Raiders is the game's Scatter/Bonus symbol. Land five of these and get 10,000 coins multiplied by the line bet, plus ten free spins. Among the standard Jackpot Raiders slot symbols, the most valuable is Sam the adventurer, followed by his companion, Bear. Five of these symbols on a payline award 4000x and 2000x prizes, respectively, multiplied by the line bet. There is another high-value symbol in the hat, which pays 1000x, and not too shabby is the backpack, paying 750x on the line.\n\nAnd how does this translate into real money? Let's say you get a win of 5 Sam symbols and you played £20.00 per spin, which is £1.00 per line. If the five symbols land on the same payline, the prize will be 4000x symbol credits multiplied by £1.00, equal to £4000.\n\nThe first prize of 10,000 on the bet line would amount to £10,000 on the £20.00 bet.\n\nThere are three ways to activate the bonus. One is by collecting three or more scatters. Both will award 10 free spins, but four scatters will also pay 1000x coins, and five will pay 10,000x.\n\nThen, the game displays the rolled-up map symbols. These do not pay anything, but collecting five maps of the same color will provide ten free spins and a jackpot gem.\n\nThen there is the Pick and Click game, which opens a series of treasure chests. Choose one and revel in the compass that could lead the quadrant into 10 free spin mode.\n\nAll jackpot free spins have a x3 multiplier.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you want to continue living Indiana Jones adventures, the choice of slot machines on the internet is enormous. We suggest playing Indiana Jones: Treasure of The Incas, the slot produced by Megagroup and offering 25 paylines.\n            ",

This five-reel slot with three rows offers a return to player of 96.30%. This Indiana Jones themed jackpot slot game offers a 10,000x prize that can be won during the bonus free spins, along with an additional jackpot prize that can be won by collecting five of the same gems. The most important symbol in the base game is 4000x.\n\nIndiana Jones Style Graphics\nThis Yggdrasil Indiana Jones-themed slot machine provides a great source of entertainment and the chance to win the jackpot prize or symbol winning prizes. The Jackpot Raiders slot game accepts bets on a layout of five reels and three rows of reels. The game's bets are configured using a single setting, the coin value. The result in the cash betting window is linked to the value of the coins, which is automatically multiplied through the game's pay lines.\n\nWith a starting coin value of just 0.005, the starting bet is £0.10. Moving through the subsequent small and medium bets, those who want to engage in high-stakes action can opt for the penultimate bet of £20.00 or the maximum bet of £40.00 per spin. These bets are made using a £1.00 and £2.00 coin per line, respectively.\n\nTo spin the reels, use the spin button, located in the center and just below the third and middle reel. The game has a total of 20 pay lines that are always active. Regardless of the bet per spin, the Jackpot Raiders slot will always have all pay lines as the background to the reel's action.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nLike any other slot game, Jackpot Raiders has its paytable. This is where we can see the symbol pays, bonus feature information, and game details. Access the paytable from the more button, located in the bottom left corner of the page, and then selecting the 'i' icon from the list.\n\nThe most valuable symbol in Jackpot Raiders is the game's Scatter/Bonus symbol. Land five of these and get 10,000 coins multiplied by the line bet, plus ten free spins. Among the standard Jackpot Raiders slot symbols, the most valuable is Sam the adventurer, followed by his companion, Bear. Five of these symbols on a payline award 4000x and 2000x prizes, respectively, multiplied by the line bet. There is another high-value symbol in the hat, which pays 1000x, and not too shabby is the backpack, paying 750x on the line.\n\nAnd how does this translate into real money? Let's say you get a win of 5 Sam symbols and you played £20.00 per spin, which is £1.00 per line. If the five symbols land on the same payline, the prize will be 4000x symbol credits multiplied by £1.00, equal to £4000.\n\nThe first prize of 10,000 on the bet line would amount to £10,000 on the £20.00 bet.\n\nThere are three ways to activate the bonus. One is by collecting three or more scatters. Both will award 10 free spins, but four scatters will also pay 1000x coins, and five will pay 10,000x.\n\nThen, the game displays the rolled-up map symbols. These do not pay anything, but collecting five maps of the same color will provide ten free spins and a jackpot gem.\n\nThen there is the Pick and Click game, which opens a series of treasure chests. Choose one and revel in the compass that could lead the quadrant into 10 free spin mode.\n\nAll jackpot free spins have a x3 multiplier.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you want to continue living Indiana Jones adventures, the choice of slot machines on the internet is enormous. We suggest playing Indiana Jones: Treasure of The Incas, the slot produced by Megagroup and offering 25 paylines.\n            ",
