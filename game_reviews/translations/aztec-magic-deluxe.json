Symbols are a continuous reference to Earth and Sun, key elements of this culture.\n\nAs per BGaming's tradition, the graphics immediately catch the eye for the definitiveness with which the symbols are represented and for the attention to detail. The grid is embedded inside a jewel with two torches lit on the pillars. At the bottom, we can find the main buttons, including the one to change the pay lines and the bet.\n\nThe music is a mix of nature sounds, including the sound of water and the cries of the animals populating the forest, and the beat of drums.\n\nSlot Features:\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with variable pay lines from one to fifteen. This operation will not affect the cost per spin, which will always range from €0.01 to €1, but rather the probability of winning, which decreases with fewer active lines.\n\nWith the Autoplay function, you can activate from 10 to 1,000 automatic spins, and through pre-selected parameters, you can decide when to stop them.\n\nWinning combinations refer to all those that occur on an active pay line with adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. In the case of multiple winning combos on the same line, only the highest one will be paid, while in the case of combos on different lines, the winnings will be added together.\n\nThe volatility is medium, while the RTP value is very good, at 96.96%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\nThere are seven basic symbols, four non-themed and three themed. The first represents the cards good for a royal flush, ranging from ten to ace. The three medallions are instead payers. The first, silver, can pay up to 100 times the bet, the bronze up to 300, and the gold up to 500.\n\nThe Aztec warrior is the Wild symbol. In addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, it is paying, and in fact, it pays more than all. Every time it appears, it triples the winnings, but if it appears with 5 symbols, you can receive up to 5,000 times the bet! The priestess is instead the Scatter symbol, and can appear anywhere on the grid. Three, four or five Scatters give up to 10 free spins.\n\nIn Aztec Magic Deluxe there is also the Gamble function to try and double the winnings. In this case, every time a sum must be cashed, you can decide whether to risk it in a card game. In this case, a covered card will appear in the center of the screen, with two buttons on the sides, Red and Black. Our goal is to discover the color of the covered card.\n            ",

Does it get any better than that? We doubt it!</p>\n\t<p>But let's not forget about the Gamble function. This is where things can get a little risky, but also more rewarding. Players can try to double their winnings by guessing the color of a covered card. If you're feeling lucky, you might as well go for it.

Symbols are a continuous reference to Earth and Sun, key elements of this culture.\n\nAs per BGaming's tradition, the graphics immediately catch the eye for the definitiveness with which the symbols are represented and for the attention to detail. The grid is embedded inside a jewel with two torches lit on the pillars. At the bottom, we can find the main buttons, including the one to change the pay lines and the bet.\n\nThe music is a mix of nature sounds, including the sound of water and the cries of the animals populating the forest, and the beat of drums.\n\nSlot Features:\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with variable pay lines from one to fifteen. This operation will not affect the cost per spin, which will always range from €0.01 to €1, but rather the probability of winning, which decreases with fewer active lines.\n\nWith the Autoplay function, you can activate from 10 to 1,000 automatic spins, and through pre-selected parameters, you can decide when to stop them.\n\nWinning combinations refer to all those that occur on an active pay line with adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. In the case of multiple winning combos on the same line, only the highest one will be paid, while in the case of combos on different lines, the winnings will be added together.\n\nThe volatility is medium, while the RTP value is very good, at 96.96%.\n\nSymbols and Features:\nThere are seven basic symbols, four non-themed and three themed. The first represents the cards good for a royal flush, ranging from ten to ace. The three medallions are instead payers. The first, silver, can pay up to 100 times the bet, the bronze up to 300, and the gold up to 500.\n\nThe Aztec warrior is the Wild symbol. In addition to replacing all symbols except the Scatter, it is paying, and in fact, it pays more than all. Every time it appears, it triples the winnings, but if it appears with 5 symbols, you can receive up to 5,000 times the bet! The priestess is instead the Scatter symbol, and can appear anywhere on the grid. Three, four or five Scatters give up to 10 free spins.\n\nIn Aztec Magic Deluxe there is also the Gamble function to try and double the winnings. In this case, every time a sum must be cashed, you can decide whether to risk it in a card game. In this case, a covered card will appear in the center of the screen, with two buttons on the sides, Red and Black. Our goal is to discover the color of the covered card.\n            ",
