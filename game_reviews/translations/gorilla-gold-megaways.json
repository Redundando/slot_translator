This slot game’s structure is unique, with four slots rolled into one. With 6 vertical reels, 1 horizontal top reel, and 2 to 7 symbols, there are several things to follow during a single spin. This Megaways engine offers up to 117,000 pay lines per slot, giving you an incredible 470,000 ways to win across the 4 areas available to you.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nThe graphic presentation is stunningly well done. The four slot areas are the standout feature of this game for offering a phenomenal bonus game. The Power 4 Play gameplay mechanic is spectacular, and the graphics and innovation are simply amazing, speaking for themselves.\n\nWhen it comes to winning symbols, you need at least 3 to trigger a payout except for the Gorilla, which requires only 2. The jungle animal symbols include a purple snake, a crocodile, a tiger, and the Gorilla, the game’s protagonist who is worth up to 50 times your bet. The diamond symbol is the Scatter and triggers the Gorilla Gold Bonus, offering players from 20 free spins + 15 super spins to a maximum of 35 free spins + 30 super spins. There's also a gamble function, where you can increase your spins on a wheel divided between green (offering enhancers) and red (offering smaller wins).\n\nEach bet made is multiplied by 5, i.e., 4x for the 4 slots and 1x for the super bet. The super spin function, when unlocked, allows you to multiply your win with a cascade effect across all 4 slots. Any winning symbols explode on the reels to make way for new symbols, offering even more winning chances. The betting range for the game ranges from €0.10 to €10.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Gorilla Gold Megaways\n\nGorilla Gold Megaways' features are top-quality and have impeccable animations: from the smooth reel rotation to the sound effects that enhance the visual presentation, you can appreciate the care that went into its development. The game has a jungle theme and dark color palette across the four game zones. If you find the game too slow, the fast play button is available for faster rotations. Overall, this is an excellent title that has another advantage worth noting: an incredible RTP value of 97%!",

We're talking about Gorilla Gold Megaways, which has a rather unusual structure of 4 slots grouped in one. There is a lot to follow during a simple spin, and it's surprising to see how it flows smoothly. All 4 parts that make it up are identical and feature 6 vertical reels, one top horizontal reel, and a number of symbols ranging from 2 to 7 symbols. With the amazing Megaways engine, up to 117,000 pay lines per slot can be used. Doing the math, the maximum is 470,000 ways to win in the 4 areas at your disposal!\n\nGame graphics and symbols\nGraphically speaking, there's really little to say because it's such a well-crafted slot that it's speechless. As we said, the absolute strength is the four slots to maximize a phenomenal bonus game. The gameplay mechanics, with its Power 4 Play, is something incredible. In short, graphics and innovation need no introduction.\n\nThe player who logs online and starts this game will immediately realize the greatness we're talking about. To trigger a payout, it's necessary to find at least 3 winning symbols, except for the Gorilla, which requires only 2. Among the creatures of the jungle, we could find a purple snake, a crocodile, a tiger, and our protagonist, the Gorilla, which is worth up to 50 times the bet made.\n\nThe diamond symbol is the Scatter that activates the Gorilla Gold Bonus, which offers from 20 free spins + 15 super spins to a maximum of 35 free spins + 30 super spins. And let's also talk about the Gamble feature to increase spins on a wheel divided between green and red: in the former case, power-ups are received, while in the latter, smaller wins should be expected.\n\nEvery bet placed will be multiplied by 5 times, namely 4x for the 4 slots and 1x for the super bet. The Super Spins function, which is well executed, allows you to unlock 4 slots and multiply the winning cascade. In the latter case, winning symbols explode on the reels to make room for new symbols that will give you more chances of winning. It's possible to play with bets ranging from €0.10 to €10.\n\nFinal thoughts on Gorilla Gold Megaways\nThe functions of Gorilla Gold Megaways are of great quality, and the animations are impeccable: just admire the rotation of the reels, which manages to proceed perfectly smooth as oil, with sound effects that can also enrich the visual presentation. Obviously, we're in the jungle, with a dark-colored screen occupied by the 4 gaming zones. If the game seems too slow, you can use the button that speeds up the rotations. In short, it's a great title, and it has an additional advantage to keep an eye on: the slot relies on an incredible RTP value of 97%!\n            ",

We're talking about Gorilla Gold Megaways, which has a rather unusual structure of 4 slots grouped in one. There is a lot to follow during a simple spin, and it's surprising to see how it flows smoothly. All 4 parts that make it up are identical and feature 6 vertical reels, one top horizontal reel, and a number of symbols ranging from 2 to 7 symbols. With the amazing Megaways engine, up to 117,000 pay lines per slot can be used. Doing the math, the maximum is 470,000 ways to win in the 4 areas at your disposal!\n\nGame graphics and symbols\nGraphically speaking, there's really little to say because it's such a well-crafted slot that it's speechless. As we said, the absolute strength is the four slots to maximize a phenomenal bonus game. The gameplay mechanics, with its Power 4 Play, is something incredible. In short, graphics and innovation need no introduction.\n\nThe player who logs online and starts this game will immediately realize the greatness we're talking about. To trigger a payout, it's necessary to find at least 3 winning symbols, except for the Gorilla, which requires only 2. Among the creatures of the jungle, we could find a purple snake, a crocodile, a tiger, and our protagonist, the Gorilla, which is worth up to 50 times the bet made.\n\nThe diamond symbol is the Scatter that activates the Gorilla Gold Bonus, which offers from 20 free spins + 15 super spins to a maximum of 35 free spins + 30 super spins. And let's also talk about the Gamble feature to increase spins on a wheel divided between green and red: in the former case, power-ups are received, while in the latter, smaller wins should be expected.\n\nEvery bet placed will be multiplied by 5 times, namely 4x for the 4 slots and 1x for the super bet. The Super Spins function, which is well executed, allows you to unlock 4 slots and multiply the winning cascade. In the latter case, winning symbols explode on the reels to make room for new symbols that will give you more chances of winning. It's possible to play with bets ranging from €0.10 to €10.\n\nFinal thoughts on Gorilla Gold Megaways\nThe functions of Gorilla Gold Megaways are of great quality, and the animations are impeccable: just admire the rotation of the reels, which manages to proceed perfectly smooth as oil, with sound effects that can also enrich the visual presentation. Obviously, we're in the jungle, with a dark-colored screen occupied by the 4 gaming zones. If the game seems too slow, you can use the button that speeds up the rotations. In short, it's a great title, and it has an additional advantage to keep an eye on: the slot relies on an incredible RTP value of 97%!\n            ",
