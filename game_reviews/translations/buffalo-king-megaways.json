The fauna in this environment is diverse, including elk, wolves, lynx, eagles, and of course, buffalo, the mighty animal that lends its name to this slot. Pragmatic Play has done an excellent job of bringing the scorching climate of the Grand Canyon to life with warm colors ranging from orange to red to yellow. The large grid fills almost the entire screen, yet the buttons, special features, and information about the slot are well-distributed.\n\nOn the left, there is a button to buy free spins or the double chance to win. At the bottom, the credit, bet, and win are displayed, along with the Start button that, when held down, activates Autoplay.\n\nKey features\n\nThe grid has 5 reels and a variable number of rows ranging from 3 to 6 that change with each spin on all the reels. An additional row at the top sees symbols scrolling horizontally. The cascade mechanism means that with each winning combination, the symbols involved disappear and are replaced by new ones. The minimum bet per line is €0.01, with the Spin option costing €0.25. The maximum bet is €100. The win can reach 5,000 times the bet, and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, only the highest one will be paid. Wins are awarded when adjacent symbols of any size appear, with 200,704 ways to win. On each spin, the right-hand box shows how many chances of winning there are for that individual spin.\n\nPlayers can choose to activate 10 to 1,000 automatic spins and stop them immediately by clicking the stop button.\n\nBuffalo King Megaways has an excellent RTP of 96.52% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and features\n\nLow-value symbols are playing cards, from ten to ace. Then there is the elk, wolf, lynx, eagle, and buffalo. The rocky relief is the Wild symbol and substitutes for all other symbols except the Scatter. The Wild can appear on all reels except the first.\n\nThe golden coin with the buffalo's effigy is the Scatter symbol. When at least 3 land, a herd of buffalo crosses the reels, triggering Free Spins. The particularity of Bonus symbols is to also pay as follows:\n\n4 symbols pay 5x the bet and 12 free spins\n5 symbols pay 20x the bet and 17 free spins\n6 symbols pay 100x the bet and 22 free spins\n\nDuring Free Spins, Wild symbols have a double function: they replace all regular symbols and also give a 2x, 3x, or 5x multiplier. If more Wild symbols appear, the multipliers multiply and are added at the top, then applied to the win. Another 3 or more Bonus symbols during the special feature reward players with 5 additional free spins, with no limit on the number of reactivations.\n\nIn addition, players are offered the chance to buy winning opportunities, which doubles their chances of winning free spins. Alternatively, they can buy free spins directly at a cost of 100x the bet. In this case, the initial number of Scatters and therefore free spins is random.\n\nTranslation by Style Transfer:\n\nBuffalo King Megaways\n\nArizona is the most untamed state of the United States.

The fauna in this environment is diverse, including elk, wolves, lynx, eagles, and of course, buffalo, the mighty animal that lends its name to this slot. Pragmatic Play has done an excellent job of bringing the scorching climate of the Grand Canyon to life with warm colors ranging from orange to red to yellow. The large grid fills almost the entire screen, yet the buttons, special features, and information about the slot are well-distributed.\n\nOn the left, there is a button to buy free spins or the double chance to win. At the bottom, the credit, bet, and win are displayed, along with the Start button that, when held down, activates Autoplay.\n\nKey features\n\nThe grid has 5 reels and a variable number of rows ranging from 3 to 6 that change with each spin on all the reels. An additional row at the top sees symbols scrolling horizontally. The cascade mechanism means that with each winning combination, the symbols involved disappear and are replaced by new ones. The minimum bet per line is €0.01, with the Spin option costing €0.25. The maximum bet is €100. The win can reach 5,000 times the bet, and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, only the highest one will be paid. Wins are awarded when adjacent symbols of any size appear, with 200,704 ways to win. On each spin, the right-hand box shows how many chances of winning there are for that individual spin.\n\nPlayers can choose to activate 10 to 1,000 automatic spins and stop them immediately by clicking the stop button.\n\nBuffalo King Megaways has an excellent RTP of 96.52% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and features\n\nLow-value symbols are playing cards, from ten to ace. Then there is the elk, wolf, lynx, eagle, and buffalo. The rocky relief is the Wild symbol and substitutes for all other symbols except the Scatter. The Wild can appear on all reels except the first.\n\nThe golden coin with the buffalo's effigy is the Scatter symbol.

If more Wild symbols appear, the multipliers multiply and are added at the top, then applied to the win. Another 3 or more Bonus symbols during the special feature reward players with 5 additional free spins, with no limit on the number of reactivations.\n\nIn addition, players are offered the chance to buy winning opportunities, which doubles their chances of winning free spins.

Pragmatic Play has done an excellent job of bringing the scorching climate of the Grand Canyon to life with warm colors ranging from orange to red to yellow. The large grid fills almost the entire screen, yet the buttons, special features, and information about the slot are well-distributed.\n\nOn the left, there is a button to buy free spins or the double chance to win. At the bottom, the credit, bet, and win are displayed, along with the Start button that, when held down, activates Autoplay.\n\nKey features\n\nThe grid has 5 reels and a variable number of rows ranging from 3 to 6 that change with each spin on all the reels. An additional row at the top sees symbols scrolling horizontally. The cascade mechanism means that with each winning combination, the symbols involved disappear and are replaced by new ones. The minimum bet per line is €0.01, with the Spin option costing €0.25. The maximum bet is €100. The win can reach 5,000 times the bet, and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, only the highest one will be paid. Wins are awarded when adjacent symbols of any size appear, with 200,704 ways to win. On each spin, the right-hand box shows how many chances of winning there are for that individual spin.\n\nPlayers can choose to activate 10 to 1,000 automatic spins and stop them immediately by clicking the stop button.\n\nBuffalo King Megaways has an excellent RTP of 96.52% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and features\n\nLow-value symbols are playing cards, from ten to ace. Then there is the elk, wolf, lynx, eagle, and buffalo. The rocky relief is the Wild symbol and substitutes for all other symbols except the Scatter. The Wild can appear on all reels except the first.\n\nThe golden coin with the buffalo's effigy is the Scatter symbol. When at least 3 land, a herd of buffalo crosses the reels, triggering Free Spins. The particularity of Bonus symbols is to also pay as follows:\n\n4 symbols pay 5x the bet and 12 free spins\n5 symbols pay 20x the bet and 17 free spins\n6 symbols pay 100x the bet and 22 free spins\n\nDuring Free Spins, Wild symbols have a double function: they replace all regular symbols and also give a 2x, 3x, or 5x multiplier. If more Wild symbols appear, the multipliers multiply and are added at the top, then applied to the win. Another 3 or more Bonus symbols during the special feature reward players with 5 additional free spins, with no limit on the number of reactivations.\n\nIn addition, players are offered the chance to buy winning opportunities, which doubles their chances of winning free spins. Alternatively, they can buy free spins directly at a cost of 100x the bet.

In this case, the initial number of Scatters and therefore free spins is random.\n\nTranslation by Style Transfer:\n\nBuffalo King Megaways\n\nArizona is the most untamed state of the United States. It is where the Grand Canyon can be found, an expansive desert with rocks that is renowned worldwide. The wildlife of this environment is rich with elks, wolves, lynxes, eagles, and, of course, buffalos, the colossal animal from which this slot gains its name.\n\nGraphics-wise, Pragmatic Play did an impressive job of welcoming the scorching climate that is breathed between the deep canyons of the Grand Canyon. They used warm colors ranging from orange to red to yellow, and designed a grid with considerable dimensions that almost covers the entire screen but manage to evenly distribute the buttons, the special features, and the slot's details.\n\nOn the left, players can find buttons that enable the purchase of free spins or the double chance of winning. On the bottom of the screen, the credit, the bet, and the win are displayed, along with the Start button that, once pressed, activates the Autoplay feature.\n\nKey Features\n\nThe grid is formed by 5 reels and a variable number of rows ranging from 3 to 6. This number changes with every round, allowing chance to display its charm with each spin. At the top of the grid, there is an additional row that shows symbols, representing the renowned fauna of the canyon. The cascade mechanism implies that, with every winning combination, the elements involved disappear, making room for an exciting turnover. The minimum bet per line is €0.01, and with every Spin opportunity, the average cost is €0.25. The maximum bet is €100. The win can reach 5,000 times the bet, and in case of multiple combinations on the same line, the highest one will be paid. The game has 200,704 ways to win, with wins being awarded when adjacent symbols of any size appear. The right-hand box shows how many chances of winning there are for each spin.\n\nPlayers can activate between 10 to 1,000 automatic rounds. When needed, they can stop the Autoplay feature by pressing the designated button.\n\nBuffalo King Megaways offers an excellent RTP of 96.52% and high volatility, enhancing the allure of the venture.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nThe lower value symbols are the playing cards, from ten to ace. The high-value symbols include the elk, wolf, lynx, eagle, and buffalo, each representing a facet of the unyielding canyon. The rocky relief represents the Wild symbol and has the power to substitute all other symbols except the Scatter. The Wild can appear anywhere on the grid except on the first reel.\n\nThe golden coin with the buffalo's effigy is the Scatter symbol. When three or more of them appear on the reels, it signals the beginning of the Free Spins round. The Bonus symbols are remarkable as they also pay:\n\n4 Bonus symbols pay 5x the bet and 12 free spins\n5 Bonus symbols pay 20x the bet and 17 free spins\n6 Bonus symbols pay 100x the bet and 22 free spins\n\nDuring the Free Spins, the Wild symbols also have a multiplier function. In addition, they replace all regular symbols except the Scatter, and provide an extra multiplier of 2x, 3x, or 5x. More Wild symbols equal more multipliers, as they are added to the existing ones at the top before being applied to the win. When three or more Bonus symbols appear during the special feature, five more free spins are awarded, with no limit on the number of reactivations.\n\nPlayers have the chance to buy winning opportunities and double their chances of winning free spins. They can also buy free spins directly at a cost of 100x the bet. In this circumstance, the initial number of Scatters and free spins is random but represents the promise of a potentially great reward.\n        ",
