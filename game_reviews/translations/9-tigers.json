Può sembrare semplice, ma Wazdan ha dato una vita propria alla slot 9 Tigers. I giocatori possono vincere premi di più di 1000x la scommessa da un singolo giro.\n9 Tigers è un gioco che sembra essere stato progettato per il mercato asiatico. È caratterizzato da elementi Yin e Yang, fuoco e acqua, sotto forma di tigri elementari.

Sulla bobina rimangono una serie di simboli.\nDisegnando il tipo di tigre opposto sui campi rimanenti, il simbolo yin-yang si ferma in quella posizione. Completando i nove giri si ottiene un premio in denaro pagato per il numero di simboli yin-yang.\nA questo proposito, un simbolo paga 20x, due pagano 25x, tre pagano 30x e così via, con una vincita massima di 1000x volte la scommessa per tutti i nove simboli.\nUn’altra caratteristica unica è che 9 Tigers restituiscono la scommessa anche per la più piccola vittoria, che è una payline. Nel caso in cui tre simboli corrispondenti si fermino su una sola linea, il giocatore ottiene indietro 1,8x la scommessa. Due payline portano 2.8x, tre portano 3.8x. La sovvenzione ottimale è con sei e sette paylines: 16.8x sulla scommessa.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nScopri la Slot Machine a tema estremo oriente chiamata Golden Tiger.

While it may seem simple, Wazdan has given 9 Tigers its own life. Players can win prizes of over 1000x their bet from a single spin.\n9 Tigers is a game that seems to have been designed for the Asian market. It features Yin and Yang elements, Fire and Water, in the form of elemental tigers. A classic-looking slot, it can incorporate modern graphics and features.\nThe 3x3 reels spin with a total of 9 Tigers on them. Combinations will form on 8 lines, paying up to 1,000x the stake. There is only one real feature, the Tiger Bonus, which has two sides, Fire and Water, each of which works a little differently. Expect a game with an RTP of 96.19%, so it's the kind you would consider just right.\nAn Oriental-themed Graphics\nThe tigers have this ethereal glow around them and seem ready to leap, and they do so when a win is obtained. On one hand, you would want there to be more than one animal in the game, but then the game just requires two kinds of symbols.\nEach win is marked energetically in an electric light display around the symbols and across the paylines. An Oriental theme musical score fits very well with the game's theme and environment.\nThe Oriental theme is clear here, and it is also very well designed. You get two Tigers designed as Fire and Water elements, opposite sides. The Yin and Yang aspect is strong here, and is part of the two symbols that will appear on the reels. That's all for the symbol list, so you could say it's not a typical slot machine by any means. Overall, I like the look of the game, but apart from the number of reels, don't mistake it for a classic.\nThe game features only two symbols and one bonus symbol. The name 9 Tigers refers to the number of symbols that can land on the reel-set, which has three reels and three rows.

The available options are turtle, hare, and horse. You can imagine how each setting is reflected on the reels.\nBelow this button, 9 Tigers slot has an autoplay button (where available). Pressing this button opens the menu that allows you to choose from the number of automatic spins available. Further options are controls that allow you to have greater control over balance spending.\nLast but not least, bets can be selected from the bar below the reel-set. The smallest bet allowed is 20 credits, which is €0.20 per spin. 100 credits correspond to a bet of €1.00. The biggest bet is €100.00 per spin. Regardless of the bet amount, the game plays on all available paylines.\nThe bonus is triggered when there is a payout on all eight paylines with the fire or water tiger. In this case, the game triggers the Bonus Tigers, a nine-spin game. A series of symbols remain on the reel.\nBy drawing the type of opposite tiger on the remaining fields, the yin-yang symbol stops at that position.

Players press the spin button located in the temple. The game has two symbols, Fire and Water, and a bonus symbol. Players can choose the variance of the game and the speed at which the game rotates. There is an autoplay button that allows for a number of automatic spins available. The game has a betting range from €0.20 to €100 per spin, and it plays on all available paylines. 9 Tigers also returns the bet even for the smallest win, which is a payline.\n\nOriental-themed Graphics\n\n9 Tigers has an Oriental theme and only features two types of symbols. The Fire and Water elements are designed as Tigers and have an ethereal glow around them. The Yin and Yang aspect is evident in the design, and the musical score complements the theme and environment. Every win is marked energetically in an electric light display, and there is an overall feeling of classic and modern design.\n\nBonus Game\n\nThe Tiger Bonus is the only feature in the game and has two sides, Fire, and Water, each of which work differently. The bonus is triggered when there is a payout on all eight paylines with the Fire or Water Tiger. This action triggers the Bonus Tigers, a nine-spin game where a series of symbols remain on the reels. Completing the nine spins results in a cash prize paid for the number of Yin-Yang symbols. The maximum win is 1000x times the bet for all nine symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nGolden Tiger is a Far Eastern-themed slot machine that has five paylines on three retro reels and three rows. The game offers a top prize of 1000x in the base game and 10,000x in the bonus wheel feature. The minimum bet is 10p, and the maximum bet is 10 euros per spin. Filling the screen with the Golden Tiger symbol triggers the bonus wheel, while getting a stack of matching symbols on a reel triggers a x2 multiplier.\n\nPaylines and Reels\n\n9 Tigers has three-reels and three-rows, and eight-paylines. The name of the game pays homage to the number of symbols that can land on the reel-set, which is nine. Not every spin will fill every position with both or either of these symbols. Play with all eight paylines to win up to 1000x times the stake from a single spin of the reels.\n\nVariance Selection\n\nWazdan, the game's developer, has allowed players to select the variance of the random number generator. Players can press the chart symbol to the left of Spin and choose between low, medium, and high variance. This feature gives players more control over their gameplay experience, depending on their desired level of risk and reward.\n\nMaximum Payout\n\nPlayers can win prizes of over 1000x their bet from a single spin in 9 Tigers. Completing the nine spins in the bonus game results in a cash prize paid for the number of Yin-Yang symbols, with a maximum win of 1000x times the bet for all nine symbols. In addition, the game returns the bet even for the smallest win, which is a payline.\n\n        \n            ",

The game has eight paylines and a Tiger Bonus feature which has two variants, Fire and Water. Players have control over variance and rotation speed, and the betting amount can be selected from the bar below the reel-set.\n\nOriental-themed Graphics\n\n9 Tigers is aesthetically pleasing with an Oriental theme and modern graphics. The game has two symbols, Fire and Water tigers, that appear to leap off the screen with ethereal glows around them. Each win is marked by an electric light display, and the theme's music fits well with the overall environment.\n\nBonus Game\n\nThe Tiger Bonus is the only feature in 9 Tigers and it triggers when a player lands a payout on all eight paylines. Players get nine spins where the remaining fields on the reels must contain the opposite tiger type drawn by the yin-yang symbol to win a cash prize paid for the number of symbols. One symbol pays 20x the bet, and the maximum win is 1000x for all nine symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nGolden Tiger is a similar slot machine with five paylines, a Far Eastern theme, and three retro reels and rows. The game has a top prize of 1000x and 10,000x in the base game and the bonus wheel, respectively. A stack of matching symbols on a reel triggers a x2 multiplier, and filling the screen with the golden tiger symbol triggers the bonus wheel.\n\nPrize Potential\n\nPlayers can win prizes of over 1000x their bet from a single spin of 9 Tigers. The smallest win is a payline, and three matching symbols on a line reward the player with 1.8x the bet. Two paylines pay 2.8x, three pay 3.8x, and the optimal grant is with six and seven paylines at 16.8x the bet.\n\nNumber of Reels\n\n9 Tigers is a three-reel slot machine with three rows. It also has eight paylines and only two symbols, making it a unique game to play.\n\nSymbol List\n\nThe game features two symbols, Fire and Water Tigers, and the Yin-Yang symbol. The tigers represent elements and feature an ethereal glow around them, while the Yin-Yang symbol triggers the Tiger Bonus feature.\n\n        \n            ",

While it may seem simple, Wazdan has given 9 Tigers its own life. Players can win prizes of over 1000x their bet from a single spin.\n9 Tigers is a game that seems to have been designed for the Asian market. It features Yin and Yang elements, Fire and Water, in the form of elemental tigers. A classic-looking slot, it can incorporate modern graphics and features.\nThe 3x3 reels spin with a total of 9 Tigers on them. Combinations will form on 8 lines, paying up to 1,000x the stake. There is only one real feature, the Tiger Bonus, which has two sides, Fire and Water, each of which works a little differently. Expect a game with an RTP of 96.19%, so it's the kind you would consider just right.\nAn Oriental-themed Graphics\nThe tigers have this ethereal glow around them and seem ready to leap, and they do so when a win is obtained. On one hand, you would want there to be more than one animal in the game, but then the game just requires two kinds of symbols.\nEach win is marked energetically in an electric light display around the symbols and across the paylines. An Oriental theme musical score fits very well with the game's theme and environment.\nThe Oriental theme is clear here, and it is also very well designed. You get two Tigers designed as Fire and Water elements, opposite sides. The Yin and Yang aspect is strong here, and is part of the two symbols that will appear on the reels. That's all for the symbol list, so you could say it's not a typical slot machine by any means. Overall, I like the look of the game, but apart from the number of reels, don't mistake it for a classic.\nThe game features only two symbols and one bonus symbol. The name 9 Tigers refers to the number of symbols that can land on the reel-set, which has three reels and three rows. The number of paylines is eight, and not every spin will fill every position with both or either of these symbols.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nYou can sit in the temple, hidden somewhere in mythical Shaolin, by pressing the rotation button. The yin-yang symbol is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. On both the left and right sides of this button are buttons relevant to gameplay.\nWazdan is one of the few companies that allow players to select the variance of the random number generator. By pressing the chart symbol to the left of Spin, you can choose between low, medium, and high variance.\nOn the right, there is a button that allows you to choose the speed at which the game rotates. The available options are turtle, hare, and horse. You can imagine how each setting is reflected on the reels.\nBelow this button, 9 Tigers slot has an autoplay button (where available). Pressing this button opens the menu that allows you to choose from the number of automatic spins available. Further options are controls that allow you to have greater control over balance spending.\nLast but not least, bets can be selected from the bar below the reel-set. The smallest bet allowed is 20 credits, which is €0.20 per spin. 100 credits correspond to a bet of €1.00. The biggest bet is €100.00 per spin. Regardless of the bet amount, the game plays on all available paylines.\nThe bonus is triggered when there is a payout on all eight paylines with the fire or water tiger. In this case, the game triggers the Bonus Tigers, a nine-spin game. A series of symbols remain on the reel.\nBy drawing the type of opposite tiger on the remaining fields, the yin-yang symbol stops at that position. Completing the nine spins results in a cash prize paid for the number of yin-yang symbols.\nIn this regard, one symbol pays 20x, two pay 25x, three pay 30x, and so on, with a maximum win of 1000x times the bet for all nine symbols.\nAnother unique feature is that 9 Tigers return the bet even for the smallest win, which is a payline. In case three matching symbols stop on a single line, the player gets back 1.8x the bet. Two paylines pay 2.8x, three pay 3.8x. The optimal grant is with six and seven paylines: 16.8x on the bet.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDiscover the Far Eastern-themed slot machine called Golden Tiger.

Regardless of the bet amount, the game plays on all available paylines.\nThe bonus is triggered when there is a payout on all eight paylines with the fire or water tiger. In this case, the game triggers the Bonus Tigers, a nine-spin game. A series of symbols remain on the reel.\nBy drawing the type of opposite tiger on the remaining fields, the yin-yang symbol stops at that position. Completing the nine spins results in a cash prize paid for the number of yin-yang symbols.\nIn this regard, one symbol pays 20x, two pay 25x, three pay 30x, and so on, with a maximum win of 1000x times the bet for all nine symbols.\nAnother unique feature is that 9 Tigers return the bet even for the smallest win, which is a payline. In case three matching symbols stop on a single line, the player gets back 1.8x the bet. Two paylines pay 2.8x, three pay 3.8x.

While it may seem simple, Wazdan has given 9 Tigers its own life. Players can win prizes of over 1000x their bet from a single spin.\n9 Tigers is a game that seems to have been designed for the Asian market. It features Yin and Yang elements, Fire and Water, in the form of elemental tigers. A classic-looking slot, it can incorporate modern graphics and features.\nThe 3x3 reels spin with a total of 9 Tigers on them. Combinations will form on 8 lines, paying up to 1,000x the stake. There is only one real feature, the Tiger Bonus, which has two sides, Fire and Water, each of which works a little differently. Expect a game with an RTP of 96.19%, so it's the kind you would consider just right.\nAn Oriental-themed Graphics\nThe tigers have this ethereal glow around them and seem ready to leap, and they do so when a win is obtained. On one hand, you would want there to be more than one animal in the game, but then the game just requires two kinds of symbols.\nEach win is marked energetically in an electric light display around the symbols and across the paylines. An Oriental theme musical score fits very well with the game's theme and environment.\nThe Oriental theme is clear here, and it is also very well designed. You get two Tigers designed as Fire and Water elements, opposite sides. The Yin and Yang aspect is strong here, and is part of the two symbols that will appear on the reels. That's all for the symbol list, so you could say it's not a typical slot machine by any means. Overall, I like the look of the game, but apart from the number of reels, don't mistake it for a classic.\nThe game features only two symbols and one bonus symbol. The name 9 Tigers refers to the number of symbols that can land on the reel-set, which has three reels and three rows. The number of paylines is eight, and not every spin will fill every position with both or either of these symbols.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nYou can sit in the temple, hidden somewhere in mythical Shaolin, by pressing the rotation button. The yin-yang symbol is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. On both the left and right sides of this button are buttons relevant to gameplay.\nWazdan is one of the few companies that allow players to select the variance of the random number generator. By pressing the chart symbol to the left of Spin, you can choose between low, medium, and high variance.\nOn the right, there is a button that allows you to choose the speed at which the game rotates. The available options are turtle, hare, and horse. You can imagine how each setting is reflected on the reels.\nBelow this button, 9 Tigers slot has an autoplay button (where available). Pressing this button opens the menu that allows you to choose from the number of automatic spins available. Further options are controls that allow you to have greater control over balance spending.\nLast but not least, bets can be selected from the bar below the reel-set. The smallest bet allowed is 20 credits, which is €0.20 per spin. 100 credits correspond to a bet of €1.00. The biggest bet is €100.00 per spin. Regardless of the bet amount, the game plays on all available paylines.\nThe bonus is triggered when there is a payout on all eight paylines with the fire or water tiger.
