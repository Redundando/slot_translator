The theme of this slot machine is easy to guess: we’ll be accompanied by the animals that populate a dense and dark jungle in a fun experience that finds its strength in the gameplay, more than in the graphics.\n\nAs far as the graphics are concerned, there is nothing exceptional to report: the initial screen opens with an image of the jungle that stands out with an elephant, a lion, a tiger, and a crocodile, while the game screen only consists of reels (and you’ll see that there are plenty of them!) immersed in the shadow of the vegetation.\n\nBut it’s not the graphics that attract players to Lucky Jungle. If you want to practice the gameplay, which is undoubtedly very complex, you can try the slot machine in completely free demo mode, without spending a penny or registering with any platform.\n\nThe gameplay is undoubtedly what makes this Skywind Group slot machine so original and exciting! As soon as the game screen opens, you will surely feel a moment of disorientation, because you won't find the usual grid, but a complex system of icons and boxes. More than a slot machine, Lucky Jungle seems to resemble a roulette, on which 26 symbols are reproduced forming a sort of frame around the main grid, consisting of five reels and three rows.\n\nBefore playing, you need to bet, with a range from one cent to a maximum of 20 € per round. Once you have selected the value of your bet, you need to select one or more symbols to bet on. If you choose to bet on, for example, 0.50, the value of this bet will be multiplied by the number of selected symbols.\n\nWhen the game is started, you have to wait 30 seconds before seeing the light of the slot machine flashing around the 26 symbols: if the light stops on the animal you chose, you win!\n\nLucky Jungle is a truly special slot machine with some extra features that increase the fun and the possibility of taking home rich prizes. For example, if the light stops on the Double Chance symbol, you will see the light duplicate and travel on both sides of the frame! At this point, you have a double chance of winning if both lights stop on one or more symbols that you have chosen!",

The theme of this slot machine is easy to guess: we’ll be accompanied by the animals that populate a dense and dark jungle in a fun experience that finds its strength in the gameplay, more than in the graphics.\n\nAs far as the graphics are concerned, there is nothing exceptional to report: the initial screen opens with an image of the jungle that stands out with an elephant, a lion, a tiger, and a crocodile, while the game screen only consists of reels (and you’ll see that there are plenty of them!) immersed in the shadow of the vegetation.\n\nBut it’s not the graphics that attract players to Lucky Jungle. If you want to practice the gameplay, which is undoubtedly very complex, you can try the slot machine in completely free demo mode, without spending a penny or registering with any platform.\n\nThe gameplay is undoubtedly what makes this Skywind Group slot machine so original and exciting! As soon as the game screen opens, you will surely feel a moment of disorientation, because you won't find the usual grid, but a complex system of icons and boxes. More than a slot machine, Lucky Jungle seems to resemble a roulette, on which 26 symbols are reproduced forming a sort of frame around the main grid, consisting of five reels and three rows.\n\nBefore playing, you need to bet, with a range from one cent to a maximum of 20 € per round. Once you have selected the value of your bet, you need to select one or more symbols to bet on. If you choose to bet on, for example, 0.50, the value of this bet will be multiplied by the number of selected symbols.\n\nWhen the game is started, you have to wait 30 seconds before seeing the light of the slot machine flashing around the 26 symbols: if the light stops on the animal you chose, you win!\n\nLucky Jungle is a truly special slot machine with some extra features that increase the fun and the possibility of taking home rich prizes. For example, if the light stops on the Double Chance symbol, you will see the light duplicate and travel on both sides of the frame! At this point, you have a double chance of winning if both lights stop on one or more symbols that you have chosen!\n            ",
