The Santa's Sleigh feature can be randomly activated at the beginning of any spin in the base game.

It’s no wonder he’s so...well, fat. Push Gaming has released a game that tells this Christmas story and it’s called Fat Santa slots. In it, you will be presented with all the festive features such as Santa's Village, his sleigh and many more! Keep reading to discover everything about this fantastic slot!\n\nFestive Graphics\nFat Santa is a five-reel slot with five rows and fifty fixed paylines; the action takes place in Santa's Village, where snow falls gently on the cabins and trees to create the perfect winter setting. A relaxing festive soundtrack will satisfy our ears throughout our gaming sessions.\nThe four high-value symbols are an elf, a reindeer, a snowman, and a gift; the lower values are made up of Christmas tree baubles in red, orange, and two shades of green.\nSanta himself is wild and replaces all other symbols to help form winning combos. There is also a wild cake with the same capabilities.\nThe control panel in Fat Santa slots is pretty standard and offers all the usual options like Paytables, Total Bet, and Autoplay, where you can set up to 100 automatic spins, with loss and single-win limits. After setting the bet, just press the Spin button and start your Christmas adventure.\nFat Santa slots is a simple but fun interpretation of Christmas-themed slot games. The images are cheerful without being too schmaltzy, and the catchy soundtrack adds a touch of joy to the festive atmosphere. Overall, it's a nice slot to play on these cold winter evenings, even just to get into the feel of the season.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nPay attention to Santa Claus flying in his sleigh, because it's one of the best moments to hit mega wins in the base game. Santa's Sleigh feature can be randomly triggered at the beginning of any spin in the base game. Once activated, you'll see Santa elegantly driving his sleigh full of Christmas cakes across the screen and dropping a random number on the game grid. Each position where they land will turn into a wild symbol for the testacoda to provide more chances to hit big multiline wins.\nYou can easily access the paytable on this slot and see the payouts for all symbols, but we'll mention them here too. Starting with the lowest paying symbols, you have the light green and dark green baubles that are worth 1.60 times your stake for five on a payline. Then there are the orange and red baubles, which award 2x for the five combination. Then there's the gift that pays 6 times your total bet for landing five, followed by the snowman that gives you 10x for the five-symbol combination. The adorable reindeer is worth 16 times your bet for five; the elf and Santa Claus are the highest value symbols with a payout of 20x for the five-of-a-kind combination.\nWhy do you think Santa Claus is so fat? Because of the cakes, of course! He simply adores them, and if you land him on the reels together with at least one wild cake, you activate the Fat Santa slots Free Spins feature. You initially receive five free spins, but be sure to keep an eye on the counter on the right-hand side.\nSanta Claus remains on the reels during spins, and every time a cake lands, he rushes to eat it - each consumed cake is then marked on the counter. When the cake part of the counter is full, Santa Claus increases in size and awards three extra spins. The bigger Santa Claus still counts as wild and will help you win more often.\nTo the left of the reels, there is a red button showing a value of 80 times your stake - this is the price of purchasing free spins if you want to dive right in.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nWe can offer you a thousand other Christmas-themed slot machines. If we had to name one, we would say Secrets of Christmas, the famous slot machine produced by NetEnt. This provider never disappoints and in this case, it offers an incredible RTP of 96.72%.\n            ",

Santa's Sleigh feature can be triggered at any moment during gameplay, which is a bit like being woken up by reindeer hooves on your roof in the middle of the night. Only better, because instead of an oversized man in a red suit, Santa will be dropping wild symbols all over your reels for more chances at those coveted winning combinations. It's what we call a Christmas miracle, people.</p><p>But wait, there's more! To activate the game's free spins feature, all you need to do is land Santa and at least one wild cake on your reels. This will reward you with not one, not two, but five initial free spins. And the best part? Santa himself stays on the reels during free spins, eating any cakes that appear and racking up even more free spin opportunities for you.</p><p>We know what you're thinking - how can this get any better? Well, when Santa grows in size, which is not an uncommon occurrence after a few too many wild cakes (we don't blame him), he'll award you with three extra spins. Plus, for those of you who just can't get enough of sweet ol' St. Nick, there's an option to purchase free spins for 80 times your stake by using the red button on the left side of your reels. We don't know about you, but we'd pay 80 times our weight in gingerbread cookies for a chance at those rewards.</p><p>All in all, Fat Santa offers players a sleigh-load of opportunities to increase their winnings, making this game a festive favorite for all slot enthusiasts out there. So grab yourself a cup of cocoa, snuggle up by the fireplace, and take this game for a spin. Who knows, maybe Santa will drop a little something extra for you along the way.</p>"

Santa's Sleigh feature can be triggered at any moment during gameplay, which is a bit like being woken up by reindeer hooves on your roof in the middle of the night. Only better, because instead of an oversized man in a red suit, Santa will be dropping wild symbols all over your reels for more chances at those coveted winning combinations. It's what we call a Christmas miracle, people.</p><p>But wait, there's more! To activate the game's free spins feature, all you need to do is land Santa and at least one wild cake on your reels. This will reward you with not one, not two, but five initial free spins. And the best part? Santa himself stays on the reels during free spins, eating any cakes that appear and racking up even more free spin opportunities for you.</p><p>We know what you're thinking - how can this get any better? Well, when Santa grows in size, which is not an uncommon occurrence after a few too many wild cakes (we don't blame him), he'll award you with three extra spins. Plus, for those of you who just can't get enough of sweet ol' St. Nick, there's an option to purchase free spins for 80 times your stake by using the red button on the left side of your reels. We don't know about you, but we'd pay 80 times our weight in gingerbread cookies for a chance at those rewards.</p><p>All in all, Fat Santa offers players a sleigh-load of opportunities to increase their winnings, making this game a festive favorite for all slot enthusiasts out there. So grab yourself a cup of cocoa, snuggle up by the fireplace, and take this game for a spin. Who knows, maybe Santa will drop a little something extra for you along the way.</p>\"}"

It’s no wonder he’s so...well, fat. Push Gaming has released a game that tells this Christmas story and it’s called Fat Santa slots. In it, you will be presented with all the festive features such as Santa's Village, his sleigh and many more! Keep reading to discover everything about this fantastic slot!\n\nFestive Graphics\nFat Santa is a five-reel slot with five rows and fifty fixed paylines; the action takes place in Santa's Village, where snow falls gently on the cabins and trees to create the perfect winter setting. A relaxing festive soundtrack will satisfy our ears throughout our gaming sessions.\nThe four high-value symbols are an elf, a reindeer, a snowman, and a gift; the lower values are made up of Christmas tree baubles in red, orange, and two shades of green.\nSanta himself is wild and replaces all other symbols to help form winning combos. There is also a wild cake with the same capabilities.\nThe control panel in Fat Santa slots is pretty standard and offers all the usual options like Paytables, Total Bet, and Autoplay, where you can set up to 100 automatic spins, with loss and single-win limits. After setting the bet, just press the Spin button and start your Christmas adventure.\nFat Santa slots is a simple but fun interpretation of Christmas-themed slot games. The images are cheerful without being too schmaltzy, and the catchy soundtrack adds a touch of joy to the festive atmosphere. Overall, it's a nice slot to play on these cold winter evenings, even just to get into the feel of the season.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nPay attention to Santa Claus flying in his sleigh, because it's one of the best moments to hit mega wins in the base game. Santa's Sleigh feature can be randomly triggered at the beginning of any spin in the base game. Once activated, you'll see Santa elegantly driving his sleigh full of Christmas cakes across the screen and dropping a random number on the game grid. Each position where they land will turn into a wild symbol for the testacoda to provide more chances to hit big multiline wins.\nYou can easily access the paytable on this slot and see the payouts for all symbols, but we'll mention them here too. Starting with the lowest paying symbols, you have the light green and dark green baubles that are worth 1.60 times your stake for five on a payline. Then there are the orange and red baubles, which award 2x for the five combination. Then there's the gift that pays 6 times your total bet for landing five, followed by the snowman that gives you 10x for the five-symbol combination. The adorable reindeer is worth 16 times your bet for five; the elf and Santa Claus are the highest value symbols with a payout of 20x for the five-of-a-kind combination.\nWhy do you think Santa Claus is so fat? Because of the cakes, of course! He simply adores them, and if you land him on the reels together with at least one wild cake, you activate the Fat Santa slots Free Spins feature. You initially receive five free spins, but be sure to keep an eye on the counter on the right-hand side.\nSanta Claus remains on the reels during spins, and every time a cake lands, he rushes to eat it - each consumed cake is then marked on the counter. When the cake part of the counter is full, Santa Claus increases in size and awards three extra spins. The bigger Santa Claus still counts as wild and will help you win more often.\nTo the left of the reels, there is a red button showing a value of 80 times your stake - this is the price of purchasing free spins if you want to dive right in.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nWe can offer you a thousand other Christmas-themed slot machines.
