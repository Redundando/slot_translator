    "original_text": "\nHot Hot Fruit\nIl tema frutta è forse il più utilizzato in assoluto per le slot e questo molto spesso si traduce in giochi sempre uguali con minimi cambiamenti nella grafica o nella scelta dei simboli utilizzati. Hot Hot Fruit mantiene i simboli  classici delle slot fruttate ma offre un gameplay che si discosta da tutte le altre, grazie ai simboli a trasformazione che a ogni giro moltiplicano le vincite. Partiamo però dalla grafica, altro punto di forza di questa slot. La Habanero ci ha abituato a prodotti con una grafica spettacolare e non ha di certo perso questa abitudine quando ha sviluppato Hot Hot Fruit: i simboli  della frutta sono in 3D, sembrano reali al punto che vien quasi voglia di afferrali e di assaggiarli, le animazioni sono fluide e per nulla pacchiane, i colori vivaci. Sotto la griglia di gioco sono presenti tutte le impostazioni per settare al meglio la nostra scommessa. Si può scegliere un livello compreso tra 1 e 10 che ha la funzione di moltiplicatore per la puntata totale, c’è il tasto per impostare la puntata massima con un solo click e quello per far partire i giri automatici. Un riquadro sulla sinistra ci informa sul nostro saldo residuo.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot\nMolte slot prodotte dalla Habanero hanno griglie più grandi della norma, in questo caso però si è scelto di puntare su una classica 5X3. Le linee di gioco sono 15 fisse e le scommesse vanno da 0,01 € fino a 20 € per linea. Ciò significa che puntando il minimo previsto, ogni Spin viene a costare 0,15 € e questo rende Hot Hot Fruit attraente anche per chi non ha intenzione di investire un capitale nel gioco. Questa slot ha un buon RTP del 96,84% e una volatilità media. È possibile impostare tra i 10 e i 500 giri automatici. La slot prevede inoltre un Jackpot a tempo, il cui valore viene riportato in alto sulla schermata di gioco.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nIn Hot Hot Fruit sono presenti simboli con valore basso e alto: i primi sono rappresentati dai tre frutti, anguria, arancia e prugna, i secondi dalla scritta Bar e dal numero 7. A ogni giro e in modo del tutto casuale può attivarsi però la funzione Hot Hot: tutti i simboli si trasformano (la frutta apparirà tagliata a fette, la scritta Bar verrà raddoppiata così come quella Wild) e il loro valore raddoppierà. Il simbolo 7 invece verrà triplicato e il valore moltiplicato per 3.\nIl simbolo Wild è rappresentato dalla scritta omonima, appare solo sui rulli 1, 2, 4 e 5 e non assegna vincite. Con 3 simboli Wild o doppio Wild che appaiono da sinistra a destra o da destra a sinistra sui rulli 1 e 2 o sui rulli 4 e 5, si avrà diritto a 6 giri gratuiti. Con 3 simboli Wild o doppio Wild che appaiono da sinistra a destra e da destra a sinistra sui rulli 1 e 2  e sui rulli 4 e 5, si avrà diritto a 12 giri gratuiti. Durante i Free Spins i simboli vincenti rimarranno sui rulli durante tutto il gioco bonus.\n",

            "response": "Hot Hot Fruit\nThe fruit theme is perhaps the most used in slot games, and this often results in games that are always the same, with minimal changes in graphics or choice of symbols used. However, Hot Hot Fruit maintains classic fruit slot symbols while offering gameplay that stands out from all others, thanks to transformation symbols that multiply winnings with each spin. Let's start with the graphics, another strong point of this slot. Habanero has accustomed us to products with spectacular graphics and has certainly not lost this habit when developing Hot Hot Fruit: 3D fruit symbols look so real that you almost want to grab them and taste them, animations are smooth and not at all cheesy, and the colors are bright. Under the game grid, there are all the settings to best set our bet. You can choose a level between 1 and 10, which serves as a multiplier for the total bet, there is a button to set the maximum bet with a single click, and one to start automatic spins. A box on the left informs us of our remaining balance.\n\nMain features of the slot\nMany slots produced by Habanero have larger than normal grids, but in this case, they chose to focus on a classic 5X3. The paylines are 15 fixed and bets range from €0.01 up to €20 per line. This means that by betting the minimum, every spin costs €0.15, making Hot Hot Fruit attractive to those who do not intend to invest a fortune in the game. This slot has a good RTP of 96.84% and medium volatility. You can set between 10 and 500 automatic spins. The slot also features a timed jackpot, with its value displayed at the top of the game screen.\n\nSymbols and features\nHot Hot Fruit has symbols with low and high values: the first are represented by three fruits, watermelon, orange, and plum, while the second consists of the word Bar and the number 7. However, during each spin, the Hot Hot function can randomly activate: all symbols will transform (fruit will appear sliced, Bar will be doubled and so will the Wild), and their value will double. The 7 symbol will instead be tripled and its value multiplied by 3.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by the word itself, which only appears on reels 1, 2, 4, and 5 and does not give payouts. With 3 Wild or Double Wild symbols appearing from left to right or right to left on reels 1 and 2 or reels 4 and 5, you will be entitled to 6 free spins. With 3 Wild or Double Wild symbols appearing from left to right and right to left on reels 1 and 2 and reels 4 and 5, you will be entitled to 12 free spins.

Hot Hot Fruit maintains the classic fruit symbols of slot games, but offers gameplay that sets it apart from all others with transformation symbols that multiply winnings with each spin. Let's start with the graphics, another strong point of this slot game. Habanero has accustomed us to products with spectacular graphics and has certainly not lost this habit when developing Hot Hot Fruit: the fruit symbols are in 3D, they look so real that you almost want to grab and taste them, the animations are smooth and not tacky, the colors are vivid. Below the game grid are all the settings to set our bet to the best. You can choose a level between 1 and 10 which serves as a multiplier for the total bet, there is a button to set the maximum bet with one click and one to start automatic spins. A box on the left informs us of our remaining balance.\n\nMain features of the slot game\nMany slots produced by Habanero have larger than normal game grids, but in this case, they chose to focus on a classic 5x3. There are 15 fixed paylines and bets range from €0.01 to €20 per line. This means that by betting the minimum, each spin costs €0.15, making Hot Hot Fruit attractive even to those who do not intend to invest a lot of money in the game. This slot has a good RTP of 96.84% and medium volatility. You can set between 10 and 500 automatic spins. The slot game also has a timed jackpot, the value of which is displayed at the top of the game screen.\n\nSymbols and functionality\nHot Hot Fruit has low and high-value symbols: the former are represented by the three fruits, watermelon, orange, and plum, and the latter by the Bar sign and the number 7. However, on every spin and randomly, the Hot Hot feature can activate: all symbols transform (the fruit will appear sliced, the Bar sign will be doubled as well as the Wild symbol) and their value will double. The 7 symbol, on the other hand, will be tripled, and its value will be multiplied by 3.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by the word \"Wild\", appears only on reels 1, 2, 4, and 5, and does not award winnings. With 3 Wild or double Wild symbols that appear from left to right or right to left on reels 1 and 2 or on reels 4 and 5, you are entitled to 6 free spins. With 3 Wild or double Wild symbols that appear from left to right and right to left on reels 1 and 2 and on reels 4 and 5, you are entitled to 12 free spins. During Free Spins, winning symbols remain on the reels throughout the bonus game.\n            ",

The Hot Hot feature randomly activates transforming all symbols and doubling their value. The 7 symbol is tripled, and its value is multiplied by 3. The Wild symbol appears on reels 1, 2, 4, and 5, and does not award winnings. With 3 Wild or double Wild symbols that appear from left to right or right to left on reels 1 and 2 or on reels 4 and 5, you are entitled to 6 free spins. With 3 Wild or double Wild symbols that appear from left to right and right to left on reels 1 and 2 and on reels 4 and 5, you are entitled to 12 free spins. During Free Spins, winning symbols remain on the reels throughout the bonus game.\n\nGraphics and 3D Fruit Symbols\n\nHabanero did not disappoint when developing Hot Hot Fruit as the fruit symbols are in 3D, look so real that you almost want to grab and taste them, and the animations are smooth and not tacky. The colors are vivid and the graphics are spectacular.\n\nClassic Game Grid and Paylines\n\nHot Hot Fruit has a classic 5x3 game grid with 15 fixed paylines. The bets range from €0.01 to €20 per line. This means that each spin costs €0.15 when betting the minimum, making Hot Hot Fruit attractive even to those who do not intend to invest a lot of money in the game.\n\nBets and Accessibility\n\nHot Hot Fruit allows players to choose a level between 1 and 10 which serves as a multiplier for the total bet. There is a button to set the maximum bet with one click and one to start automatic spins. A box on the left informs players of their remaining balance. The game is accessible to players who do not want to invest a lot of money as the minimum bet is €0.15.\n\nRTP, Volatility, and Chances of Winning\n\nHot Hot Fruit has a good RTP of 96.84% and medium volatility. The timed jackpot value is displayed at the top of the game screen. With the Hot Hot feature randomly activating during spins, players have the chance to multiply their winnings. The Wild symbol also awards free spins, with 3 Wild or double Wild symbols entitling players to 6 free spins, and 3 Wild or double Wild symbols from left to right and right to left on reels 1 and 2 and on reels 4 and 5 entitling players to 12 free spins. Overall, the game offers players a good chance of winning.\n\n        \n            ",

Hot Hot Fruit maintains the classic fruit symbols of slot games, but offers gameplay that sets it apart from all others with transformation symbols that multiply winnings with each spin. Let's start with the graphics, another strong point of this slot game. Habanero has accustomed us to products with spectacular graphics and has certainly not lost this habit when developing Hot Hot Fruit: the fruit symbols are in 3D, they look so real that you almost want to grab and taste them, the animations are smooth and not tacky, the colors are vivid. Below the game grid are all the settings to set our bet to the best. You can choose a level between 1 and 10 which serves as a multiplier for the total bet, there is a button to set the maximum bet with one click and one to start automatic spins. A box on the left informs us of our remaining balance.\n\nMain features of the slot game\nMany slots produced by Habanero have larger than normal game grids, but in this case, they chose to focus on a classic 5x3. There are 15 fixed paylines and bets range from €0.01 to €20 per line. This means that by betting the minimum, each spin costs €0.15, making Hot Hot Fruit attractive even to those who do not intend to invest a lot of money in the game. This slot has a good RTP of 96.84% and medium volatility. You can set between 10 and 500 automatic spins. The slot game also has a timed jackpot, the value of which is displayed at the top of the game screen.\n\nSymbols and functionality\nHot Hot Fruit has low and high-value symbols: the former are represented by the three fruits, watermelon, orange, and plum, and the latter by the Bar sign and the number 7. However, on every spin and randomly, the Hot Hot feature can activate: all symbols transform (the fruit will appear sliced, the Bar sign will be doubled as well as the Wild symbol) and their value will double. The 7 symbol, on the other hand, will be tripled, and its value will be multiplied by 3.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by the word \"Wild\", appears only on reels 1, 2, 4, and 5, and does not award winnings. With 3 Wild or double Wild symbols that appear from left to right or right to left on reels 1 and 2 or on reels 4 and 5, you are entitled to 6 free spins.

Hot Hot Fruit maintains the classic fruit symbols of slot games, but offers gameplay that sets it apart from all others with transformation symbols that multiply winnings with each spin. Let's start with the graphics, another strong point of this slot game. Habanero has accustomed us to products with spectacular graphics and has certainly not lost this habit when developing Hot Hot Fruit: the fruit symbols are in 3D, they look so real that you almost want to grab and taste them, the animations are smooth and not tacky, the colors are vivid. Below the game grid are all the settings to set our bet to the best. You can choose a level between 1 and 10 which serves as a multiplier for the total bet, there is a button to set the maximum bet with one click and one to start automatic spins. A box on the left informs us of our remaining balance.\n\nMain features of the slot game\nMany slots produced by Habanero have larger than normal game grids, but in this case, they chose to focus on a classic 5x3. There are 15 fixed paylines and bets range from €0.01 to €20 per line. This means that by betting the minimum, each spin costs €0.15, making Hot Hot Fruit attractive even to those who do not intend to invest a lot of money in the game. This slot has a good RTP of 96.84% and medium volatility. You can set between 10 and 500 automatic spins. The slot game also has a timed jackpot, the value of which is displayed at the top of the game screen.\n\nSymbols and functionality\nHot Hot Fruit has low and high-value symbols: the former are represented by the three fruits, watermelon, orange, and plum, and the latter by the Bar sign and the number 7. However, on every spin and randomly, the Hot Hot feature can activate: all symbols transform (the fruit will appear sliced, the Bar sign will be doubled as well as the Wild symbol) and their value will double. The 7 symbol, on the other hand, will be tripled, and its value will be multiplied by 3.\n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by the word \"Wild\", appears only on reels 1, 2, 4, and 5, and does not award winnings. With 3 Wild or double Wild symbols that appear from left to right or right to left on reels 1 and 2 or on reels 4 and 5, you are entitled to 6 free spins. With 3 Wild or double Wild symbols that appear from left to right and right to left on reels 1 and 2 and on reels 4 and 5, you are entitled to 12 free spins. During Free Spins, winning symbols remain on the reels throughout the bonus game.\n        ",
