There were also controversies over the second slot in the series, Aztec Treasure, when it was revealed that the slot was not entirely original but was a kind of mix between the classic Interactive Montezuma's Treasure and a kind of homemade prototype on the Megaways engine.\nAs for this latest chapter in the series, explorer John Hunter finds himself no less than among the pyramids of Giza: the game features 5 reels and 25 paylines and is enriched by the possibility of obtaining various free spins and multipliers up to x25.\nSymbols, Wilds and Scatters\nThe background of John Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen is a desert environment with the great pyramids flanking the reels, and even the symbols with the highest value are themed to Ancient Egypt like the Book of Ra slot. Among these, as far as regular symbols are concerned, we find a leather bag, a gun in a holster, the explorer John Hunter, and the deity Anobi. Queen Cleopatra is the Wild of this slot machine and can replace all other symbols, except the Scatter, to achieve a winning combination. The Scatter is instead represented by the majestic pyramid and allows access to free spins, where you can also take advantage of various multipliers.\nIn addition to the themed symbols, we also find the cards from the J to the Ace.\nJohn Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen: conclusions\nOf the three slot machines in the Hunter explorer saga, this is the most successful: it is first and foremost an original slot, the jackpot is high but not entirely improbable like that of the first chapter in the series, and the linear gameplay is enriched with special features that make the game quite enjoyable.\nYou can play John Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen both from desktop computers and mobile devices in various online casinos, betting from €0.20 up to €125 per spin.\nFinally, the Egyptian-inspired soundtrack and well-crafted graphics will make for an enjoyable gaming experience!\n        ",
