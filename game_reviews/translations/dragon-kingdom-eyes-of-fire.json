Due draghi di differenti colori che si trovano all’interno di una grotta fanno la guardia a un tesoro inestimabile, ma soprattutto alle loro preziose uova. La griglia di gioco è incorniciata nel marmo, accanto c’è un ulteriore rullo in cui compaiono tre diverse uova a cui è associato un moltiplicatore.

Per quel che riguarda il comparto sonoro, abbiamo una musica epica che si accompagna al suono meccanico della rotazione dei rulli.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia è di forma quadrata, con 3 rulli e 3 righe. Le linee di pagamento sono 5 e fisse, con una puntata minima totale di appena 0,5 € per spin, caratteristica che rende questa slot adatta anche per i principianti. Si vince con simboli identici adiacenti da sinistra a destra e viene pagata solo la vincita più alta per linea. Si possono impostare da 10 a 1.000 giri automatici e due opzioni di velocità, veloce e turbo.

Si parte con il livello 1, ma con 4 giri non vincenti si aggiunge un altro rullo speciale in cui sono presenti 3 uova. Su questo rullo appaiono solo moltiplicatori di vincita, e ad ogni spin uno di essi verrà incorniciato, rivelando il moltiplicatore che si applicherà a tutta la vincita. Mettiamo però che per altri 4 giri non riusciamo a formare nessuna combinazione pagante. A questo punto si passerà al livello 2, che offre moltiplicatori 2x, 3x e 5x. Se passano altri 9 Spin senza combinazioni vincenti, allora si salirà al livello 3 e avremo moltiplicatori 3x, 5x e 8x.

Two dragons of different colors guard an invaluable treasure, but above all, their precious eggs, within a cave. The game grid is framed in marble, and there is an additional reel next to it that features three different eggs with a multiplier associated with them. At the top, there is a cauldron filled with a purple potion, and at the bottom, there are buttons to play and access the internal menu.

In Dragon Kingdom – Eyes of Fire, these powerful animals are appropriately celebrated in a beautiful slot game with stunning graphics, and it's delightful to play thanks to its ease of use. Two dragons of different colors guard an invaluable treasure, but above all, their precious eggs, within a cave. The game grid is framed in marble, and there is an additional reel next to it that features three different eggs with a multiplier associated with them. At the top, there is a cauldron filled with a purple potion, and at the bottom, there are buttons to play and access the internal menu. As for the sound, we have epic music that accompanies the mechanical sound of the reels' rotation.\n\nSlot Features\n\nThe grid is square-shaped with 3 reels and 3 rows. There are 5 fixed paylines, with a total minimum bet of just €0.5 per spin, making it suitable even for beginners. Winning combinations occur with adjacent identical symbols from left to right, and only the highest winning per line is paid. Automatic spins can be set from 10 to 1,000, and there are two speed options: fast and turbo. Low volatility is a feature that results in frequent but low winnings, and an RTP value of 96.49%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nTo win, we need a combination of only 3 symbols. The lowest value symbols are the 4 playing card suits, and as we climb up, we find the fiery number seven, the red dragon, and the blue dragon. The Wild symbol is represented by the dragon's eye and replaces all symbols.\n\nA unique feature of Dragon Kingdom – Eyes of Fire is the progressive game level. It starts at level 1, but with 4 non-winning spins, another special reel with 3 eggs appears. Only win multipliers appear on this reel, and with each spin, one of them will be framed, revealing the multiplier that will apply to the entire win. However, let's say that for another 4 spins, we are unable to form any paying combination. At this point, we will move up to level 2, which offers 2x, 3x, and 5x multipliers. If another 9 spins pass without a winning combination, we will move up to level 3, with 3x, 5x, and 8x multipliers. As we continue to lose, we move up to higher levels, up to level 6, which offers a maximum multiplier of 50x. When the first winning spin occurs, the special reel deactivates, and we start again.\n\nExperience the thrill of Dragon Kingdom – Eyes of Fire and let its fantastic features lead you to exceptional wins!\n            ",

In Dragon Kingdom – Eyes of Fire, these powerful animals are appropriately celebrated in a beautiful slot game with stunning graphics, and it's delightful to play thanks to its ease of use. Two dragons of different colors guard an invaluable treasure, but above all, their precious eggs, within a cave. The game grid is framed in marble, and there is an additional reel next to it that features three different eggs with a multiplier associated with them. At the top, there is a cauldron filled with a purple potion, and at the bottom, there are buttons to play and access the internal menu. As for the sound, we have epic music that accompanies the mechanical sound of the reels' rotation.\n\nSlot Features\n\nThe grid is square-shaped with 3 reels and 3 rows. There are 5 fixed paylines, with a total minimum bet of just €0.5 per spin, making it suitable even for beginners. Winning combinations occur with adjacent identical symbols from left to right, and only the highest winning per line is paid. Automatic spins can be set from 10 to 1,000, and there are two speed options: fast and turbo. Low volatility is a feature that results in frequent but low winnings, and an RTP value of 96.49%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nTo win, we need a combination of only 3 symbols.

It starts at level 1, but with 4 non-winning spins, another special reel with 3 eggs appears. Only win multipliers appear on this reel, and with each spin, one of them will be framed, revealing the multiplier that will apply to the entire win. However, let's say that for another 4 spins, we are unable to form any paying combination. At this point, we will move up to level 2, which offers 2x, 3x, and 5x multipliers. If another 9 spins pass without a winning combination, we will move up to level 3, with 3x, 5x, and 8x multipliers. As we continue to lose, we move up to higher levels, up to level 6, which offers a maximum multiplier of 50x. When the first winning spin occurs, the special reel deactivates, and we start again.\n\nExperience the thrill of Dragon Kingdom – Eyes of Fire and let its fantastic features lead you to exceptional wins!\n            ",

In Dragon Kingdom – Eyes of Fire, these powerful animals are appropriately celebrated in a beautiful slot game with stunning graphics, and it's delightful to play thanks to its ease of use. Two dragons of different colors guard an invaluable treasure, but above all, their precious eggs, within a cave. The game grid is framed in marble, and there is an additional reel next to it that features three different eggs with a multiplier associated with them. At the top, there is a cauldron filled with a purple potion, and at the bottom, there are buttons to play and access the internal menu. As for the sound, we have epic music that accompanies the mechanical sound of the reels' rotation.\n\nSlot Features\n\nThe grid is square-shaped with 3 reels and 3 rows. There are 5 fixed paylines, with a total minimum bet of just €0.5 per spin, making it suitable even for beginners. Winning combinations occur with adjacent identical symbols from left to right, and only the highest winning per line is paid. Automatic spins can be set from 10 to 1,000, and there are two speed options: fast and turbo. Low volatility is a feature that results in frequent but low winnings, and an RTP value of 96.49%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nTo win, we need a combination of only 3 symbols. The lowest value symbols are the 4 playing card suits, and as we climb up, we find the fiery number seven, the red dragon, and the blue dragon. The Wild symbol is represented by the dragon's eye and replaces all symbols.\n\nA unique feature of Dragon Kingdom – Eyes of Fire is the progressive game level. It starts at level 1, but with 4 non-winning spins, another special reel with 3 eggs appears. Only win multipliers appear on this reel, and with each spin, one of them will be framed, revealing the multiplier that will apply to the entire win. However, let's say that for another 4 spins, we are unable to form any paying combination. At this point, we will move up to level 2, which offers 2x, 3x, and 5x multipliers. If another 9 spins pass without a winning combination, we will move up to level 3, with 3x, 5x, and 8x multipliers. As we continue to lose, we move up to higher levels, up to level 6, which offers a maximum multiplier of 50x. When the first winning spin occurs, the special reel deactivates, and we start again.\n\nExperience the thrill of Dragon Kingdom – Eyes of Fire and let its fantastic features lead you to exceptional wins!\n        ",
