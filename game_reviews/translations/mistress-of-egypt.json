Begin your adventure with just 60 cents per spin and play for your chance to win the symbolic prizes of the base game, as well as the bonus feature that comes with free spins. The game has a theoretical RTP of 96.20%.\nTravel back to ancient Egypt with the IGT slot game. Mistress of Egypt is the first in a series of progressive jackpot slots. Explore the pyramids in search of hidden treasures with synchronized reels, random wilds, and a free spin feature that can lead to wins up to 200 times your bet on every single spin. And let's not forget about the three progressive jackpots with potentially life-changing payouts.\nThe graphics of this game feature an Ancient Egyptian theme, but with a unique twist. Unlike most Egyptian-themed slots, this game doesn't feature pyramids, secret chambers, oases, or sphinxes as part of the background. Instead, we have Mistress of Egypt herself, to the left of the reels, holding a pyramid-shaped device, with a blue sky background displayed from inside a palace room.\nThe soundtrack for the action on the reels of Mistress of Egypt is a hypnotic Middle Eastern melody with ambient tones that set the atmosphere for gameplay. It's entertaining and doesn't make you want to turn it off, but if you prefer to play in complete silence or with the casino's soundtrack, the menu offers the option to do so.\nMistress of Egypt is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 30 fixed paylines. Wins are awarded from two to five matching symbols on a line from left to right. Your search for hidden treasures on desktop or mobile starts at 0.60 credits and can peak at 9 credits per spin. The medium variance game comes with a base RTP of 95.60%. The total RTP, including the jackpots, is 96.20%.\nLoading the game puts you in Cleopatra's temple on a starry night with a clear sky. The empress herself stands kindly to the left with a golden pyramid in her hands. She will randomly distribute collected pyramids to the reels when the respective feature is triggered. The heavily decorated game window is flanked by two Egyptian columns, while an oriental soundtrack underscores the theme.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nStart your adventure in Ancient Egypt by hitting the spin button. This will spin the reels once, but if you want to sit back and let the game do the clicking, use the autoplay button.\nThis is the purple button with the plus sign. This will open a series of options that will allow you to set a win limit, a loss limit, and a number of automatic spins.\nTo select your bet, simply use the minus and plus buttons in the Total Bet window located under the third reel. Selecting values from the list also changes the value in the Coin Value. This immediately indicates to players what the bet per line is.\nWith a smaller bet of €0.60, the coin value is €0.01. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the maximum bet of €9.00 per spin, which is the highest multiplier that increases the value of the jackpots.\nTo see the paytable and find out what the Mistress of Egypt bonus features are and how they're triggered, you can access the paytable from the menu button. However, this is not necessary as all wins are automatically recorded.\nGame symbols are divided into higher-paying picture symbols and lower-paying high card symbols, as is typical with most online slots.\nThe first category of picture symbols includes the most famous Egyptian deities: Bastet the cat, Anubis the jackal, Osiris the falcon, and Thoth represented by an ibis, the god of wisdom.\nLand the usual best five-symbol match on a five-reel slot to win the top prizes. Picture symbols pay the best, and high card symbols support you in the game. However, it's the bonus spins that can lift you up and award a big payout, potentially leading to the Mistress of Egypt slot machine jackpot prizes.\nFor a jackpot game of this caliber, an incredibly high theoretical return to player has been given back to the player. Players will be surprised to see that this edition of the Mistress of Egypt slot has an RTP of 96.20%.\nSimilar Slot Games\nBeauty of Cleopatra is a jackpot game with a lavish 50,000x prize with five Cleopatra (the wild symbol) and a series of other symbols that pay 1000x or more. A free bonus spin feature triggered by three or more scatters is also possible, and it carries a x3 multiplier on all wins. This is a high variance slot, however, the RTP has not yet been released.",

This game is a continuation of the popular Mistress of Egypt slot game. Begin your adventure with just 60 cents per spin and play to win both the symbolic prizes in the base game as well as the bonus features that come with free spins. The game boasts a theoretical RTP of 96.20%.\n\nTravel back to ancient Egypt with the IGT slot game, Mistress of Egypt - the first of its kind with a progressive jackpot. Explore pyramids in search of hidden treasures with synchronized reels, random wilds, and a free spin round that could lead to wins of up to 200 times your bet on each spin. And don't forget about the three progressive jackpots that have potentially life-changing payouts.\n\nAlthough the graphics of this game are in the style of ancient Egypt, they're unlike anything you've seen before. Instead of pyramids, secret chambers, oases, and sphinxes as part of the background, you'll find the Mistress of Egypt standing to the left of the reels, holding a pyramid-shaped device, and a blue sky background shown from within a palace room. \n\nThe soundtrack for the reel action of Mistress of Egypt is a mesmerizing Middle Eastern melody with ambient tones that create the perfect atmosphere for gameplay. You'll have fun listening to it and won't want to turn it off, but if you prefer to play in perfect silence or with the online casino soundtrack, the menu offers that option.\n\nMistress of Egypt is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 30 fixed paylines. Wins are awarded for two to five matching symbols on a line from left to right. Your search for hidden treasures on your desktop or mobile starts at 0.60 credits and can go up to a peak of 9 credits per spin. The game has a medium variance with a base RTP of 95.60%. The total RTP, including the jackpots, is 96.20%.\n\nLoading the game will take you to Cleopatra's temple on a starry night with a clear sky. The empress herself stands gracefully on the left with a golden pyramid in her hands. She'll randomly distribute the collected pyramids to the reels when the respective feature is activated. The highly decorated game window is flanked by two Egyptian columns, and an Oriental soundtrack underscores the theme.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nStart your adventure in ancient Egypt by pressing the spin button. This will spin the reels once, but if you want to sit back and let the game do the clicking, use the autoplay button. This is the purple button with a plus sign. This will open a series of options that will allow you to set a win limit, a loss limit, and a number of automatic spins.\n\nTo select your bet, simply use the plus and minus buttons in the Total Bet window located under the third reel. By selecting values from the list, you'll also be changing the number in the Coin Value, indicating to players their bet per line. With a smaller bet of €0.60, the coin value is €0.01. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the bet of €9.00 per spin, which is the highest multiplier that can increase the value of the jackpots.\n\nTo view the paytable and to find out more about the Mistress of Egypt bonus features, including how they're activated, you can click on the menu button. However, this isn't necessary because all wins are automatically recorded.\n\nGame symbols are divided into high-paying image symbols and low-paying high cards, as is usual in most online slots. The first category of image symbols includes the most famous of Egyptian deities, such as the cat-faced goddess Bastet, the jackal-headed Anubis, the falcon-headed Osiris, and Thoth represented as an ibis, the god of wisdom.\n\nLand the usual five symbols matching on a payline to win the top prizes for a five-reel slot. The image symbols pay the best, and the high cards support you in the game. However, it's the bonus spins that can lift you up, give you a big win, and potentially lead to the Mistress of Egypt jackpot slot prizes.\n\nFor a jackpot game, this one has an incredibly high theoretical return to player. Players will be surprised to see that this edition of Mistress of Egypt has an RTP of 96.20%.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nBeauty of Cleopatra is another jackpot game with a luscious prize of 50,000x with five Cleopatras (wild symbols), and a series of other symbols that pay 1000x or more. There's also a free spins bonus triggered by three or more scatters, and it carries a x3 multiplier on all wins. This is a high variance slot, but the RTP has not yet been released."

Your search for hidden treasures on your desktop or mobile starts at 0.60 credits and can go up to a peak of 9 credits per spin. The game has a medium variance with a base RTP of 95.60%. The total RTP, including the jackpots, is 96.20%.\n\nLoading the game will take you to Cleopatra's temple on a starry night with a clear sky. The empress herself stands gracefully on the left with a golden pyramid in her hands. She'll randomly distribute the collected pyramids to the reels when the respective feature is activated. The highly decorated game window is flanked by two Egyptian columns, and an Oriental soundtrack underscores the theme.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nStart your adventure in ancient Egypt by pressing the spin button. This will spin the reels once, but if you want to sit back and let the game do the clicking, use the autoplay button. This is the purple button with a plus sign. This will open a series of options that will allow you to set a win limit, a loss limit, and a number of automatic spins.\n\nTo select your bet, simply use the plus and minus buttons in the Total Bet window located under the third reel. By selecting values from the list, you'll also be changing the number in the Coin Value, indicating to players their bet per line. With a smaller bet of €0.60, the coin value is €0.01. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the bet of €9.00 per spin, which is the highest multiplier that can increase the value of the jackpots.\n\nTo view the paytable and to find out more about the Mistress of Egypt bonus features, including how they're activated, you can click on the menu button. However, this isn't necessary because all wins are automatically recorded.\n\nGame symbols are divided into high-paying image symbols and low-paying high cards, as is usual in most online slots. The first category of image symbols includes the most famous of Egyptian deities, such as the cat-faced goddess Bastet, the jackal-headed Anubis, the falcon-headed Osiris, and Thoth represented as an ibis, the god of wisdom.\n\nLand the usual five symbols matching on a payline to win the top prizes for a five-reel slot. The image symbols pay the best, and the high cards support you in the game. However, it's the bonus spins that can lift you up, give you a big win, and potentially lead to the Mistress of Egypt jackpot slot prizes.\n\nFor a jackpot game, this one has an incredibly high theoretical return to player. Players will be surprised to see that this edition of Mistress of Egypt has an RTP of 96.20%.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nBeauty of Cleopatra is another jackpot game with a luscious prize of 50,000x with five Cleopatras (wild symbols), and a series of other symbols that pay 1000x or more. There's also a free spins bonus triggered by three or more scatters, and it carries a x3 multiplier on all wins. This is a high variance slot, but the RTP has not yet been released.\n            ",

This game is a continuation of the popular Mistress of Egypt slot game. Begin your adventure with just 60 cents per spin and play to win both the symbolic prizes in the base game as well as the bonus features that come with free spins. The game boasts a theoretical RTP of 96.20%.\n\nTravel back to ancient Egypt with the IGT slot game, Mistress of Egypt - the first of its kind with a progressive jackpot. Explore pyramids in search of hidden treasures with synchronized reels, random wilds, and a free spin round that could lead to wins of up to 200 times your bet on each spin. And don't forget about the three progressive jackpots that have potentially life-changing payouts.\n\nAlthough the graphics of this game are in the style of ancient Egypt, they're unlike anything you've seen before. Instead of pyramids, secret chambers, oases, and sphinxes as part of the background, you'll find the Mistress of Egypt standing to the left of the reels, holding a pyramid-shaped device, and a blue sky background shown from within a palace room. \n\nThe soundtrack for the reel action of Mistress of Egypt is a mesmerizing Middle Eastern melody with ambient tones that create the perfect atmosphere for gameplay.

This game is a continuation of the popular Mistress of Egypt slot game. Begin your adventure with just 60 cents per spin and play to win both the symbolic prizes in the base game as well as the bonus features that come with free spins. The game boasts a theoretical RTP of 96.20%.\n\nTravel back to ancient Egypt with the IGT slot game, Mistress of Egypt - the first of its kind with a progressive jackpot. Explore pyramids in search of hidden treasures with synchronized reels, random wilds, and a free spin round that could lead to wins of up to 200 times your bet on each spin. And don't forget about the three progressive jackpots that have potentially life-changing payouts.\n\nAlthough the graphics of this game are in the style of ancient Egypt, they're unlike anything you've seen before. Instead of pyramids, secret chambers, oases, and sphinxes as part of the background, you'll find the Mistress of Egypt standing to the left of the reels, holding a pyramid-shaped device, and a blue sky background shown from within a palace room. \n\nThe soundtrack for the reel action of Mistress of Egypt is a mesmerizing Middle Eastern melody with ambient tones that create the perfect atmosphere for gameplay. You'll have fun listening to it and won't want to turn it off, but if you prefer to play in perfect silence or with the online casino soundtrack, the menu offers that option.\n\nMistress of Egypt is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 30 fixed paylines. Wins are awarded for two to five matching symbols on a line from left to right. Your search for hidden treasures on your desktop or mobile starts at 0.60 credits and can go up to a peak of 9 credits per spin. The game has a medium variance with a base RTP of 95.60%. The total RTP, including the jackpots, is 96.20%.\n\nLoading the game will take you to Cleopatra's temple on a starry night with a clear sky. The empress herself stands gracefully on the left with a golden pyramid in her hands. She'll randomly distribute the collected pyramids to the reels when the respective feature is activated. The highly decorated game window is flanked by two Egyptian columns, and an Oriental soundtrack underscores the theme.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nStart your adventure in ancient Egypt by pressing the spin button. This will spin the reels once, but if you want to sit back and let the game do the clicking, use the autoplay button. This is the purple button with a plus sign. This will open a series of options that will allow you to set a win limit, a loss limit, and a number of automatic spins.\n\nTo select your bet, simply use the plus and minus buttons in the Total Bet window located under the third reel. By selecting values from the list, you'll also be changing the number in the Coin Value, indicating to players their bet per line. With a smaller bet of €0.60, the coin value is €0.01. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the bet of €9.00 per spin, which is the highest multiplier that can increase the value of the jackpots.\n\nTo view the paytable and to find out more about the Mistress of Egypt bonus features, including how they're activated, you can click on the menu button. However, this isn't necessary because all wins are automatically recorded.\n\nGame symbols are divided into high-paying image symbols and low-paying high cards, as is usual in most online slots. The first category of image symbols includes the most famous of Egyptian deities, such as the cat-faced goddess Bastet, the jackal-headed Anubis, the falcon-headed Osiris, and Thoth represented as an ibis, the god of wisdom.\n\nLand the usual five symbols matching on a payline to win the top prizes for a five-reel slot. The image symbols pay the best, and the high cards support you in the game. However, it's the bonus spins that can lift you up, give you a big win, and potentially lead to the Mistress of Egypt jackpot slot prizes.\n\nFor a jackpot game, this one has an incredibly high theoretical return to player. Players will be surprised to see that this edition of Mistress of Egypt has an RTP of 96.20%.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nBeauty of Cleopatra is another jackpot game with a luscious prize of 50,000x with five Cleopatras (wild symbols), and a series of other symbols that pay 1000x or more. There's also a free spins bonus triggered by three or more scatters, and it carries a x3 multiplier on all wins. This is a high variance slot, but the RTP has not yet been released.\n            ",

And don't forget about the three progressive jackpots that have potentially life-changing payouts.\n\nAlthough the graphics of this game are in the style of ancient Egypt, they're unlike anything you've seen before. Instead of pyramids, secret chambers, oases, and sphinxes as part of the background, you'll find the Mistress of Egypt standing to the left of the reels, holding a pyramid-shaped device, and a blue sky background shown from within a palace room. \n\nThe soundtrack for the reel action of Mistress of Egypt is a mesmerizing Middle Eastern melody with ambient tones that create the perfect atmosphere for gameplay. You'll have fun listening to it and won't want to turn it off, but if you prefer to play in perfect silence or with the online casino soundtrack, the menu offers that option.\n\nMistress of Egypt is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 30 fixed paylines. Wins are awarded for two to five matching symbols on a line from left to right. Your search for hidden treasures on your desktop or mobile starts at 0.60 credits and can go up to a peak of 9 credits per spin. The game has a medium variance with a base RTP of 95.60%. The total RTP, including the jackpots, is 96.20%.\n\nLoading the game will take you to Cleopatra's temple on a starry night with a clear sky. The empress herself stands gracefully on the left with a golden pyramid in her hands. She'll randomly distribute the collected pyramids to the reels when the respective feature is activated. The highly decorated game window is flanked by two Egyptian columns, and an Oriental soundtrack underscores the theme.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nStart your adventure in ancient Egypt by pressing the spin button. This will spin the reels once, but if you want to sit back and let the game do the clicking, use the autoplay button. This is the purple button with a plus sign. This will open a series of options that will allow you to set a win limit, a loss limit, and a number of automatic spins.\n\nTo select your bet, simply use the plus and minus buttons in the Total Bet window located under the third reel. By selecting values from the list, you'll also be changing the number in the Coin Value, indicating to players their bet per line. With a smaller bet of €0.60, the coin value is €0.01. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the bet of €9.00 per spin, which is the highest multiplier that can increase the value of the jackpots.\n\nTo view the paytable and to find out more about the Mistress of Egypt bonus features, including how they're activated, you can click on the menu button. However, this isn't necessary because all wins are automatically recorded.\n\nGame symbols are divided into high-paying image symbols and low-paying high cards, as is usual in most online slots. The first category of image symbols includes the most famous of Egyptian deities, such as the cat-faced goddess Bastet, the jackal-headed Anubis, the falcon-headed Osiris, and Thoth represented as an ibis, the god of wisdom.\n\nLand the usual five symbols matching on a payline to win the top prizes for a five-reel slot. The image symbols pay the best, and the high cards support you in the game. However, it's the bonus spins that can lift you up, give you a big win, and potentially lead to the Mistress of Egypt jackpot slot prizes.\n\nFor a jackpot game, this one has an incredibly high theoretical return to player. Players will be surprised to see that this edition of Mistress of Egypt has an RTP of 96.20%.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nBeauty of Cleopatra is another jackpot game with a luscious prize of 50,000x with five Cleopatras (wild symbols), and a series of other symbols that pay 1000x or more. There's also a free spins bonus triggered by three or more scatters, and it carries a x3 multiplier on all wins. This is a high variance slot, but the RTP has not yet been released.\n            ",
