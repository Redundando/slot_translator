Sweep everything away and rediscover some healthy simplicity by playing 6 Fruits, which is the epitome of a clean and basic game. Retro-style entertainment passes through Synot Games developers who love to offer retro slots. Rediscovering the naturalness of gambling through fruit-themed machines is a fun way to breathe the true essence of the game. What we find on the screen is a structure with 5 reels and three rows of symbols, for only 5 paylines. There is nothing more essential than this! You can spin and stop the reels, wait for the symbols to descend and trigger the winning of big prizes by relying on a strategy that will be functional and winning. But are there also bonus features? Continue reading our review to find answers to all your questions!\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nClean screen, devoid of any pompous ornament: 6 Fruits focuses on the game and not on its appearance. And this is how a slot that could easily recall one of the old models in casinos or bars is digitized. For graphics and soundtrack it is very reminiscent of the old school of gaming reproduced on modern platforms. What do we find? The title immediately reveals everything that the machine gives us: we have the 6 fruit symbols to match in the hope of unlocking important winnings. Six different icons that can activate multipliers on the prizes that accumulate. It is the only way that a player has to take part in profitable sessions. Combinations are formed from left to right, combining two or more identical symbols on a payline. The only symbol that triggers doubled payments is the cherry, which is also the image that offers the lowest payout. The absolute leader is the number 7 which instead awards winnings of 100 or 5,000 times the bet. The watermelons, plums, lemons and grapes are not bad either, paying from 20x and 500x the value of your bet. The star is an icon that rewards from 10 to 250 times your bet and is chosen with the role of Scatter. However, it is a somewhat anomalous Scatter compared to what modern slots show us because it offers only a monetary reward but does not unlock special functions.\n\nFinal considerations on the 6 Fruits slot\nWe have come to the end of our journey aboard 6 Fruits and we must certainly recognize one thing: it will not be a slot that will conquer all players, but it is a game that has value for those who love the style of retro casinos. It has a simple, good gameplay that could capture experienced players and not so much beginner bettors. On the other hand, newcomers may be fascinated by other types of games, graphics and animations. However, it has an incredible advantage: its RTP is solid and is set at 95.64%, which is in line with most slots that can be found online.\n            ",

The structure of 5 reels and 3 rows of symbols for only 5 paylines is not exactly groundbreaking, but sometimes, less is more. Combinations are formed from left to right, and I'd like to confirm that I did actually spell that correctly the first time. Cheers to my second-grade teacher, Mrs. Jenkins. </p><p>The cherry is, what you would call, a high achiever - the only symbol that triggers doubled payments. Kind of like that one kid in your class who always got straight A's but was also the teacher's pet. The number 7 is the symbol you're really rooting for because it offers the highest payouts of up to 5,000 times the bet. That's enough to make you sing, \\\"Oh baby, baby, it's a wild world!\\\"</p><p>The game doesn't offer any special features or bonuses, so if you were looking for a game with all the bells and whistles, you might be disappointed. But let's face it, sometimes it's best to keep things simple. And if you're clever enough to come up with a winning strategy, then you're well on your way to hitting those big prizes.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\n6 Fruits is a simple and basic game, with a structure that includes 5 reels, 3 rows of symbols, and only 5 paylines. The gameplay relies on spinning and stopping the reels to trigger the winning of big prizes by forming combinations from left to right. Although there are no special animations or features, the gameplay is functional and can be enjoyable for experienced players.\n\nSymbols and Payouts\n\nThe symbols in 6 Fruits are all fruit-themed, including watermelons, plums, lemons, grapes, cherries, and the number 7. The cherry symbol is the only one that triggers doubled payments but also offers the lowest payout. The number 7 is the most valuable symbol, awarding winnings of 100 or 5,000 times the bet. The watermelons, plums, lemons, and grapes offer payouts from 20x to 500x the value of the bet. The star symbol acts as a Scatter, rewarding players with monetary rewards from 10 to 250 times the bet but does not unlock any special functions.\n\nRetro Style\n\n6 Fruits has a clean and basic design, with no pompous ornament or special animations. The graphics and soundtrack are reminiscent of the old school of gaming reproduced on modern platforms, which could appeal to players who love the style of retro casinos. However, the game may not be as visually appealing to newcomers who are looking for more modern slots with flashy graphics and more special features.\n\nPaylines\n\n6 Fruits includes only 5 paylines, which is a small number compared to most online slots. However, the game compensates for this by offering multipliers on the prizes that accumulate, which can increase the payouts on the winning combinations.\n\nRTP\n\n6 Fruits has an RTP of 95.64%, which is in line with most slots that can be found online. This means that, on average, the game will pay back 95.64 cents on every dollar wagered over time. This solid RTP is an incredible advantage for the game.\n\n        \n            ",

Sweep everything away and rediscover some healthy simplicity by playing 6 Fruits, which is the epitome of a clean and basic game. Retro-style entertainment passes through Synot Games developers who love to offer retro slots. Rediscovering the naturalness of gambling through fruit-themed machines is a fun way to breathe the true essence of the game. What we find on the screen is a structure with 5 reels and three rows of symbols, for only 5 paylines. There is nothing more essential than this! You can spin and stop the reels, wait for the symbols to descend and trigger the winning of big prizes by relying on a strategy that will be functional and winning. But are there also bonus features? Continue reading our review to find answers to all your questions!\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nClean screen, devoid of any pompous ornament: 6 Fruits focuses on the game and not on its appearance. And this is how a slot that could easily recall one of the old models in casinos or bars is digitized. For graphics and soundtrack it is very reminiscent of the old school of gaming reproduced on modern platforms. What do we find? The title immediately reveals everything that the machine gives us: we have the 6 fruit symbols to match in the hope of unlocking important winnings. Six different icons that can activate multipliers on the prizes that accumulate. It is the only way that a player has to take part in profitable sessions. Combinations are formed from left to right, combining two or more identical symbols on a payline. The only symbol that triggers doubled payments is the cherry, which is also the image that offers the lowest payout. The absolute leader is the number 7 which instead awards winnings of 100 or 5,000 times the bet. The watermelons, plums, lemons and grapes are not bad either, paying from 20x and 500x the value of your bet. The star is an icon that rewards from 10 to 250 times your bet and is chosen with the role of Scatter. However, it is a somewhat anomalous Scatter compared to what modern slots show us because it offers only a monetary reward but does not unlock special functions.\n\nFinal considerations on the 6 Fruits slot\nWe have come to the end of our journey aboard 6 Fruits and we must certainly recognize one thing: it will not be a slot that will conquer all players, but it is a game that has value for those who love the style of retro casinos. It has a simple, good gameplay that could capture experienced players and not so much beginner bettors. On the other hand, newcomers may be fascinated by other types of games, graphics and animations. However, it has an incredible advantage: its RTP is solid and is set at 95.64%, which is in line with most slots that can be found online.\n        ",
