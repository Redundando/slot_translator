            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Lucky Neko: Gigablox\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nLucky Neko: Gigablox is a game by Yggdrasil Gaming that takes you on a journey to Japan and is based on the lucky daruma dolls. These dolls are rich in symbolism and are considered a talisman of good fortune in Japanese culture. The game has a calming soundtrack and a spa-like feel. \n\nThe slot machine has 6 reels and between 40 to 85 paylines. The game is playable on all devices, with bets starting from 8 cents per spin. Gigablox is the standout feature here, with symbols appearing as large as 4x4 in the base game and up to 6x6 during the Free Spins feature for bigger wins. \n\nThe graphics are very zen, with cherry blossom trees and lucky cats adding to the Japanese theme. The foggy setting gives the impression that the game takes place at dawn, while the well-manicured courtyard adds an element of zen to the picture. \n\nThe symbols include low-value club, diamond, spade, and heart symbols that appear on the daruma doll cases. The high-value symbols are the colorful daruma dolls, with the pink doll being the most rewarding. The golden cat is the wild symbol and replaces all regular symbols. \n\nThe game has a simple and enjoyable gameplay experience with synced reels that result in larger symbols occupying up to 4x4 squares on the grid. \n\nFree Spins are triggered by landing five or more scatters, with the number of free spins increasing with each additional scatter. The reel-set increases to eight rows and six reels, with 85 paylines. The bonus also includes a \"blessed\" symbol that multiplies the chosen symbol by 5x for the duration of the bonus. \n\nFor those who enjoy Japanese-themed slots, we recommend Hanzo's Dojo by Yggdrasil Gaming or Big Shots by Playtech for their large symbols potential for massive wins of up to 25,600x your bet on each free spin. With a theoretical return of 96.40% and medium-high volatility, Lucky Neko: Gigablox is a game that's worth a spin for any experienced gambler.\n        ",

These dolls are rich in symbolism and are considered a talisman of good fortune in Japanese culture. The game has a calming soundtrack and a spa-like feel. \n\nThe slot machine has 6 reels and between 40 to 85 paylines. The game is playable on all devices, with bets starting from 8 cents per spin. Gigablox is the standout feature here, with symbols appearing as large as 4x4 in the base game and up to 6x6 during the Free Spins feature for bigger wins. \n\nThe graphics are very zen, with cherry blossom trees and lucky cats adding to the Japanese theme. The foggy setting gives the impression that the game takes place at dawn, while the well-manicured courtyard adds an element of zen to the picture. \n\nThe symbols include low-value club, diamond, spade, and heart symbols that appear on the daruma doll cases. The high-value symbols are the colorful daruma dolls, with the pink doll being the most rewarding. The golden cat is the wild symbol and replaces all regular symbols. \n\nThe game has a simple and enjoyable gameplay experience with synced reels that result in larger symbols occupying up to 4x4 squares on the grid. \n\nFree Spins are triggered by landing five or more scatters, with the number of free spins increasing with each additional scatter. The reel-set increases to eight rows and six reels, with 85 paylines. The bonus also includes a \"blessed\" symbol that multiplies the chosen symbol by 5x for the duration of the bonus. \n\nFor those who enjoy Japanese-themed slots, we recommend Hanzo's Dojo by Yggdrasil Gaming or Big Shots by Playtech for their large symbols potential for massive wins of up to 25,600x your bet on each free spin. With a theoretical return of 96.40% and medium-high volatility, Lucky Neko: Gigablox is a game that's worth a spin for any experienced gambler.\n            ",

The slot machine has 6 reels and between 40 to 85 paylines. Gigablox is the standout feature, with symbols appearing as large as 4x4 in the base game and up to 6x6 during the Free Spins feature for bigger wins.

The high-value symbols are the colorful daruma dolls, with the pink doll being the most rewarding. The golden cat is the wild symbol and replaces all regular symbols. The game has a simple and enjoyable gameplay experience with synced reels that result in larger symbols occupying up to 4x4 squares on the grid. \n\nGigablox feature\n\nGigablox is the standout feature of Lucky Neko: Gigablox, with symbols appearing as large as 4x4 in the base game and up to 6x6 during the Free Spins feature for bigger wins.
