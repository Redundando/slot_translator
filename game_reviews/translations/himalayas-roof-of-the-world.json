            "response": "Himalayas Roof of The World is a must-try slot game by Barcrest that boasts 5 reels and 100 paylines inspired by the iconic mountain range. Tibetan elements are added to the game including an avalanche feature that creates a trail of wilds across the reels. Its highlight is the Free Spins Bonus feature where you get up to 20 free spins – where wild spins transform into double Icicle Wild spins that expand to cover the entire reel. With the compass symbol, you can win more free spins on the Treasure Map. And don’t forget the Big Bet feature where you play 5 consecutive spins with only 2 bonus symbols needed to activate the Free Spins Bonus (up to 50 free spins) where low-value symbols are removed and a Wild reel is added.\n\nThe game that boasts stunning graphics is powered by Barcrest and has 5 reels, 10 rows and 100 paylines. Playable from €0.10 to €500 per spin on any device, it has a Snow Slide Bonus feature randomly activated after an avalanche that rewards wild symbols across the reels that may lead to big wins. The Free Spins Bonus feature includes random Snow Wilds and expanding Icicle Wild symbols. Finally, it includes a Big Bet feature.\n\nHimalayas Roof of the World is inspired by the Himalayan mountain range that separates the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau - with the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest as the background. With Tibetan symbols such as hearts, shovels, sticks, diamonds, tents, picks, tigers, eagles, and even Tibetan ladies and monks standing 3 symbols high. The latter is the highest paying symbol, giving you 50 times your bet for 5 on a payline. There is also an Ice Wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the Lady, the Monk and the Bonus symbols. When played at €2 or less per spin, the RTP is 94% – and when played above €2 in bet, it shoots up to 96%.\n\nAs for the bonus features, the Snow Slide Bonus feature randomly activates during the base game when there is an avalanche that spreads wild symbols across the reels resulting in big wins. Then there’s the Free Spins Bonus feature where getting 3, 4, or 5 Himalayan Bonus symbols gives you 8, 12, or 20 free spins respectively. Also, the Snow Slide Bonus feature can be reactivated during free spins. And most importantly, the reels contain double-height Icicle Wild symbols that expand to cover the entire reel!\n\nKeep an eye on the compass symbol on reel 5, as this increases the chances of triggering the Free Spins Bonus feature – every compass that appears on the reels will increase the winning segment of the Mystery Free Spins compass by 1/5. The needle then spins to determine if you will win more free spins – you’ll be taken to the Himalayan map that contains 4 trails. Each of which contains a random number of free spins that are added to the total. \n\nAs a Barcrest slot, Himalayas Roof of the World also comes with a Big Bet feature where you play a series of 5 rolls linked together - you can chose between options costing €20, €30, and €50. The €20 option requires 2 or more bonus symbols to activate the Free Spins Bonus feature – 2, 3, 4 or 5 bonus symbols will give you 8, 12, 20 or 50 free spins. The same goes for the €30 option, but all low value symbols are removed from the reels. In the €50 option, you get the same as above but with 1 wild reel. Finally, the RTP% increases to 97,75%.\n\nVisually, Himalayas Roof of the World is beautiful and features stunning artwork – in terms of bonus features, we like the Snow Slide Bonus feature that can add more wilds to the reels. It gets even better in the Free Spins Bonus feature, where you get double-height Icicle wild reels that expand to form full wild reels.\n\nWe also recommend trying other Barcrest slots such as Hercules High & Mighty, for those who want the same adrenaline rush as playing Himalayas Roof of The World.",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Himalayas Roof of The World\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nHimalayas Roof of The World is a must-try slot game by Barcrest that boasts 5 reels and 100 paylines inspired by the iconic mountain range. Tibetan elements are added to the game including an avalanche feature that creates a trail of wilds across the reels. Its highlight is the Free Spins Bonus feature where you get up to 20 free spins – where wild spins transform into double Icicle Wild spins that expand to cover the entire reel. With the compass symbol, you can win more free spins on the Treasure Map. And don’t forget the Big Bet feature where you play 5 consecutive spins with only 2 bonus symbols needed to activate the Free Spins Bonus (up to 50 free spins) where low-value symbols are removed and a Wild reel is added.\n\nThe game that boasts stunning graphics is powered by Barcrest and has 5 reels, 10 rows and 100 paylines. Playable from €0.10 to €500 per spin on any device, it has a Snow Slide Bonus feature randomly activated after an avalanche that rewards wild symbols across the reels that may lead to big wins. The Free Spins Bonus feature includes random Snow Wilds and expanding Icicle Wild symbols. Finally, it includes a Big Bet feature.\n\nHimalayas Roof of the World is inspired by the Himalayan mountain range that separates the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau - with the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest as the background. With Tibetan symbols such as hearts, shovels, sticks, diamonds, tents, picks, tigers, eagles, and even Tibetan ladies and monks standing 3 symbols high. The latter is the highest paying symbol, giving you 50 times your bet for 5 on a payline. There is also an Ice Wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the Lady, the Monk and the Bonus symbols. When played at €2 or less per spin, the RTP is 94% – and when played above €2 in bet, it shoots up to 96%.\n\nAs for the bonus features, the Snow Slide Bonus feature randomly activates during the base game when there is an avalanche that spreads wild symbols across the reels resulting in big wins. Then there’s the Free Spins Bonus feature where getting 3, 4, or 5 Himalayan Bonus symbols gives you 8, 12, or 20 free spins respectively. Also, the Snow Slide Bonus feature can be reactivated during free spins. And most importantly, the reels contain double-height Icicle Wild symbols that expand to cover the entire reel!\n\nKeep an eye on the compass symbol on reel 5, as this increases the chances of triggering the Free Spins Bonus feature – every compass that appears on the reels will increase the winning segment of the Mystery Free Spins compass by 1/5. The needle then spins to determine if you will win more free spins – you’ll be taken to the Himalayan map that contains 4 trails. Each of which contains a random number of free spins that are added to the total. \n\nAs a Barcrest slot, Himalayas Roof of the World also comes with a Big Bet feature where you play a series of 5 rolls linked together - you can chose between options costing €20, €30, and €50. The €20 option requires 2 or more bonus symbols to activate the Free Spins Bonus feature – 2, 3, 4 or 5 bonus symbols will give you 8, 12, 20 or 50 free spins. The same goes for the €30 option, but all low value symbols are removed from the reels. In the €50 option, you get the same as above but with 1 wild reel. Finally, the RTP% increases to 97,75%.\n\nVisually, Himalayas Roof of the World is beautiful and features stunning artwork – in terms of bonus features, we like the Snow Slide Bonus feature that can add more wilds to the reels. It gets even better in the Free Spins Bonus feature, where you get double-height Icicle wild reels that expand to form full wild reels.\n\nWe also recommend trying other Barcrest slots such as Hercules High & Mighty, for those who want the same adrenaline rush as playing Himalayas Roof of The World.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame overview and developer\nMain features of the game\nGameplay and paying options\nFree Spins Bonus\nIcicle Wild symbol\nBig Bet Feature\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Himalayas Roof of The World is a must-try slot game by Barcrest that boasts 5 reels and 100 paylines inspired by the iconic mountain range. Tibetan elements are added to the game including an avalanche feature that creates a trail of wilds across the reels. Its highlight is the Free Spins Bonus feature where you get up to 20 free spins – where wild spins transform into double Icicle Wild spins that expand to cover the entire reel. With the compass symbol, you can win more free spins on the Treasure Map. And don’t forget the Big Bet feature where you play 5 consecutive spins with only 2 bonus symbols needed to activate the Free Spins Bonus (up to 50 free spins) where low-value symbols are removed and a Wild reel is added.\n\nThe game that boasts stunning graphics is powered by Barcrest and has 5 reels, 10 rows and 100 paylines. Playable from €0.10 to €500 per spin on any device, it has a Snow Slide Bonus feature randomly activated after an avalanche that rewards wild symbols across the reels that may lead to big wins. The Free Spins Bonus feature includes random Snow Wilds and expanding Icicle Wild symbols. Finally, it includes a Big Bet feature.\n\nHimalayas Roof of the World is inspired by the Himalayan mountain range that separates the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau - with the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest as the background. With Tibetan symbols such as hearts, shovels, sticks, diamonds, tents, picks, tigers, eagles, and even Tibetan ladies and monks standing 3 symbols high. The latter is the highest paying symbol, giving you 50 times your bet for 5 on a payline. There is also an Ice Wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the Lady, the Monk and the Bonus symbols. When played at €2 or less per spin, the RTP is 94% – and when played above €2 in bet, it shoots up to 96%.\n\nAs for the bonus features, the Snow Slide Bonus feature randomly activates during the base game when there is an avalanche that spreads wild symbols across the reels resulting in big wins. Then there’s the Free Spins Bonus feature where getting 3, 4, or 5 Himalayan Bonus symbols gives you 8, 12, or 20 free spins respectively. Also, the Snow Slide Bonus feature can be reactivated during free spins. And most importantly, the reels contain double-height Icicle Wild symbols that expand to cover the entire reel!\n\nKeep an eye on the compass symbol on reel 5, as this increases the chances of triggering the Free Spins Bonus feature – every compass that appears on the reels will increase the winning segment of the Mystery Free Spins compass by 1/5. The needle then spins to determine if you will win more free spins – you’ll be taken to the Himalayan map that contains 4 trails. Each of which contains a random number of free spins that are added to the total. \n\nAs a Barcrest slot, Himalayas Roof of the World also comes with a Big Bet feature where you play a series of 5 rolls linked together - you can chose between options costing €20, €30, and €50. The €20 option requires 2 or more bonus symbols to activate the Free Spins Bonus feature – 2, 3, 4 or 5 bonus symbols will give you 8, 12, 20 or 50 free spins. The same goes for the €30 option, but all low value symbols are removed from the reels. In the €50 option, you get the same as above but with 1 wild reel. Finally, the RTP% increases to 97,75%.\n\nVisually, Himalayas Roof of the World is beautiful and features stunning artwork – in terms of bonus features, we like the Snow Slide Bonus feature that can add more wilds to the reels. It gets even better in the Free Spins Bonus feature, where you get double-height Icicle wild reels that expand to form full wild reels.\n\nWe also recommend trying other Barcrest slots such as Hercules High & Mighty, for those who want the same adrenaline rush as playing Himalayas Roof of The World.\n            ",

But, if you're playing it cool, then the RTP is a respectable 94% at €2.00 or less per spin. So why wait? Start spinning those reels and let us know when you hit the jackpot!</p>\"\n}"

The game includes elements inspired by Tibetan culture and has an avalanche feature that creates a trail of wilds across the reels.\n\nMain features of the game\n\nThe game features stunning graphics and includes a Snow Slide Bonus feature that randomly activates after an avalanche and rewards wild symbols on the reels that may lead to big wins. The Free Spins Bonus feature includes random Snow Wilds and expanding Icicle Wild symbols that transform into double Icicle Wild spins that expand to cover the entire reel. The game includes a Big Bet feature where you get to play 5 consecutive spins with only 2 bonus symbols needed to activate the Free Spins Bonus (up to 50 free spins) where low-value symbols are removed and a Wild reel is added.\n\nGameplay and paying options\n\nThe game is playable on any device from €0.10 to €500 per spin. Players can win up to 50 times their bet for 5 Tibetan ladies or monks standing 3 symbols high and the Ice Wild symbol replaces all symbols except the Lady, the Monk, and the Bonus symbols. The game's RTP is 94% when played at €2 or less per spin but increases to 96% when played above €2 in bet. \n\nFree Spins Bonus\n\nThe Free Spins Bonus feature is triggered by getting 3, 4, or 5 Himalayan Bonus symbols that give you 8, 12, or 20 free spins respectively. The Snow Slide Bonus feature can be reactivated during free spins. The reels contain double-height Icicle Wild symbols that expand to cover the entire reel during free spins, and players can win more free spins on the Treasure Map with the Compass symbol.\n\nIcicle Wild symbol\n\nThe Icicle Wild symbol transforms into double Icicle Wild spins that expand to cover the entire reel during the Free Spins Bonus feature. It replaces all symbols except the Lady, the Monk, and the Bonus symbols and can lead to big wins.\n\nBig Bet Feature\n\nThe big bet feature allows players to play a series of 5 rolls linked together with options costing €20, €30, and €50. The €20 option requires 2 or more bonus symbols to activate the Free Spins Bonus feature – 2, 3, 4, or 5 bonus symbols will give you 8, 12, 20, or 50 free spins. The same goes for the €30 option, but all low-value symbols are removed from the reels. In the €50 option, you get the same as above but with 1 wild reel.

Tibetan elements are added to the game including an avalanche feature that creates a trail of wilds across the reels. Its highlight is the Free Spins Bonus feature where you get up to 20 free spins – where wild spins transform into double Icicle Wild spins that expand to cover the entire reel. With the compass symbol, you can win more free spins on the Treasure Map. And don’t forget the Big Bet feature where you play 5 consecutive spins with only 2 bonus symbols needed to activate the Free Spins Bonus (up to 50 free spins) where low-value symbols are removed and a Wild reel is added.\n\nThe game that boasts stunning graphics is powered by Barcrest and has 5 reels, 10 rows and 100 paylines. Playable from €0.10 to €500 per spin on any device, it has a Snow Slide Bonus feature randomly activated after an avalanche that rewards wild symbols across the reels that may lead to big wins. The Free Spins Bonus feature includes random Snow Wilds and expanding Icicle Wild symbols. Finally, it includes a Big Bet feature.\n\nHimalayas Roof of the World is inspired by the Himalayan mountain range that separates the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau - with the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest as the background. With Tibetan symbols such as hearts, shovels, sticks, diamonds, tents, picks, tigers, eagles, and even Tibetan ladies and monks standing 3 symbols high. The latter is the highest paying symbol, giving you 50 times your bet for 5 on a payline. There is also an Ice Wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the Lady, the Monk and the Bonus symbols. When played at €2 or less per spin, the RTP is 94% – and when played above €2 in bet, it shoots up to 96%.\n\nAs for the bonus features, the Snow Slide Bonus feature randomly activates during the base game when there is an avalanche that spreads wild symbols across the reels resulting in big wins. Then there’s the Free Spins Bonus feature where getting 3, 4, or 5 Himalayan Bonus symbols gives you 8, 12, or 20 free spins respectively. Also, the Snow Slide Bonus feature can be reactivated during free spins. And most importantly, the reels contain double-height Icicle Wild symbols that expand to cover the entire reel!\n\nKeep an eye on the compass symbol on reel 5, as this increases the chances of triggering the Free Spins Bonus feature – every compass that appears on the reels will increase the winning segment of the Mystery Free Spins compass by 1/5. The needle then spins to determine if you will win more free spins – you’ll be taken to the Himalayan map that contains 4 trails. Each of which contains a random number of free spins that are added to the total. \n\nAs a Barcrest slot, Himalayas Roof of the World also comes with a Big Bet feature where you play a series of 5 rolls linked together - you can chose between options costing €20, €30, and €50. The €20 option requires 2 or more bonus symbols to activate the Free Spins Bonus feature – 2, 3, 4 or 5 bonus symbols will give you 8, 12, 20 or 50 free spins. The same goes for the €30 option, but all low value symbols are removed from the reels. In the €50 option, you get the same as above but with 1 wild reel. Finally, the RTP% increases to 97,75%.\n\nVisually, Himalayas Roof of the World is beautiful and features stunning artwork – in terms of bonus features, we like the Snow Slide Bonus feature that can add more wilds to the reels. It gets even better in the Free Spins Bonus feature, where you get double-height Icicle wild reels that expand to form full wild reels.\n\nWe also recommend trying other Barcrest slots such as Hercules High & Mighty, for those who want the same adrenaline rush as playing Himalayas Roof of The World.\n            ",

Tibetan elements are added to the game including an avalanche feature that creates a trail of wilds across the reels. Its highlight is the Free Spins Bonus feature where you get up to 20 free spins – where wild spins transform into double Icicle Wild spins that expand to cover the entire reel. With the compass symbol, you can win more free spins on the Treasure Map. And don’t forget the Big Bet feature where you play 5 consecutive spins with only 2 bonus symbols needed to activate the Free Spins Bonus (up to 50 free spins) where low-value symbols are removed and a Wild reel is added.\n\nThe game that boasts stunning graphics is powered by Barcrest and has 5 reels, 10 rows and 100 paylines. Playable from €0.10 to €500 per spin on any device, it has a Snow Slide Bonus feature randomly activated after an avalanche that rewards wild symbols across the reels that may lead to big wins. The Free Spins Bonus feature includes random Snow Wilds and expanding Icicle Wild symbols. Finally, it includes a Big Bet feature.\n\nHimalayas Roof of the World is inspired by the Himalayan mountain range that separates the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau - with the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest as the background. With Tibetan symbols such as hearts, shovels, sticks, diamonds, tents, picks, tigers, eagles, and even Tibetan ladies and monks standing 3 symbols high. The latter is the highest paying symbol, giving you 50 times your bet for 5 on a payline. There is also an Ice Wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the Lady, the Monk and the Bonus symbols. When played at €2 or less per spin, the RTP is 94% – and when played above €2 in bet, it shoots up to 96%.\n\nAs for the bonus features, the Snow Slide Bonus feature randomly activates during the base game when there is an avalanche that spreads wild symbols across the reels resulting in big wins. Then there’s the Free Spins Bonus feature where getting 3, 4, or 5 Himalayan Bonus symbols gives you 8, 12, or 20 free spins respectively. Also, the Snow Slide Bonus feature can be reactivated during free spins. And most importantly, the reels contain double-height Icicle Wild symbols that expand to cover the entire reel!\n\nKeep an eye on the compass symbol on reel 5, as this increases the chances of triggering the Free Spins Bonus feature – every compass that appears on the reels will increase the winning segment of the Mystery Free Spins compass by 1/5. The needle then spins to determine if you will win more free spins – you’ll be taken to the Himalayan map that contains 4 trails. Each of which contains a random number of free spins that are added to the total. \n\nAs a Barcrest slot, Himalayas Roof of the World also comes with a Big Bet feature where you play a series of 5 rolls linked together - you can chose between options costing €20, €30, and €50. The €20 option requires 2 or more bonus symbols to activate the Free Spins Bonus feature – 2, 3, 4 or 5 bonus symbols will give you 8, 12, 20 or 50 free spins. The same goes for the €30 option, but all low value symbols are removed from the reels. In the €50 option, you get the same as above but with 1 wild reel. Finally, the RTP% increases to 97,75%.\n\nVisually, Himalayas Roof of the World is beautiful and features stunning artwork – in terms of bonus features, we like the Snow Slide Bonus feature that can add more wilds to the reels. It gets even better in the Free Spins Bonus feature, where you get double-height Icicle wild reels that expand to form full wild reels.\n\nWe also recommend trying other Barcrest slots such as Hercules High & Mighty, for those who want the same adrenaline rush as playing Himalayas Roof of The World.\n        ",
