Produced by IGT, the game is set in ancient Egypt, where you can engage in a quest to discover hidden treasures.\n\nSpecial Symbols and Features\n\nThe Sphinx slot machine includes a variety of special symbols and features that help increase your chances of winning. The wild (the head of the pharaoh's sarcophagus) replaces all symbols except the coin. The scatter symbol (the medallion with the beetle) pays in every position. Meanwhile, the coin symbol activates the Sphinx Bonus Game. Additionally, the game offers a unique \"Gamble\" function, allowing you to double your winnings by betting on the red or black card game.\n\nSphinx Bonus Game\n\nBy displaying 3 or more coin symbols on a payline, the Sphinx Bonus Game is activated, taking you into the pyramid in search of treasures. The first room you encounter in the game features standing sarcophagi, where you have the chance to win cash prizes. If the miniature Sphinx is found in one of the sarcophagi, you can access a second room with much higher prizes.\n\nGraphics of the Game\n\nThe graphics of the Sphinx slot machine are minimalist, created using computer graphics reminiscent of the early 2000s. However, the game's bonus round is more visually appealing, with a style reminiscent of iconic video games such as Lara Croft or Indiana Jones. The symbols of the game include pyramids, fans, amulets, statues, and coins, as well as the head of the pharaoh's sarcophagus.\n\nPayout Percentage\n\nThe theoretical average payout of the Sphinx slot machine is 93-95%, making it moderately interesting in terms of payouts.\n\nSimilar Slots\n\nIf you enjoy slots dedicated to ancient Egypt, other similar games to try include Book of Ra (Novomatic) Deluxe version, Sphinx Wild (its \"wild\" version), Cleopatra (produced by IGT), Dan of Egypt (Play’n’Go), Ancient Egypt Classics (Pragmatic Play), Egyptian King (iSoftbet), Rise of Egypt (Playson), Egyptian Heroes (NetEnt), and Age of Egypt (Playtech).\n\nOverall Popularity\n\nThe Sphinx slot machine has been a great success in Italy and Europe, making IGT (once known as GTECH) a popular provider of slot machines. The game features constant engagement and a desire to explore the pyramid to discover the sarcophagus rooms, with the bonus round adding an extra layer of fun. Sphinx has made history in the industry and is still sought after by many players today.\n\n        \n            ",

The bonus round, however, has a more pleasant effect, as it recalls the legendary video games such as Lara Croft or Indiana Jones.\nThe symbols of the slot include the head of the pharaoh's sarcophagus (the game's wild), pyramids, fans, amulets, statues, and a medallion (the scatter symbol), as well as coins (the bonus activator).\nIn the bonus round, you enter the rooms of the pyramid, facing sarcophagi in which treasures are hidden.\n\nSpecial features and bonuses of the Sphinx slot machine are activated with special symbols:\n\nWild (the head of the pharaoh) replaces all symbols in the game to create winning combinations. The only symbol that cannot be replaced is the coin.\nScatter (the medallion with the beetle) pays in every position\nBonus symbol (the coin) activates the Sphinx Bonus Game\n\nBy displaying 3 or more coin symbols on a payline, the Sphinx Bonus Game is activated, offering entry into the pyramid and its treasures. The first room you find in the game is the one with standing sarcophagi, where you can win cash prizes. If the miniature Sphinx is found in one of the sarcophagi, you can access a second room with much higher prizes.\nAnother special feature is the \"Gamble\" function, which allows you to double your winnings several times (x2 or x4 up to a maximum of 5 times) by betting on the red or black card game.\n\nThe Sphinx slot machine is a game that has made history in the industry, with great success in Italy and Europe. It can be said that it has made the fortune of its provider, IGT (once known as GTECH), risen to fame on specialized online slot machine sites and new online casinos.\nThe gaming experience is very enjoyable, with a constant desire to enter the pyramid to open the sarcophagus rooms. The bonus games, when engaging, add the right amount of fun. The theoretical average payout of the Sphinx slot machine is 93-95%, making it moderately interesting in terms of payouts.\n\nFAQ Sphinx Slot - Frequently Asked Questions\nWhere can I play Sphinx slot machine for free?\nYou can play the Sphinx slot machine for free on SlotJava and hundreds of other slots without registering or downloading anything.\n\nHow do I win?\nYou win based on the combinations of identical symbols obtained on each spin.
