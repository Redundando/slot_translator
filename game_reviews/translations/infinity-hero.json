Questa nuova creazione Wazdan è un gioco con grandi vincite da avere, insieme a tutti i soliti campanelli e fischietti che tendono ad accompagnare le loro produzioni, in particolare la capacità di impostare il rating di volatilità.\nProgettato con bobine 6×3, questo gioco offre 20 linee, quindi le possibilità di essere pagati sono circa come in altre nuove slot. Le vincite fino a 13.000x la puntata sono menzionate, quindi c’è un potenziale impressionante qui, in un gioco che permette di modificare il suo rating di volatilità lungo il percorso. Tutto questo, e l’RTP è a un comodo 96,24%. Se vi interessano di più le caratteristiche, allora dovreste conoscere le caratteristiche Wild del gioco, gli scatters, o i giri liberi con un moltiplicatore infinito.\nUna grafica da veri supereroi\nIn termini di design grafico, il gioco ha lo stesso stile di altri giochi che hanno un look da fumetto. Un bell’esempio è la slot Jack Hammer di NetEnt o la slot Agent Destiny di Play’n GO. Lo stile può essere simile, ma l’approccio è molto diverso, perché non abbiamo ancora visto nessuno, oltre a Wazdan, fare un gioco a tema di frutta in questa prospettiva.\nLa slot Infinity Hero è molto dinamica e divertente da giocare. C’è l’animazione in questo gioco perché tutti i simboli sono soggetti a un vortice nel frullatore quando cadono nel tipo di corrispondenza su una payline. Il supereroe dell’infinito non sta abbandonando il suo set di bobine, in quanto i giocatori possono vederlo saltare dentro e fuori dallo schermo, giocando con una bomba o semplicemente vantandosi.\nÈ in parte un classico tema di frutta, in parte un supereroe, ed è tutto disegnato in uno stile da fumetto che rasenta la caricatura, almeno per quanto riguarda il personaggio principale. Sembra divertente, però, e questo è tutto ciò che conta. Non è facile far sembrare divertente un tema di frutta, ma Infinity Hero ci riesce.\nCome simboli, hanno l’Hero Scatter, la Bomb Wild, Lucky 7s, angurie, prugne, pere, arance, limoni e ciliegie.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nL’impostazione per il gameplay ha sempre fatto parte dell’esperienza di gioco sulle slot Wazdan, perché il gioco ha pochi pulsanti aggiuntivi sul layout dei controlli rispetto ad altri fornitori.\nPer esempio, il giocatore può scegliere da solo il livello di volatilità premendo il pulsante del peperoncino che si trova a sinistra del grande pulsante rotondo “spin”. Ci sono tre livelli, come al solito: basso, medio e alto.\nUn’altra impostazione è la velocità di rotazione delle bobine. Questo è il piccolo pulsante rotondo nell’angolo superiore della barra delle impostazioni. La tartaruga, la lepre e il cavallo determinano se la vostra avventura con le bobine si svolgerà ad un ritmo lento, normale o super veloce.\nIn termini di payout, la slot Infinity Hero si fa decisamente rispettare. Tre ciliegie pagano il minimo di tutti gli altri simboli. Il limone, l’arancia, la pera e la prugna sono gli altri simboli a basso pagamento i cui valori sono tra 0,15x e 1x volte la tua scommessa per tre.\nL’atterraggio vincente con sei simboli paga i premi migliori. Sei angurie pagano 17,5x, il simbolo sette paga 25x, Wild paga 50x e lo scatter vale 10x per sei.\nPrima di fare il primo giro sulla slot Infinity Hero è meglio scegliere la vostra scommessa prima, perché la scommessa predefinita del casinò potrebbe essere di 100,00€ per esempio, e questo potrebbe strapparvi un pezzo dal vostro equilibrio o ingoiarlo completamente, a meno che non abbiate raggiunto una vincita proprio all’inizio.\nLa gamma di scommesse ha un massimo di €100,00 per giro e un minimo di €0,20, tuttavia, i giocatori possono utilizzare la scala scorrevole nella parte inferiore dei rulli per scegliere uno qualsiasi degli importi disponibili.\nNonostante tutti i frutti sulla tabella dei pagamenti, il nome del gioco è qualcosa di non correlato. E perché? Cosa c’è di così infinitesimale in questo eroe? La chiave è nel bonus di giri gratis dove i risultati vincenti possono guadagnare moltiplicatori di vincita che vanno da 1x all’infinito.\nPer attivare il bonus sono necessari tre scatter per dieci giri. Ogni risultato vincente aumenta il moltiplicatore di 1+. Un simbolo che rappresenta uno strano aggeggio aggiunge più giri al file – che potrebbe essere +3, +5 o +7 giri gratuiti.\nIl bonus rende possibile al gioco di andare in una folle frenesia di giri gratis e i moltiplicatori di vincita possono ammontare a vincite in contanti fino a 13.000x.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nLa slot Spinfinity Man presenta un reel-set basato su una griglia di sette per sette, che mostra una serie di simboli ad alta e bassa remunerazione in un cluster di vittorie e le bobine adiacenti vincono il tipo di gioco.

It's safe to say that Wazdan has raised the bar for fruit-themed slots in this perspective!\n\nInfinity Hero is highly dynamic and enjoyable to play.

Three cherries pay the least of all the other symbols.

Sei angurie pagano 17,5x, il simbolo sette paga 25x, Wild paga 50x e lo scatter vale 10x per sei.\nPrima di fare il primo giro sulla slot Infinity Hero è meglio scegliere la vostra scommessa prima, perché la scommessa predefinita del casinò potrebbe essere di 100,00€ per esempio, e questo potrebbe strapparvi un pezzo dal vostro equilibrio o ingoiarlo completamente, a meno che non abbiate raggiunto una vincita proprio all’inizio.\nLa gamma di scommesse ha un massimo di €100,00 per giro e un minimo di €0,20, tuttavia, i giocatori possono utilizzare la scala scorrevole nella parte inferiore dei rulli per scegliere uno qualsiasi degli importi disponibili.\nNonostante tutti i frutti sulla tabella dei pagamenti, il nome del gioco è qualcosa di non correlato. E perché? Cosa c’è di così infinitesimale in questo eroe? La chiave è nel bonus di giri gratis dove i risultati vincenti possono guadagnare moltiplicatori di vincita che vanno da 1x all’infinito.\nPer attivare il bonus sono necessari tre scatter per dieci giri. Ogni risultato vincente aumenta il moltiplicatore di 1+. Un simbolo che rappresenta uno strano aggeggio aggiunge più giri al file – che potrebbe essere +3, +5 o +7 giri gratuiti.\nIl bonus rende possibile al gioco di andare in una folle frenesia di giri gratis e i moltiplicatori di vincita possono ammontare a vincite in contanti fino a 13.000x.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nLa slot Spinfinity Man presenta un reel-set basato su una griglia di sette per sette, che mostra una serie di simboli ad alta e bassa remunerazione in un cluster di vittorie e le bobine adiacenti vincono il tipo di gioco. La slot è stata sviluppata da BetSoft: si tratta di veri e propri esperti nel realizzare giochi incredibili. La gamma di scommesse è ampia e accogliente – i giocatori possono giocare con €0.50 o €6.50 o meno o più. Il gioco ha un bonus di giri gratis, moltiplicatori e modificatori di bobina.\n\n        ",

The layout features 20 fixed paylines that can result in winning combinations with at least three matching symbols. Infinity Hero boasts a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.24% and offers low, medium, and high variance options to choose from.\n\nInfluenced by superhero culture, but also incorporating a fruit theme with comic book style graphics, Infinity Hero breaks the mold of typical slot games with its unique design. This new creation by Wazdan offers big wins, along with the usual bells and whistles that accompany their productions, particularly the ability to adjust the volatility rating.\n\nDesigned with 6x3 reels, this game offers 20 paylines, providing payout possibilities similar to other new slots. Wins up to 13,000 times the bet are mentioned, showing the impressive potential of this game, which allows players to modify its volatility rating. All of this comes with a comfortable 96.24% RTP. For those interested in features, the game offers Wild symbols, scatters, or free spins with an infinite multiplier.\n\nGraphics fit for a superhero\n\nIn terms of graphic design, the game has the same cartoon-like style as other comic book inspired slots such as NetEnt's Jack Hammer or Play'n GO's Agent Destiny. Though the style may be similar, the approach is different. It's safe to say that Wazdan has raised the bar for fruit-themed slots in this perspective!\n\nInfinity Hero is highly dynamic and enjoyable to play. The symbols are subject to a vortex in a blender when matched on a payline, adding animation to the game. The superhero doesn't abandon his set of reels, as players can see him jumping in and out of the screen, playing with the Bomb Wild or simply boasting.\n\nIt's partly a classic fruit theme, part superhero, all presented in a cartoon-like style that approaches caricature, at least when it comes to the main character. Despite this, it looks fun and that's what matters. It's not easy to make a fruit theme look fun, but Infinity Hero manages to do just that.\n\nAs symbols, there is the Hero Scatter, the Bomb Wild, Lucky 7s, watermelons, plums, pears, oranges, lemons, and cherries.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nGameplay settings have always been part of the Wazdan slot experience, with the game featuring only a few additional buttons on the control layout compared to other providers.\n\nFor example, players can adjust the volatility level themselves by pressing the chili button to the left of the big round \"spin\" button. There are three levels of volatility to choose from: low, medium, and high.\n\nAnother setting is the reel spin speed. This is the small round button in the upper corner of the settings bar. The turtle, hare, and horse determine whether your reel adventure will take place at a slow, normal, or super-fast pace.\n\nIn terms of payouts, Infinity Hero does not disappoint. Three cherries pay the least of all the other symbols. Lemons, oranges, pears, and plums are the other low-paying symbols with values between 0.15x and 1x times your bet for three.\n\nLanding a winning combination of six symbols pays the best prizes. Six watermelons pay 17.5x, the Lucky 7s symbol pays 25x, the Wild pays 50x, and the Scatter is worth 10x for six.\n\nBefore the first spin on Infinity Hero, it's best to choose your bet first, as the casino's default bet could be €100.00, for example, which could take a chunk out of your balance or swallow it up completely, unless you've had a win right from the start.\n\nThe betting range has a maximum of €100.00 per spin and a minimum of €0.20. However, players can use the sliding scale at the bottom of the reels to choose any available amount.\n\nDespite the fruit on the paytable, the name of the game is not related to it. And why is that? What's so infinite about this hero? The key is in the free spins bonus where winning results can earn unlimited win multipliers ranging from 1x to infinity.\n\nTo activate the bonus, three Scatters are required for ten spins. Each winning outcome increases the multiplier by 1+. A symbol representing a strange gadget adds more spins to the file - which could be +3, +5, or +7 free spins.\n\nThe bonus makes it possible for the game to go into a frenzy of free spins and payout multipliers that can amount to cash wins of up to 13,000x.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nSpinfinity Man features a 7x7 reel set, showing a series of high and low paying symbols in a cluster of wins and adjacent reels win type of gameplay. Developed by BetSoft, experts in creating incredible games, the betting range is wide and welcoming - players can play with €0.50 or less or more.

The layout features 20 fixed paylines that can result in winning combinations with at least three matching symbols. Infinity Hero boasts a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.24% and offers low, medium, and high variance options to choose from.\n\nInfluenced by superhero culture, but also incorporating a fruit theme with comic book style graphics, Infinity Hero breaks the mold of typical slot games with its unique design. This new creation by Wazdan offers big wins, along with the usual bells and whistles that accompany their productions, particularly the ability to adjust the volatility rating.\n\nDesigned with 6x3 reels, this game offers 20 paylines, providing payout possibilities similar to other new slots. Wins up to 13,000 times the bet are mentioned, showing the impressive potential of this game, which allows players to modify its volatility rating. All of this comes with a comfortable 96.24% RTP. For those interested in features, the game offers Wild symbols, scatters, or free spins with an infinite multiplier.\n\nGraphics fit for a superhero\n\nIn terms of graphic design, the game has the same cartoon-like style as other comic book inspired slots such as NetEnt's Jack Hammer or Play'n GO's Agent Destiny. Though the style may be similar, the approach is different. It's safe to say that Wazdan has raised the bar for fruit-themed slots in this perspective!\n\nInfinity Hero is highly dynamic and enjoyable to play. The symbols are subject to a vortex in a blender when matched on a payline, adding animation to the game. The superhero doesn't abandon his set of reels, as players can see him jumping in and out of the screen, playing with the Bomb Wild or simply boasting.\n\nIt's partly a classic fruit theme, part superhero, all presented in a cartoon-like style that approaches caricature, at least when it comes to the main character. Despite this, it looks fun and that's what matters. It's not easy to make a fruit theme look fun, but Infinity Hero manages to do just that.\n\nAs symbols, there is the Hero Scatter, the Bomb Wild, Lucky 7s, watermelons, plums, pears, oranges, lemons, and cherries.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nGameplay settings have always been part of the Wazdan slot experience, with the game featuring only a few additional buttons on the control layout compared to other providers.\n\nFor example, players can adjust the volatility level themselves by pressing the chili button to the left of the big round \"spin\" button. There are three levels of volatility to choose from: low, medium, and high.\n\nAnother setting is the reel spin speed. This is the small round button in the upper corner of the settings bar. The turtle, hare, and horse determine whether your reel adventure will take place at a slow, normal, or super-fast pace.\n\nIn terms of payouts, Infinity Hero does not disappoint. Three cherries pay the least of all the other symbols. Lemons, oranges, pears, and plums are the other low-paying symbols with values between 0.15x and 1x times your bet for three.\n\nLanding a winning combination of six symbols pays the best prizes. Six watermelons pay 17.5x, the Lucky 7s symbol pays 25x, the Wild pays 50x, and the Scatter is worth 10x for six.\n\nBefore the first spin on Infinity Hero, it's best to choose your bet first, as the casino's default bet could be €100.00, for example, which could take a chunk out of your balance or swallow it up completely, unless you've had a win right from the start.\n\nThe betting range has a maximum of €100.00 per spin and a minimum of €0.20. However, players can use the sliding scale at the bottom of the reels to choose any available amount.\n\nDespite the fruit on the paytable, the name of the game is not related to it. And why is that? What's so infinite about this hero? The key is in the free spins bonus where winning results can earn unlimited win multipliers ranging from 1x to infinity.\n\nTo activate the bonus, three Scatters are required for ten spins. Each winning outcome increases the multiplier by 1+. A symbol representing a strange gadget adds more spins to the file - which could be +3, +5, or +7 free spins.\n\nThe bonus makes it possible for the game to go into a frenzy of free spins and payout multipliers that can amount to cash wins of up to 13,000x.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nSpinfinity Man features a 7x7 reel set, showing a series of high and low paying symbols in a cluster of wins and adjacent reels win type of gameplay. Developed by BetSoft, experts in creating incredible games, the betting range is wide and welcoming - players can play with €0.50 or less or more. The game offers free spins bonuses, multipliers, and reel modifiers.\n            ",

Wins up to 13,000 times the bet are possible, and players can modify the game's volatility rating.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols in Infinity Hero include the Hero Scatter, the Bomb Wild, Lucky 7s, watermelons, plums, pears, oranges, lemons, and cherries.\n\nFree spins bonus\n\nThe game's free spins bonus activates when three Scatters appear, providing ten free spins. Each winning outcome increases the payout multiplier by 1+. A symbol representing a strange gadget adds more spins to the file, which could be +3, +5, or +7 free spins. This bonus has unlimited win multipliers ranging from 1x to infinity, which can amount to cash wins of up to 13,000x.\n\nGameplay features\n\nPlayers can adjust the volatility level themselves by pressing the chili button to the left of the big round 'spin' button. There are three levels of volatility to choose from: low, medium, and high. Another setting is the reel spin speed, which has three modes: slow, normal, and super-fast. Before the first spin, players should choose their bet, which has a maximum of €100.00 per spin and a minimum of €0.20. However, players can use the sliding scale at the bottom of the reels to choose any available amount.\n\nDesign and graphics\n\nInfinity Hero incorporates a fruit theme with comic-book style graphics. The cartoon-like style and the superhero culture influence join in a way that is fun and dynamic. The symbols are subject to a vortex in a blender when matched on a payline, adding animation to the game. The superhero doesn't abandon his set of reels, as players can see him jumping in and out of the screen, playing with the Bomb Wild or simply boasting. The game is similar in graphic design to other comic book inspired slots such as NetEnt's Jack Hammer or Play'n GO's Agent Destiny. However, the approach is different here, raising the bar for fruit-themed slots.\n\n        \n            ",

The layout features 20 fixed paylines that can result in winning combinations with at least three matching symbols. Infinity Hero boasts a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.24% and offers low, medium, and high variance options to choose from.\n\nInfluenced by superhero culture, but also incorporating a fruit theme with comic book style graphics, Infinity Hero breaks the mold of typical slot games with its unique design. This new creation by Wazdan offers big wins, along with the usual bells and whistles that accompany their productions, particularly the ability to adjust the volatility rating.\n\nDesigned with 6x3 reels, this game offers 20 paylines, providing payout possibilities similar to other new slots. Wins up to 13,000 times the bet are mentioned, showing the impressive potential of this game, which allows players to modify its volatility rating. All of this comes with a comfortable 96.24% RTP. For those interested in features, the game offers Wild symbols, scatters, or free spins with an infinite multiplier.\n\nGraphics fit for a superhero\n\nIn terms of graphic design, the game has the same cartoon-like style as other comic book inspired slots such as NetEnt's Jack Hammer or Play'n GO's Agent Destiny. Though the style may be similar, the approach is different. It's safe to say that Wazdan has raised the bar for fruit-themed slots in this perspective!\n\nInfinity Hero is highly dynamic and enjoyable to play. The symbols are subject to a vortex in a blender when matched on a payline, adding animation to the game. The superhero doesn't abandon his set of reels, as players can see him jumping in and out of the screen, playing with the Bomb Wild or simply boasting.\n\nIt's partly a classic fruit theme, part superhero, all presented in a cartoon-like style that approaches caricature, at least when it comes to the main character. Despite this, it looks fun and that's what matters. It's not easy to make a fruit theme look fun, but Infinity Hero manages to do just that.\n\nAs symbols, there is the Hero Scatter, the Bomb Wild, Lucky 7s, watermelons, plums, pears, oranges, lemons, and cherries.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nGameplay settings have always been part of the Wazdan slot experience, with the game featuring only a few additional buttons on the control layout compared to other providers.\n\nFor example, players can adjust the volatility level themselves by pressing the chili button to the left of the big round \"spin\" button. There are three levels of volatility to choose from: low, medium, and high.\n\nAnother setting is the reel spin speed. This is the small round button in the upper corner of the settings bar. The turtle, hare, and horse determine whether your reel adventure will take place at a slow, normal, or super-fast pace.\n\nIn terms of payouts, Infinity Hero does not disappoint. Three cherries pay the least of all the other symbols. Lemons, oranges, pears, and plums are the other low-paying symbols with values between 0.15x and 1x times your bet for three.\n\nLanding a winning combination of six symbols pays the best prizes. Six watermelons pay 17.5x, the Lucky 7s symbol pays 25x, the Wild pays 50x, and the Scatter is worth 10x for six.\n\nBefore the first spin on Infinity Hero, it's best to choose your bet first, as the casino's default bet could be €100.00, for example, which could take a chunk out of your balance or swallow it up completely, unless you've had a win right from the start.\n\nThe betting range has a maximum of €100.00 per spin and a minimum of €0.20. However, players can use the sliding scale at the bottom of the reels to choose any available amount.\n\nDespite the fruit on the paytable, the name of the game is not related to it. And why is that? What's so infinite about this hero? The key is in the free spins bonus where winning results can earn unlimited win multipliers ranging from 1x to infinity.\n\nTo activate the bonus, three Scatters are required for ten spins. Each winning outcome increases the multiplier by 1+. A symbol representing a strange gadget adds more spins to the file - which could be +3, +5, or +7 free spins.\n\nThe bonus makes it possible for the game to go into a frenzy of free spins and payout multipliers that can amount to cash wins of up to 13,000x.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nSpinfinity Man features a 7x7 reel set, showing a series of high and low paying symbols in a cluster of wins and adjacent reels win type of gameplay. Developed by BetSoft, experts in creating incredible games, the betting range is wide and welcoming - players can play with €0.50 or less or more. The game offers free spins bonuses, multipliers, and reel modifiers.\n            ",

The layout features 20 fixed paylines that can result in winning combinations with at least three matching symbols. Infinity Hero boasts a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.24% and offers low, medium, and high variance options to choose from.\n\nInfluenced by superhero culture, but also incorporating a fruit theme with comic book style graphics, Infinity Hero breaks the mold of typical slot games with its unique design. This new creation by Wazdan offers big wins, along with the usual bells and whistles that accompany their productions, particularly the ability to adjust the volatility rating.\n\nDesigned with 6x3 reels, this game offers 20 paylines, providing payout possibilities similar to other new slots. Wins up to 13,000 times the bet are mentioned, showing the impressive potential of this game, which allows players to modify its volatility rating. All of this comes with a comfortable 96.24% RTP. For those interested in features, the game offers Wild symbols, scatters, or free spins with an infinite multiplier.\n\nGraphics fit for a superhero\n\nIn terms of graphic design, the game has the same cartoon-like style as other comic book inspired slots such as NetEnt's Jack Hammer or Play'n GO's Agent Destiny. Though the style may be similar, the approach is different. It's safe to say that Wazdan has raised the bar for fruit-themed slots in this perspective!\n\nInfinity Hero is highly dynamic and enjoyable to play. The symbols are subject to a vortex in a blender when matched on a payline, adding animation to the game. The superhero doesn't abandon his set of reels, as players can see him jumping in and out of the screen, playing with the Bomb Wild or simply boasting.\n\nIt's partly a classic fruit theme, part superhero, all presented in a cartoon-like style that approaches caricature, at least when it comes to the main character. Despite this, it looks fun and that's what matters. It's not easy to make a fruit theme look fun, but Infinity Hero manages to do just that.\n\nAs symbols, there is the Hero Scatter, the Bomb Wild, Lucky 7s, watermelons, plums, pears, oranges, lemons, and cherries.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nGameplay settings have always been part of the Wazdan slot experience, with the game featuring only a few additional buttons on the control layout compared to other providers.\n\nFor example, players can adjust the volatility level themselves by pressing the chili button to the left of the big round \"spin\" button. There are three levels of volatility to choose from: low, medium, and high.\n\nAnother setting is the reel spin speed. This is the small round button in the upper corner of the settings bar. The turtle, hare, and horse determine whether your reel adventure will take place at a slow, normal, or super-fast pace.\n\nIn terms of payouts, Infinity Hero does not disappoint. Three cherries pay the least of all the other symbols. Lemons, oranges, pears, and plums are the other low-paying symbols with values between 0.15x and 1x times your bet for three.\n\nLanding a winning combination of six symbols pays the best prizes. Six watermelons pay 17.5x, the Lucky 7s symbol pays 25x, the Wild pays 50x, and the Scatter is worth 10x for six.\n\nBefore the first spin on Infinity Hero, it's best to choose your bet first, as the casino's default bet could be €100.00, for example, which could take a chunk out of your balance or swallow it up completely, unless you've had a win right from the start.\n\nThe betting range has a maximum of €100.00 per spin and a minimum of €0.20. However, players can use the sliding scale at the bottom of the reels to choose any available amount.\n\nDespite the fruit on the paytable, the name of the game is not related to it. And why is that? What's so infinite about this hero? The key is in the free spins bonus where winning results can earn unlimited win multipliers ranging from 1x to infinity.\n\nTo activate the bonus, three Scatters are required for ten spins. Each winning outcome increases the multiplier by 1+. A symbol representing a strange gadget adds more spins to the file - which could be +3, +5, or +7 free spins.\n\nThe bonus makes it possible for the game to go into a frenzy of free spins and payout multipliers that can amount to cash wins of up to 13,000x.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nSpinfinity Man features a 7x7 reel set, showing a series of high and low paying symbols in a cluster of wins and adjacent reels win type of gameplay. Developed by BetSoft, experts in creating incredible games, the betting range is wide and welcoming - players can play with €0.50 or less or more. The game offers free spins bonuses, multipliers, and reel modifiers.\n            ",
