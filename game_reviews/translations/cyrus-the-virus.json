Parliamo di una slot machine online che è prodotta dagli sviluppatori di Yggdrasil Gaming, i quali vogliono puntare su un approccio creativo e innovativo rispetto al settore gambling online. Per farlo è stata progettata una slot con 5 rulli e 10 linee di pagamento che ha una modesta quantità di funzioni aggiuntive bonus da provare. E’ un titolo comodamente disponibile sia per desktop, che mobile e offre enormi montepremi con ben 80mila euro e un’alta percentuale di vincite. Se ti incuriosisce il tema della fantascienza, tra lenti del microscopio e germi da studiare sei nel posto giusto: vediamo allora quali sono le sue funzionalità tra giri gratuiti e moltiplicatori, tra jolly in espansione e un RTP elevato che si ferma a quota 96,30%!\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nParliamo di virus e qui dobbiamo muoverci con delicatezza: il concetto stesso della slot machine è stato trattato con responsabilità e ha un aspetto carino considerando le diverse forme e colori scelti. Man mano che le immagini e le icone si posizioneranno sullo schermo, ti renderai conto che l’atmosfera è tutt’altro che serena e inizierà a diventare sempre più preoccupante e misteriosa. All’inizio del gioco gli importi vinti sono minori rispetto a quanto si può ottenere quando i virus cresceranno. Si hai capito bene: qui si deve giocare proprio dalla “parte sbagliata”! Più il virus aumenta e maggiore è la vincita che conquisti. I simboli che sostengono la grafica sono abbastanza particolari, senza dubbio: abbiamo una serie di virus tra cui spicca quello blu, con i tentacoli che ti premia fino a 2.000 volte con 5 apparizioni contemporanee sulla griglia di gioco. Secondo per valore è il virus arancione con 400 monete per 5 icone; quello giallo 300, poi il verde neon con 200, il verde a 150, il color smeraldo con 120 e il simbolo viola a 100 monete. Quando realizzi una combo vincente si attiverà una piccola animazione che rende ancora più grottesca la situazione, vista la tematica del gioco.\nMancano invece i giri gratuiti e i moltiplicatori, sostituiti da un sistema di payline che funziona in entrambi i lati. E come dimenticare il suo jolly, il filamento di DNA, che è in espansione per aumentare le possibilità di creare combinazioni vincenti.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Cyrus the Virus\nCyrus the Virus è una selezione di virus dannosi in diverse forme e colorazioni, che ti porteranno a vivere un’esperienza di gioco particolare. Ha scelto sicuramente un tema inusuale e una grafica che non propone nulla di innovativo. Ma se consideriamo le vincite e quindi i benefici del gioco, possiamo dire che il virus “benefico” si ottiene attraverso le vittorie. La slot machine ha infatti un ritorno favorevole grazie alla percentuale verso i giocatori.

This online slot machine produced by Yggdrasil Gaming developers takes a creative and innovative approach when it comes to the online gambling industry. It features 5 reels and 10 paylines and has a modest quantity of bonus features to try out. It's easily accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, offering huge jackpots of up to €80,000 and a high percentage of wins. If you're intrigued by the science fiction theme, with microscope lenses and germs to investigate, then you're in the right place. Let's take a look at its features, including free spins, multipliers, expanding wilds, and a high RTP of 96.30%!\n\nGraphics and Symbols\n\nWe're talking about viruses here, so we need to tread carefully. The very concept of the slot machine has been treated with responsibility and care, with cute shapes and colors chosen. As the images and icons appear on the screen, you'll realize that the atmosphere is anything but serene and will soon become increasingly ominous and mysterious. At first, the winnings are smaller than what you can obtain when the viruses grow. Yes, you understood it right: you have to play on the \"wrong side\" here! The larger the virus gets, the greater the chances of winning. The graphics supporting the virus theme are unique and special. We have a series of viruses, with the blue one standing out. Its tentacles will reward you up to 2,000 times with 5 simultaneous appearances on the game board. Second in value is the orange virus with 400 coins for 5 icons. You then have the yellow one with 300, the neon green with 200, the light green with 150, the emerald color with 120, and the purple symbol with 100 coins. When you achieve a winning combination, a small animation adds a touch of grotesquery to the situation, considering the game's theme.\n\nFeatures\n\nThis game lacks free spins and multipliers, but it compensates for this with a payline system that works on both sides. And let's not forget the expanding DNA filament, which acts as the game's wild symbol, increasing your chances of creating winning combinations.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Cyrus the Virus\n\nCyrus the Virus offers a selection of harmful viruses in various shapes and colors, making for a particular gaming experience. While it might have chosen an unusual theme and unremarkable graphics, if we consider the winnings and game benefits, we can say that you can benefit from the virus with every victory.

We're talking about an online slot machine produced by Yggdrasil Gaming developers, who aim to take a creative and innovative approach to the online gambling industry. To do this, they have designed a slot with 5 reels and 10 paylines that has a modest amount of bonus features to try out. It's a title comfortably available for both desktop and mobile, and offers huge jackpots with €80,000 and a high percentage of winning opportunities. If you are intrigued by the science-fiction theme, with microscopic lenses and germs to study, then you've come to the right place. Let's see what its features are, with free spins and multipliers, expanding wilds, and a high RTP that stops at 96.30%!\nGraphics and gameplay symbols\nWe're talking about viruses and we must move delicately here. The concept of the slot machine has been handled responsibly, with a cute appearance considering the different shapes and colors chosen. As the images and icons appear on the screen, you will realize that the atmosphere is anything but serene and it will become more and more worrying and mysterious. At the beginning of the game, the amounts won are smaller compared to what can be obtained when the viruses grow. Yes, you read that right: here you have to play on the \"wrong side\"! The more the virus grows, the greater the win you conquer. The graphics supporting the symbols are quite unique: we have a series of viruses among which the blue one stands out, with tentacles that reward you up to 2,000 times with 5 simultaneous appearances on the playing field. Second in value is the orange virus with 400 coins for 5 icons; the yellow one has 300, followed by the neon green with 200, green at 150, emerald color with 120, and purple symbol with 100 coins. When you realize a winning combo, a small animation will activate that makes the situation even more grotesque, given the game's theme.\nOn the other hand, there are no free spins or multipliers, replaced by a payline system that works on both sides. And how can we forget its wild, the DNA filament, which is expanding to increase the chances of creating winning combinations.\nFinal thoughts on Cyrus the Virus slot\nCyrus the Virus is a selection of harmful viruses in different shapes and colors that will give you a unique gaming experience. It certainly has chosen an unusual theme and graphics that do not propose anything innovative. But if we consider the wins and therefore the benefits of the game, we can say that the \"beneficial\" virus is obtained through victories. The slot machine has a favorable return thanks to the percentage towards players. It is true, however, that it will not change your life, but if you are lucky, the jackpot amount can become truly interesting.

We're talking about an online slot machine produced by Yggdrasil Gaming developers, who aim to take a creative and innovative approach to the online gambling industry. To do this, they have designed a slot with 5 reels and 10 paylines that has a modest amount of bonus features to try out. It's a title comfortably available for both desktop and mobile, and offers huge jackpots with €80,000 and a high percentage of winning opportunities. If you are intrigued by the science-fiction theme, with microscopic lenses and germs to study, then you've come to the right place. Let's see what its features are, with free spins and multipliers, expanding wilds, and a high RTP that stops at 96.30%!\nGraphics and gameplay symbols\nWe're talking about viruses and we must move delicately here. The concept of the slot machine has been handled responsibly, with a cute appearance considering the different shapes and colors chosen. As the images and icons appear on the screen, you will realize that the atmosphere is anything but serene and it will become more and more worrying and mysterious. At the beginning of the game, the amounts won are smaller compared to what can be obtained when the viruses grow. Yes, you read that right: here you have to play on the \"wrong side\"! The more the virus grows, the greater the win you conquer. The graphics supporting the symbols are quite unique: we have a series of viruses among which the blue one stands out, with tentacles that reward you up to 2,000 times with 5 simultaneous appearances on the playing field. Second in value is the orange virus with 400 coins for 5 icons; the yellow one has 300, followed by the neon green with 200, green at 150, emerald color with 120, and purple symbol with 100 coins. When you realize a winning combo, a small animation will activate that makes the situation even more grotesque, given the game's theme.\nOn the other hand, there are no free spins or multipliers, replaced by a payline system that works on both sides. And how can we forget its wild, the DNA filament, which is expanding to increase the chances of creating winning combinations.\nFinal thoughts on Cyrus the Virus slot\nCyrus the Virus is a selection of harmful viruses in different shapes and colors that will give you a unique gaming experience. It certainly has chosen an unusual theme and graphics that do not propose anything innovative. But if we consider the wins and therefore the benefits of the game, we can say that the \"beneficial\" virus is obtained through victories. The slot machine has a favorable return thanks to the percentage towards players. It is true, however, that it will not change your life, but if you are lucky, the jackpot amount can become truly interesting. However, try to take advantage of functions such as Expanding Wilds, Re-Spin, and Stacked Wilds to achieve the best!\n            ",

We're talking about an online slot machine produced by Yggdrasil Gaming developers, who aim to take a creative and innovative approach to the online gambling industry. To do this, they have designed a slot with 5 reels and 10 paylines that has a modest amount of bonus features to try out. It's a title comfortably available for both desktop and mobile, and offers huge jackpots with €80,000 and a high percentage of winning opportunities. If you are intrigued by the science-fiction theme, with microscopic lenses and germs to study, then you've come to the right place. Let's see what its features are, with free spins and multipliers, expanding wilds, and a high RTP that stops at 96.30%!\nGraphics and gameplay symbols\nWe're talking about viruses and we must move delicately here. The concept of the slot machine has been handled responsibly, with a cute appearance considering the different shapes and colors chosen. As the images and icons appear on the screen, you will realize that the atmosphere is anything but serene and it will become more and more worrying and mysterious. At the beginning of the game, the amounts won are smaller compared to what can be obtained when the viruses grow. Yes, you read that right: here you have to play on the \"wrong side\"! The more the virus grows, the greater the win you conquer. The graphics supporting the symbols are quite unique: we have a series of viruses among which the blue one stands out, with tentacles that reward you up to 2,000 times with 5 simultaneous appearances on the playing field. Second in value is the orange virus with 400 coins for 5 icons; the yellow one has 300, followed by the neon green with 200, green at 150, emerald color with 120, and purple symbol with 100 coins. When you realize a winning combo, a small animation will activate that makes the situation even more grotesque, given the game's theme.\nOn the other hand, there are no free spins or multipliers, replaced by a payline system that works on both sides. And how can we forget its wild, the DNA filament, which is expanding to increase the chances of creating winning combinations.\nFinal thoughts on Cyrus the Virus slot\nCyrus the Virus is a selection of harmful viruses in different shapes and colors that will give you a unique gaming experience. It certainly has chosen an unusual theme and graphics that do not propose anything innovative. But if we consider the wins and therefore the benefits of the game, we can say that the \"beneficial\" virus is obtained through victories. The slot machine has a favorable return thanks to the percentage towards players. It is true, however, that it will not change your life, but if you are lucky, the jackpot amount can become truly interesting. However, try to take advantage of functions such as Expanding Wilds, Re-Spin, and Stacked Wilds to achieve the best!\n        ",
