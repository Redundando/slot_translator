The few symbols in the game are well-designed with attention to detail. The game's background is a forest, and there is no real grid, but the symbols land in a space irradiated with green light and bordered by two trees. The reels are divided by thin vines that drop from above. The buttons are engraved stones with Celtic symbols, which add to the mysterious atmosphere of this game. The music also contributes to the overall ambiance, complementing the game's delicate but beautiful design.\n\nSmall grid, few lines\nIn Enchanted Forest, the grid is 3x3, with five fixed pay lines. The base bet is 0.30 €, which can be increased as one wishes. Among the different betting options, we find the Autoplay, which allows us to set the number of automatic spins, and even win and loss limits. The Turbo function can also be used to accelerate the reel's rotation. The game's volatility is low, and the theoretical return to player is 95.57%.\n\nSymbols and Bonuses\nEnchanted Forest has eight symbols, including the runes, which replace playing cards and have the lowest value. The most profitable symbols are the animal statues. The Golden Mask Wild serves as the wild and replaces all symbols. It can also appear stacked. A special feature is the Twin Respin, which is triggered when two reels are filled with identical symbols and causes the third to spin automatically. If the entire grid is filled with the same symbols, the Wheel of Truth feature is activated. The prize is a spin on a special wheel, which can give multipliers up to 10x or the True Respin function, which awards 15 free spins with only high-value symbols. With the Bonus Bet feature, players can win higher prizes.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the theoretical return to player in Enchanted Forest?\nThe RTP value is 95.57%, which is not very low, but slightly below the average of other slot games.\n\nHow many symbols are in Enchanted Forest?\nThere are eight base symbols and one special symbol.\n\nAre there any special features in the game?\nYes, Twin Respin, Wheel of Truth, True Respin, and the Bonus Bet feature, which is however payable.",

The game offers a base bet of 0.30 € and different betting options, including the Autoplay and Turbo functions. The game's volatility is low, and the theoretical return to player is 95.57%.\n\nDesign and Theme\n\nThe game's background is a forest, and the symbols land in a space irradiated with green light and bordered by two trees. The reels are divided by thin vines that drop from above. The buttons are engraved stones with Celtic symbols, adding to the mysterious atmosphere. The music also complements the game's delicate but beautiful design.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nEnchanted Forest offers eight symbols, including the runes that replace playing cards and have the lowest value. The most profitable symbols are the animal statues. The Golden Mask Wild serves as the wild and can appear stacked. The game has five fixed paylines, and the Bonus Bet feature can be used to win higher prizes.\n\nBonus Features\n\nEnchanted Forest offers four special features: Twin Respin, Wheel of Truth, True Respin, and the Bonus Bet feature. Twin Respin is triggered when two reels are filled with identical symbols and causes the third to spin automatically. If the entire grid is filled with the same symbols, the Wheel of Truth feature is activated. The prize is a spin on a special wheel, which can give multipliers up to 10x or the True Respin function, awarding 15 free spins with only high-value symbols. With the Bonus Bet feature, players can win higher prizes.\n\nPayout and Prizes\n\nEnchanted Forest offers a high payout despite having few gameplay features. The theoretical return to player is 95.57%, and the game's volatility is low, making it suitable for players looking for small but frequent wins. The Bonus Bet feature can be used to win higher prizes, and the Wheel of Truth feature can give multipliers up to 10x or the True Respin function, awarding 15 free spins with only high-value symbols.\n\n        \n            ",

The few symbols in the game are well-designed with attention to detail. The game's background is a forest, and there is no real grid, but the symbols land in a space irradiated with green light and bordered by two trees. The reels are divided by thin vines that drop from above. The buttons are engraved stones with Celtic symbols, which add to the mysterious atmosphere of this game. The music also contributes to the overall ambiance, complementing the game's delicate but beautiful design.\n\nSmall grid, few lines\nIn Enchanted Forest, the grid is 3x3, with five fixed pay lines. The base bet is 0.30 €, which can be increased as one wishes. Among the different betting options, we find the Autoplay, which allows us to set the number of automatic spins, and even win and loss limits. The Turbo function can also be used to accelerate the reel's rotation. The game's volatility is low, and the theoretical return to player is 95.57%.\n\nSymbols and Bonuses\nEnchanted Forest has eight symbols, including the runes, which replace playing cards and have the lowest value. The most profitable symbols are the animal statues. The Golden Mask Wild serves as the wild and replaces all symbols. It can also appear stacked. A special feature is the Twin Respin, which is triggered when two reels are filled with identical symbols and causes the third to spin automatically. If the entire grid is filled with the same symbols, the Wheel of Truth feature is activated. The prize is a spin on a special wheel, which can give multipliers up to 10x or the True Respin function, which awards 15 free spins with only high-value symbols. With the Bonus Bet feature, players can win higher prizes.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the theoretical return to player in Enchanted Forest?\nThe RTP value is 95.57%, which is not very low, but slightly below the average of other slot games.\n\nHow many symbols are in Enchanted Forest?\nThere are eight base symbols and one special symbol.\n\nAre there any special features in the game?\nYes, Twin Respin, Wheel of Truth, True Respin, and the Bonus Bet feature, which is however payable.\n        ",
