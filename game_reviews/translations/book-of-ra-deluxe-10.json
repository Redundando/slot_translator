Queste sono solo alcune delle caratteristiche dell’Antico Egitto, una delle ambientazioni maggiormente amate nel mondo delle slot online.\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 della Novomatic fa parte di una fortunata serie di slot, una fra le più amate sull’Antico Egitto e che ci porterà a scoprire ricchezze nascoste fra le sabbie del deserto. Iniziamo, quindi, la nostra recensione di Book of Ra Deluxe 10 dal suo comparto sia visivo che sonoro.\n\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 – Grafica\nSullo sfondo di quella che sembra una ricostruzione di un antico palazzo egizio, colorato dalla luce rossa e calda del tramonto, troviamo la griglia di gioco di Book of Ra Deluxe 10. O per meglio dire: le griglie.\nInfatti avremo ben due griglie di gioco che ricordano delle antiche lastre di pietra con scolpiti sopra dei geroglifici e decorate di rosso e blu. I simboli della slot sono, in realtà, piuttosto comuni con la serie di Book of Ra della Novomatic. Oltre a quelli più tradizionali delle carte da gioco (A, K, Q, J e 10) che sono iniziali e numeri in un font che ricorda i geroglifici, se ne trovano altri legati all’ambientazione della slot come la testa del sarcofago d’oro di Tutankhamon, la statua alata della dea Iside, la moneta con la dea-gatta Bastet, lo scarabeo blu e il libro di Ra. Ma oltre a queste c’è anche l’immancabile protagonista della slot: l’avventuriero sorridente che ricorda molto il ben più famoso archeologo con il fedora del cinema.\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 è una slot visivamente molto apprezzabile e curata ma che non sembra discostarsi troppo dagli altri titoli della stessa serie.\nPassiamo, quindi, al gameplay della slot.\n\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 – 80 Simboli a ogni giocata\nBasta uno sguardo a questa slot per capire che il suo meccanismo di gioco è completamente diverso rispetto alla maggior parte dei titoli che possono essere trovati online.\nDavanti a noi troviamo due griglie di gioco: quella a sinistra utilizza uno schema di tipo 5*4, con cinque rulli e quattro linee lungo le quali si dispongono i venti simboli a ogni turno.\nA destra si trova una specie di estensione dei cinque rulli di cui abbiamo appena parlato, i quali vengono accompagnati da ben dodici linee di simboli, mostrandone così sessanta a ogni giocata.\nQueste due griglie non sono completamente separate tra di loro: tanto per fare un esempio, il simbolo Wild della moneta può espandersi sull’intero rullo di entrambe le griglie. In un attimo potremmo così ritrovarci con decine di simboli Wild e relative potenziali combinazioni.\nÈ bello vedere come, sebbene sfruttando la stessa tematica e illustrazioni, per una volta la saga di Book of Ra si sia mossa in una direzione diversa dal solito.\n\nSlot simili a Book of Ra Deluxe 10\nInutile dire che le slot a tema Antico Egitto non mancano mai. Alcuni esempi di slot molto interessanti sono: Pyramid Quest of Immortality, Rich Wilde and The Book of the Dead, Pyramid Treasure ed Egyptian Heroes.\n\n",

The protagonist of the slot is a smiling adventurer who looks similar to the archaeologist with the fedora from the movies. The slot's theme is Ancient Egypt, featuring pyramids, ancient treasures, and powerful gods.\n\nLayout and Design\n\nThe background of the game is a reconstruction of an ancient Egyptian palace, colored by the red and warm light of the sunset. The graphics and design of the game are visually pleasing and well-crafted, resembling the other titles in the Book of Ra series. The slot has two separate game grids, one on the left with a 5x4 type schema, and the other on the right, which is an extension of the five reels with twelve lines of symbols. The game grids are not entirely separate, and Wild symbols can expand on both grids.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nThere are many slots centered on Ancient Egypt, such as Pyramid Quest of Immortality, Rich Wilde and The Book of the Dead, Pyramid Treasure, and Egyptian Heroes.\n\nOverall Impression\n\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 is a well-crafted online slot game that differs from the other titles in the same Book of Ra series due to its unique gameplay mechanism with two game grids.

These are just some of the features of Ancient Egypt, one of the most beloved themes in the world of online slots.\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 by Novomatic is part of a successful series of slots, one of the most beloved on Ancient Egypt, which will lead us to discover hidden riches among the sands of the desert. Let's start our review of Book of Ra Deluxe 10 with its visual and sound aspects.\n\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 – Graphics\nOn the background of what seems to be a reconstruction of an ancient Egyptian palace, colored by the red and warm light of the sunset, we find the game grid of Book of Ra Deluxe 10. Or rather: the grids.\nIn fact, we will have two game grids that resemble ancient stone slabs carved with hieroglyphs and decorated with red and blue. The symbols of the slot are actually quite common with the Book of Ra series by Novomatic. In addition to the more traditional playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J, and 10) which are initials and numbers in a font reminiscent of hieroglyphs, there are others related to the slot's setting such as the head of Tutankhamun's gold sarcophagus, the winged statue of the goddess Isis, the coin with the cat-goddess Bastet, the blue scarab, and the Book of Ra. But in addition to these, there is also the inevitable protagonist of the slot: the smiling adventurer who looks a lot like the more famous archaeologist with the fedora from the movies.\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 is a visually pleasing and well-crafted slot, but it doesn't seem to deviate too much from the other titles in the same series.\nSo, let's move on to the gameplay of the slot.\n\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 – 80 Symbols per Spin\nJust one glance at this slot is enough to understand that its gameplay mechanism is completely different from the majority of titles that can be found online.\nIn front of us, we find two game grids: the one on the left uses a 5x4 type schema, with five reels and four lines along which the twenty symbols are arranged on each turn.\nOn the right is a sort of extension of the five reels we just talked about, which are accompanied by no less than twelve lines of symbols, showing sixty symbols on each spin.\nThese two grids are not completely separate from each other: just to give an example, the Wild symbol of the coin can expand on the entire reel of both grids. In no time at all, we could find ourselves with dozens of Wild symbols and their potential combinations.\nIt's nice to see how, although it uses the same theme and illustrations, for once the saga of Book of Ra has moved in a different direction from the usual.\n\nSlots Similar to Book of Ra Deluxe 10\nNeedless to say, Ancient Egypt-themed slots are never lacking. Some examples of very interesting slots are: Pyramid Quest of Immortality, Rich Wilde and The Book of the Dead, Pyramid Treasure, and Egyptian Heroes.\n            ",

These are just some of the features of Ancient Egypt, one of the most beloved themes in the world of online slots.\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 by Novomatic is part of a successful series of slots, one of the most beloved on Ancient Egypt, which will lead us to discover hidden riches among the sands of the desert. Let's start our review of Book of Ra Deluxe 10 with its visual and sound aspects.\n\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 – Graphics\nOn the background of what seems to be a reconstruction of an ancient Egyptian palace, colored by the red and warm light of the sunset, we find the game grid of Book of Ra Deluxe 10. Or rather: the grids.\nIn fact, we will have two game grids that resemble ancient stone slabs carved with hieroglyphs and decorated with red and blue. The symbols of the slot are actually quite common with the Book of Ra series by Novomatic. In addition to the more traditional playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J, and 10) which are initials and numbers in a font reminiscent of hieroglyphs, there are others related to the slot's setting such as the head of Tutankhamun's gold sarcophagus, the winged statue of the goddess Isis, the coin with the cat-goddess Bastet, the blue scarab, and the Book of Ra. But in addition to these, there is also the inevitable protagonist of the slot: the smiling adventurer who looks a lot like the more famous archaeologist with the fedora from the movies.\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 is a visually pleasing and well-crafted slot, but it doesn't seem to deviate too much from the other titles in the same series.\nSo, let's move on to the gameplay of the slot.\n\nBook of Ra Deluxe 10 – 80 Symbols per Spin\nJust one glance at this slot is enough to understand that its gameplay mechanism is completely different from the majority of titles that can be found online.\nIn front of us, we find two game grids: the one on the left uses a 5x4 type schema, with five reels and four lines along which the twenty symbols are arranged on each turn.\nOn the right is a sort of extension of the five reels we just talked about, which are accompanied by no less than twelve lines of symbols, showing sixty symbols on each spin.\nThese two grids are not completely separate from each other: just to give an example, the Wild symbol of the coin can expand on the entire reel of both grids. In no time at all, we could find ourselves with dozens of Wild symbols and their potential combinations.\nIt's nice to see how, although it uses the same theme and illustrations, for once the saga of Book of Ra has moved in a different direction from the usual.\n\nSlots Similar to Book of Ra Deluxe 10\nNeedless to say, Ancient Egypt-themed slots are never lacking. Some examples of very interesting slots are: Pyramid Quest of Immortality, Rich Wilde and The Book of the Dead, Pyramid Treasure, and Egyptian Heroes.\n            ",
