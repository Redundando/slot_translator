Living in herds, revered by Native Americans in the past, the buffalo is so distinctive that the United States has dedicated the first and only 99.99% pure gold coin to it. It's not surprising, therefore, that RGT has created a slot game starring this magnificent animal, and we must say the job done is fully satisfying.\n\nThe graphics may not be elaborate, but they don't affect the fun of playing this slot game. The grid occupies almost the entire screen, with the snowy peaks of Yellowstone as the background and the play buttons at the bottom. The music, with the flute simulating the wind, creates a relaxing and pleasant atmosphere.\n\nThree Jackpots and an Unusual Grid\n\nRGT has gone for a variable-sized grid: the first and fifth reels have three rows, the second and fourth have four, and the middle reel has five. The minimum bet is 4 credits, and there are up to 720 ways to win.\n\nTo win, just match identical symbols from left to right. There is also an Autoplay function and a Turbo mode that accelerates the rotation of the reels. With high volatility, the game offers three progressive jackpots: Mini, Minor, and Major.\n\nBuffalo and Other Animals\n\nIn Buffalo Mania, there are different low-level symbols that correspond to playing cards from nine to ace. Then there are more rewarding symbols, such as the wolf, jaguar, bear, and buffalo. Depending on the size of the combo and the symbol, you can win from a minimum of 20 times your bet to a maximum of 1,200!\n\nThe gold coin with the buffalo effigy is our Wild symbol, and it not only substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter but also activates the Slippery Wild Feature. This is a Walking Wild, meaning that it moves down one position after each spin. This feature is activated in both the base and bonus games.\n\nWhen three Scatters land, the Pick Bonus Feature is triggered, and you'll see three options on the screen. Depending on your choice, you'll find out a multiplier and the number of Free Spins.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I try Buffalo Mania without spending money?\n\nCertainly, Buffalo Mania, like many other slot games, is offered by our website in Demo mode, which doesn't require any payment.\n\nCan I play Buffalo Mania on my mobile?\n\nAbsolutely, this slot game allows playing on any device.\n\nWhat is the volatility of Buffalo Mania?\n\nThe volatility is medium, with a good balance between the number of spins and the frequency of wins.",

Living in herds, it was venerated in the past by native Americans. It's such a distinctive animal that the United States dedicated its first and only 99.99% pure gold coin to it – not surprising, then, that RGT has created a slot featuring this protagonist. We have to say that the work done is more than satisfactory. The graphics are not overly elaborate, but this does not detract from the enjoyment of playing this slot. The grid almost fills the entire screen, with Yellowstone's snow-capped peaks in the background, and the buttons for our plays are placed at the bottom. The music recreates the wind with flutes, creating a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere.\n\nThree Jackpots and an Unusual Grid\n\nRGT decided to focus on a variable-sized grid: the first and fifth reels have three rows, the second and fourth have four, and the middle reel has five. The minimum bet is 4 credits, and players can win in up to 720 possible ways. Winning combinations come from matching identical symbols on the reels from left to right. Both the Autoplay and Turbo functions are present, the latter speeding up the rotation of the reels. Volatility is high, and there are three progressive Jackpots: Mini, Minor, and Major.\n\nBuffalo and Other Animals\n\nIn Buffalo Mania, there are several low-level symbols corresponding to playing cards from nine to ace. Next, we find more lucrative symbols such as the wolf, jaguar, bear, and bison. Depending on the size of the combination and the symbol, players can win from a minimum of twenty times their bet to a maximum of 1,200! The gold coin with the bison's effigy is our Wild, and besides replacing all symbols except Scatter, it activates the Slippery Wild Feature. This is essentially a Walking Wild, meaning that on each subsequent spin, it will move downwards to occupy the next box. This function activates both in the base game and in the Bonus game.\n\nUpon landing three Scatters, the Pick Bonus Feature is activated. Three options will be shown on the screen, and depending on our choice, we will discover a multiplier and the number of Free Spins.\n\nFAQ\n\nCan I try Buffalo Mania without spending any money?\n\nCertainly, Buffalo Mania, like many other slots, is offered on our site in Demo mode that does not require any payment.\n\nCan I play Buffalo Mania on my mobile phone?\n\nAbsolutely yes, this slot allows you to play on any device.\n\nWhat is the volatility of Buffalo Mania?\n\nThe volatility is medium, with a good balance between the number of spins and the frequency of winnings.\n            ",

It is a five-reel slot with a variable-sized grid and up to 720 possible ways to win. The slots have Autoplay and Turbo functions and three progressive jackpots. The game offers a relaxing atmosphere with background music that recreates the wind with flutes.\n\nVariable-Sized Grid\n\nUnlike traditional slot games, Buffalo Mania features a variable-sized grid. The first and fifth reels have three rows, the second and fourth have four, and the middle wheel has five. This unusual layout can result in up to 720 possible ways to win. Players can win by matching identical symbols from left to right on the reels. The minimum bet is four credits.\n\n720 Possible Ways to Win\n\nBuffalo Mania has up to 720 possible ways to win ranging from minimum payouts of twenty times the player's bet to the maximum payout of 1,200 times the player's bet. The jackpots involve the Mini, Minor, and Major jackpots, with high volatility, which means that the frequency of wins is relatively low but pays out more when players win.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nBuffalo Mania has a wild symbol, represented by the gold coin with the bison's effigy, which replaces all symbols except the scatter. The wild symbol also activates the Slippery Wild Feature, which is a walking wild feature that moves downwards to occupy the next box on every subsequent spin in both the base and bonus game.

There are up to 720 possible ways to win. Winning combinations come from matching identical symbols on the reels from left to right. The Autoplay and Turbo functions are both present, and the latter speeds up the rotation of the reels. The volatility is high, and there are three progressive Jackpots: Mini, Minor, and Major.\n\nVariable-sized Grid\n\nRGT decided to focus on a variable-sized grid for Buffalo Mania, which is different from the usual fixed-size grids. This creates a more dynamic and exciting gameplay experience. The first and fifth reels have three rows, the second and fourth have four, and the middle reel has five.\n\nJackpots\n\nBuffalo Mania features three progressive Jackpots: Mini, Minor, and Major. These continually grow with each spin of the reels, and lucky players have the chance to win big. The Mini Jackpot is the smallest and the Major Jackpot is the largest of the three. Players must place a minimum bet of four credits to be eligible to win any of the Jackpots.\n\nWild Symbols\n\nThe gold coin with the bison's effigy is the Wild symbol in Buffalo Mania. This symbol can replace all symbols except Scatter, and it activates the Slippery Wild Feature. This is essentially a Walking Wild that moves downwards to occupy the next box on each subsequent spin. The Wild symbol feature activates in both the base game and in the Bonus game.\n\nBonus Features\n\nUpon landing three Scatters, the Pick Bonus Feature is activated. Three options are shown on the screen, and depending on our choice, we will discover a multiplier and the number of Free Spins. The Pick Bonus Feature provides an exciting opportunity for players to increase their winnings. In addition to the Pick Bonus Feature, Buffalo Mania features the Slippery Wild Feature, which activates upon landing a Wild symbol. This feature is a Walking Wild that moves downwards to occupy the next box on each subsequent spin. The Slippery Wild Feature activates in both the base game and in the Bonus game.\n\n        \n            ",

Living in herds, it was venerated in the past by native Americans. It's such a distinctive animal that the United States dedicated its first and only 99.99% pure gold coin to it – not surprising, then, that RGT has created a slot featuring this protagonist. We have to say that the work done is more than satisfactory. The graphics are not overly elaborate, but this does not detract from the enjoyment of playing this slot. The grid almost fills the entire screen, with Yellowstone's snow-capped peaks in the background, and the buttons for our plays are placed at the bottom. The music recreates the wind with flutes, creating a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere.\n\nThree Jackpots and an Unusual Grid\n\nRGT decided to focus on a variable-sized grid: the first and fifth reels have three rows, the second and fourth have four, and the middle reel has five. The minimum bet is 4 credits, and players can win in up to 720 possible ways. Winning combinations come from matching identical symbols on the reels from left to right. Both the Autoplay and Turbo functions are present, the latter speeding up the rotation of the reels. Volatility is high, and there are three progressive Jackpots: Mini, Minor, and Major.\n\nBuffalo and Other Animals\n\nIn Buffalo Mania, there are several low-level symbols corresponding to playing cards from nine to ace. Next, we find more lucrative symbols such as the wolf, jaguar, bear, and bison. Depending on the size of the combination and the symbol, players can win from a minimum of twenty times their bet to a maximum of 1,200! The gold coin with the bison's effigy is our Wild, and besides replacing all symbols except Scatter, it activates the Slippery Wild Feature. This is essentially a Walking Wild, meaning that on each subsequent spin, it will move downwards to occupy the next box. This function activates both in the base game and in the Bonus game.\n\nUpon landing three Scatters, the Pick Bonus Feature is activated. Three options will be shown on the screen, and depending on our choice, we will discover a multiplier and the number of Free Spins.\n\nFAQ\n\nCan I try Buffalo Mania without spending any money?\n\nCertainly, Buffalo Mania, like many other slots, is offered on our site in Demo mode that does not require any payment.\n\nCan I play Buffalo Mania on my mobile phone?\n\nAbsolutely yes, this slot allows you to play on any device.\n\nWhat is the volatility of Buffalo Mania?\n\nThe volatility is medium, with a good balance between the number of spins and the frequency of winnings.\n            ",

Living in herds, it was venerated in the past by native Americans. It's such a distinctive animal that the United States dedicated its first and only 99.99% pure gold coin to it – not surprising, then, that RGT has created a slot featuring this protagonist. We have to say that the work done is more than satisfactory. The graphics are not overly elaborate, but this does not detract from the enjoyment of playing this slot. The grid almost fills the entire screen, with Yellowstone's snow-capped peaks in the background, and the buttons for our plays are placed at the bottom. The music recreates the wind with flutes, creating a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere.\n\nThree Jackpots and an Unusual Grid\n\nRGT decided to focus on a variable-sized grid: the first and fifth reels have three rows, the second and fourth have four, and the middle reel has five. The minimum bet is 4 credits, and players can win in up to 720 possible ways. Winning combinations come from matching identical symbols on the reels from left to right. Both the Autoplay and Turbo functions are present, the latter speeding up the rotation of the reels. Volatility is high, and there are three progressive Jackpots: Mini, Minor, and Major.\n\nBuffalo and Other Animals\n\nIn Buffalo Mania, there are several low-level symbols corresponding to playing cards from nine to ace. Next, we find more lucrative symbols such as the wolf, jaguar, bear, and bison. Depending on the size of the combination and the symbol, players can win from a minimum of twenty times their bet to a maximum of 1,200! The gold coin with the bison's effigy is our Wild, and besides replacing all symbols except Scatter, it activates the Slippery Wild Feature. This is essentially a Walking Wild, meaning that on each subsequent spin, it will move downwards to occupy the next box. This function activates both in the base game and in the Bonus game.\n\nUpon landing three Scatters, the Pick Bonus Feature is activated. Three options will be shown on the screen, and depending on our choice, we will discover a multiplier and the number of Free Spins.\n\nFAQ\n\nCan I try Buffalo Mania without spending any money?\n\nCertainly, Buffalo Mania, like many other slots, is offered on our site in Demo mode that does not require any payment.\n\nCan I play Buffalo Mania on my mobile phone?\n\nAbsolutely yes, this slot allows you to play on any device.\n\nWhat is the volatility of Buffalo Mania?\n\nThe volatility is medium, with a good balance between the number of spins and the frequency of winnings.\n        ",
