Celebrated between January and February, Chinese New Year is a festivity where good luck is the protagonist, and each year is characterized by an animal symbol present in the Chinese zodiac. Money Mouse by Pragmatic Play is a slot that celebrates the year of the rat.\n\nMoney Mouse – Graphics\nThe slot welcomes us with its lively warm colors of the sky illuminated by the dancing lights of fireworks, as well as the game grid that takes inspiration from typical ancient Chinese buildings made of red and golden wood. The symbols that we will see scrolling on the reels are all clear references to Chinese New Year, except for the classic playing card symbols (A, K, Q, and J). Instead, there are symbols of Chinese culture, including fireworks, the head of the dragon that dances during the New Year parade, drums, ancient coins, and mandarins. Not to forget, there is a cute and smiling rat that offers us a golden ingot as a sign of good luck. As in many other typical Chinese slots, the background music is a typical oriental melody. \n\nMoney Mouse is a colorful and fun slot that shows the culture of the lively Chinese New Year with a pinch of classics from Western slots.\n\nMoney Mouse – Gameplay\nLet's move on to the technical aspect of this slot: on paper, we are faced with a title similar to many others online. Like these, Money Mouse also shares the game grid type 5*3 with fifteen symbols shown at each spin. One of the aspects that immediately catch the attention is the presence of three jackpots of different values that stand out at the top of the screen, and these are, of course, the objective of all players, although they are particularly difficult to obtain.\n\nAmong the various symbols, we find the rat that serves as a wild symbol, capable of replacing any other symbol in the game. The golden tree is instead our key to reaching the bonus mode of the title. \n\nSimilar slots to Money Mouse include 5 Fortune Dragons, Amazing Thailand, Ancient China, and in general, 90% of the slots that have a dragon in their title (the other 10% is instead used in Nordic-themed slots).\n\nAs an experienced gambler, you won't want to miss out on the chance to play Money Mouse, a delightful mix of classic and Oriental-inspired slot features that will keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat.",

The symbols we will see scrolling on the reels are all clear references to Chinese New Year. Or rather, almost all.\nIn fact, we will also find the classic symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q and J) together with Chinese culture symbols: fireworks, the head of the dragon that dances during the New Year's parades, the drums, but also trees of ancient coins and mandarins.

For example, we think of 5 Fortune Dragons, Amazing Thailand, Ancient China, and in general a good 90% of slots that have a dragon in their title (the other 10% is instead used in Nordic-themed slots).\nThere is therefore a great choice if we want to explore this theme.\n            ",

It's no surprise that even in the Western world, Chinese New Year is considered a holiday.\nCelebrated between January and February, Chinese New Year is a celebration where good luck takes center stage and each year is characterized by a symbolic animal present in the Chinese zodiac.\nMoney Mouse by Pragmatic Play is a slot that celebrates the Year of the Rat and we will talk about it in the next point of our review.\nMoney Mouse - Graphics\nThe slot welcomes us with its bright warm colors of the sky illuminated by the dancing lights of fireworks, as well as the game grid that incorporates typical ancient Chinese buildings made of red and gold wood. The symbols we will see scrolling on the reels are all clear references to Chinese New Year. Or rather, almost all.\nIn fact, we will also find the classic symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q and J) together with Chinese culture symbols: fireworks, the head of the dragon that dances during the New Year's parades, the drums, but also trees of ancient coins and mandarins. Not forgetting the cute and smiling rat that offers us a gold ingot as a sign of good luck. As in many other typically Chinese slots, the background music is a typical oriental melody.\nMoney Mouse is a colorful and funny slot, more than original, but fully showing the culture of the lively Chinese New Year with a hint of classic Western slots.\nMoney Mouse - Gameplay\nLet's move on to the technical aspect of this slot: on paper, we are facing a title similar to many others online. Like these, in fact, Money Mouse shares a game grid of 5 * 3 type with fifteen symbols shown at each play.\nOne of the aspects that immediately strikes the attention is the presence of three jackpots of different values towering at the top of the screen: these are naturally the goal of all players, although it is particularly difficult to obtain them.\nAmong the various symbols we find the rat that acts as a Wild symbol, able to replace any other symbol in play, and the golden tree that is instead our key to reaching the bonus mode of the title.\nSlots similar to Money Mouse\nThe oriental theme (and in particular the Chinese one) is widely used within the world of slot machines, so it is not difficult to find other titles that share the theme. For example, we think of 5 Fortune Dragons, Amazing Thailand, Ancient China, and in general a good 90% of slots that have a dragon in their title (the other 10% is instead used in Nordic-themed slots).\nThere is therefore a great choice if we want to explore this theme.\n            ",
