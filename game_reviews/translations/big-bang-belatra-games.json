Il tema è naturalmente lo spazio, anche se un po’ diverso da come lo conosciamo. Ci troviamo infatti su un pianeta desertico, con la griglia di gioco sistemata nell’incavo di una roccia mentre sullo sfondo abbiamo rocce sospese a mezz’aria in un cielo notturno da cui cadono stelle verticali.\nLa componente grafica è di ottima fattura, i colori sono brillanti e i simboli disegnati benissimo. I tasti principali, di grandi dimensioni, sono posizionati in basso, mentre quelli per le impostazioni secondarie sono più piccoli e si trovano in alto a sinistra, così da lasciare ampio spazio alla griglia di gioco.\nCaratteristiche di Big Bang\nLa griglia di gioco ha forma quadrata, con 8 bobine e 8 file e una vincita massima di 5.000 volte la puntata in una singola partita. Il sistema è a cluster, ciò vuol dire che le combinazioni vincenti non devono essere per forza lineari, a anche per gruppi. Ogni combinazione vincente attiva poi il classico meccanismo a cascata, per cui i simboli paganti vengono rimossi e sostituiti da altri del tutto nuovi.\nIl gioco può essere settato attraverso alcune funzioni come l’Autoplay e la funzione Turbo, che accelera la caduta dei simboli rendendo il gioco più veloce.\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore è del 96,11 %, mentre la volatilità è media.\nUn Wild/Scatter speciale\nIn Big Bang ci sono solo sei simboli tutti tematici. Per intenderci, non troverete le classiche carte da gioco che ci sono in quasi tutte le slot, ma solo astri e pianeti: Terra, Marte, Venere, Nettuno, la luna, il sole.\nPer vincere è necessario creare cluster di almeno 5 simboli sino a 25 e più.\nIl simbolo speciale è il buco nero che è sia Wild che Scatter. Nel primo caso, sostituisce tutti gli altri simboli ed è accompagnato da un moltiplicatore, inizialmente x1. A seguito di una combo vincente, prima che cadano gli altri nuovi simboli, il Wild si sposterà in una postazione libera e aumenterà di x1 il moltiplicatore. Se ci sono più Wild, i moltiplicatori relativi vengono moltiplicati tra di loro. Quando più buchi neri sono adiacenti, si formerà un unico grande Wild di dimensioni 2×2 o 3×3. A seguito della combo vincente, il simbolo grande si divide in simboli più piccoli che occuperanno le posizione liberate dai simboli paganti. Simboli dei pianeti più grandi possono verificarsi in modo casuale o quando si attiva la funzione Pioggia dei Pianeti.\nIl buco nero nella sua funzione di Scatteda diritto a tre Free Spins quando compare per tre volte; durante i giri gratuiti il simbolo speciale rimarrà sullo schermo sino alla conclusione del gioco bonus.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nQual è la volatilità di Big Bang?\n\nLa volatilità è media, con un ottimo bilanciamento tra frequenza delle giocate e somme elargite.

The theme is naturally space, although a bit different from what we know. We find ourselves on a desert planet, with the game grid set into a rock crevice while in the background we have rocks suspended in mid-air in a night sky from which vertical stars fall.\nThe graphics are of high quality, with bright colors and well-drawn symbols. The main keys, of large size, are located at the bottom, while the secondary settings keys are smaller and are located in the upper left, leaving ample space for the game grid.\n\nFeatures of Big Bang\nThe game grid is square, with 8 reels and 8 rows and a maximum win of 5,000 times the bet in a single game. The system is cluster-based, meaning that winning combinations don't have to be linear, but can also be in groups. Each winning combination then activates the classic cascading mechanism, whereby paying symbols are removed and replaced by entirely new ones.\nThe game can be set through some functions such as Autoplay and Turbo function, which accelerates the fall of symbols making the game faster.\nThe theoretical return to player is 96.11%, while the volatility is medium.\n\nA Special Wild/Scatter\nIn Big Bang there are only six thematic symbols. To be clear, you will not find the classic playing cards that are in almost all slots, but only stars and planets: Earth, Mars, Venus, Neptune, the moon, and the sun.\nTo win, it is necessary to create clusters of at least 5 symbols up to 25 and more.\nThe special symbol is the black hole which is both Wild and Scatter. In the first case, it replaces all other symbols and is accompanied by a multiplier, initially x1. After a winning combo, before the new symbols fall, the Wild will move to a free position and increase the multiplier by x1. If there are multiple Wilds, their relative multipliers are multiplied together. When multiple black holes are adjacent, a single large Wild of size 2×2 or 3×3 will form. Following the winning combo, the large symbol will divide into smaller symbols that will occupy the positions freed up by the paying symbols. Larger planet symbols can occur randomly or when the Planet Rain feature is activated.\nThe black hole in its Scatter function entitles you to three Free Spins when it appears three times; during free spins the special symbol will remain on the screen until the bonus game is over.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the volatility of Big Bang?\nThe volatility is medium, with an excellent balance between the frequency of plays and the amounts paid out. This means that you win neither high nor low amounts with a good frequency.\n\nCan I play Big Bang on a tablet?\nAbsolutely yes, this game is created with HTML5 architecture, suitable for any portable device.\n\nCan I try the game without spending money?\nCertainly, on our website, you have the opportunity to test Big Bang in Demo mode completely free.",

Each winning combination then activates the classic cascade mechanism, whereby paying symbols are removed and replaced by entirely new ones.\n\nThe game can be set through some functions such as Autoplay and Turbo mode, which speeds up the fall of symbols making the game faster.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player is 96.11%, while the volatility is medium.\n\nA special Wild/Scatter\n\nIn Big Bang, there are only six thematic symbols. To be precise, you won't find the classic playing cards that are in almost all slots, but only stars and planets: Earth, Mars, Venus, Neptune, the moon, and the sun.\n\nTo win, it is necessary to create clusters of at least 5 symbols up to 25 and more.\n\nThe special symbol is the black hole, which is both Wild and Scatter. In the first case, it replaces all other symbols and is accompanied by a multiplier, initially x1. Following a winning combo, before the other new symbols fall, the Wild will move to a free position and increase the multiplier by x1. If there are multiple wilds, the relative multipliers are multiplied together. When multiple black holes are adjacent, a single large Wild of size 2×2 or 3×3 will be formed. Following the winning combo, the large symbol divides into smaller symbols that will occupy the positions freed by the paying symbols. Larger planet symbols can occur randomly or when the Planet Rain function is activated.\n\nThe black hole in its Scatter function earns three Free Spins when it appears three times; during the free spins, the special symbol will remain on the screen until the end of the bonus game.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the volatility of Big Bang?\n\nThe volatility is medium, with an excellent balance between the frequency of plays and sums awarded. This means that you win neither high nor low amounts with good frequency.\n\nCan I play Big Bang on a tablet?\n\nAbsolutely yes, this game is created with HTML5 architecture, suitable for any portable device.\n\nCan I try the game without spending money?\n\nOf course, on our website, you are offered the possibility to test Big Bang in Demo mode entirely free of charge.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay Features\nTheme\nSpecial Symbols\nGraphics\nReturn to Player\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Big Bang (Belatra Games)\n\nEmbark on a journey through floating planets, shooting stars, and satellites with Big Bang, the Belatra Games slot with a cascade system and a plethora of winning combinations.\n\nA journey through space\n\nPlaying Big Bang, the new Belatra Game slot, is like taking a trip through the cosmos. The theme is, of course, space, albeit a little different from what we know. We find ourselves on a desert planet, with the playing grid set in a rock hollow while in the background, rocks are suspended in mid-air against a night sky from which vertical stars fall.\n\nThe graphics are of excellent quality, with bright colors and well-designed symbols. The main buttons, of large dimensions, are positioned at the bottom, while those for secondary settings are smaller and located at the top left, leaving ample space for the playing grid.\n\nFeatures of Big Bang\n\nThe playing grid has a square shape, with 8 reels and 8 rows and a maximum win of 5,000 times the bet in a single game. The system is a cluster, meaning that winning combinations do not have to be linear but can also be in groups. Each winning combination then activates the classic cascade mechanism, whereby paying symbols are removed and replaced by entirely new ones.\n\nThe game can be set through some functions such as Autoplay and Turbo mode, which speeds up the fall of symbols making the game faster.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player is 96.11%, while the volatility is medium.\n\nA special Wild/Scatter\n\nIn Big Bang, there are only six thematic symbols. To be precise, you won't find the classic playing cards that are in almost all slots, but only stars and planets: Earth, Mars, Venus, Neptune, the moon, and the sun.\n\nTo win, it is necessary to create clusters of at least 5 symbols up to 25 and more.\n\nThe special symbol is the black hole, which is both Wild and Scatter. In the first case, it replaces all other symbols and is accompanied by a multiplier, initially x1. Following a winning combo, before the other new symbols fall, the Wild will move to a free position and increase the multiplier by x1. If there are multiple wilds, the relative multipliers are multiplied together. When multiple black holes are adjacent, a single large Wild of size 2×2 or 3×3 will be formed. Following the winning combo, the large symbol divides into smaller symbols that will occupy the positions freed by the paying symbols. Larger planet symbols can occur randomly or when the Planet Rain function is activated.\n\nThe black hole in its Scatter function earns three Free Spins when it appears three times; during the free spins, the special symbol will remain on the screen until the end of the bonus game.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the volatility of Big Bang?\n\nThe volatility is medium, with an excellent balance between the frequency of plays and sums awarded. This means that you win neither high nor low amounts with good frequency.\n\nCan I play Big Bang on a tablet?\n\nAbsolutely yes, this game is created with HTML5 architecture, suitable for any portable device.\n\nCan I try the game without spending money?\n\nOf course, on our website, you are offered the possibility to test Big Bang in Demo mode entirely free of charge.\n            ",

The playing grid is 8 reels by 8 rows and has a maximum win of 5,000 times the bet in a single round. The game can be played using various settings such as Autoplay and Turbo mode, which speeds up the pace of play. The theoretical return to the player is 96.11%, while the volatility is medium.\n\nTheme and Visuals\n\nBig Bang's theme is space, featuring floating planets, shooting stars, and satellites which transport players to a desert planet where the playing grid is set in a rock hollow while rocks are suspended in mid-air against a night sky from which vertical stars fall. The graphics are excellent, with bright colors and well-designed symbols. The main buttons are positioned at the bottom of the screen, while secondary settings are located at the top left, leaving ample space for the playing grid.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nBig Bang has only six thematic symbols, featuring the planets Earth, Mars, Venus, Neptune, the moon, and the sun. Players can win by creating clusters of at least 5 symbols, up to 25 or more. The black hole is a special symbol in this game, which acts as both Wild and Scatter. It replaces all other symbols and is accompanied by a multiplier, initially x1. Following a winning combo, the Wild will move to a free position and increase the multiplier by x1. If there are multiple wilds, the relative multipliers are multiplied together. When multiple black holes are adjacent, a single large Wild of size 2×2 or 3×3 is formed. Larger planet symbols can occur randomly or when the Planet Rain function is activated. In its Scatter function, the black hole triggers three Free Spins when it appears three times; during the free spins, the special symbol will remain on the screen until the end of the bonus game.\n\nWinning Combinations\n\nTo win in Big Bang, players need to create clusters of at least 5 symbols up to 25 or more. The cascade mechanism means that winning combinations do not have to be linear but can also be in groups. Each winning combination then activates the classic cascade mechanism, whereby paying symbols are removed and replaced by entirely new ones. Players can win up to 5,000 times the bet in a single round when playing Big Bang.\n\nReturn to Player\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) for Big Bang is 96.11%, which is a decent percentage, ensuring that players get a fair chance to win their bets with good frequency. The game's volatility is medium, meaning that players can expect to have a balanced gaming experience, with neither high nor low amounts won with good frequency.\n\n        \n            ",

The theme is, of course, space, albeit a little different from what we know. We find ourselves on a desert planet, with the playing grid set in a rock hollow while in the background, rocks are suspended in mid-air against a night sky from which vertical stars fall.\n\nThe graphics are of excellent quality, with bright colors and well-designed symbols. The main buttons, of large dimensions, are positioned at the bottom, while those for secondary settings are smaller and located at the top left, leaving ample space for the playing grid.\n\nFeatures of Big Bang\n\nThe playing grid has a square shape, with 8 reels and 8 rows and a maximum win of 5,000 times the bet in a single game. The system is a cluster, meaning that winning combinations do not have to be linear but can also be in groups. Each winning combination then activates the classic cascade mechanism, whereby paying symbols are removed and replaced by entirely new ones.\n\nThe game can be set through some functions such as Autoplay and Turbo mode, which speeds up the fall of symbols making the game faster.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player is 96.11%, while the volatility is medium.\n\nA special Wild/Scatter\n\nIn Big Bang, there are only six thematic symbols. To be precise, you won't find the classic playing cards that are in almost all slots, but only stars and planets: Earth, Mars, Venus, Neptune, the moon, and the sun.\n\nTo win, it is necessary to create clusters of at least 5 symbols up to 25 and more.\n\nThe special symbol is the black hole, which is both Wild and Scatter. In the first case, it replaces all other symbols and is accompanied by a multiplier, initially x1. Following a winning combo, before the other new symbols fall, the Wild will move to a free position and increase the multiplier by x1. If there are multiple wilds, the relative multipliers are multiplied together. When multiple black holes are adjacent, a single large Wild of size 2×2 or 3×3 will be formed. Following the winning combo, the large symbol divides into smaller symbols that will occupy the positions freed by the paying symbols. Larger planet symbols can occur randomly or when the Planet Rain function is activated.\n\nThe black hole in its Scatter function earns three Free Spins when it appears three times; during the free spins, the special symbol will remain on the screen until the end of the bonus game.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the volatility of Big Bang?\n\nThe volatility is medium, with an excellent balance between the frequency of plays and sums awarded. This means that you win neither high nor low amounts with good frequency.\n\nCan I play Big Bang on a tablet?\n\nAbsolutely yes, this game is created with HTML5 architecture, suitable for any portable device.\n\nCan I try the game without spending money?\n\nOf course, on our website, you are offered the possibility to test Big Bang in Demo mode entirely free of charge.\n            ",
