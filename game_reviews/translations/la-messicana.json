In this brief review we will look at its features to provide a precise picture of the title in question.\n\nLa Messicana: a festive atmosphere?\n\nLet's start by talking about the graphics and sound. We are dealing with a slot game with twilight tones insofar as the whole thing is set at night. Both the background and the symbols that find themselves within the game grid reproduce the colors of dark blue and purple.\n\nThese are divided into allusions to the festival of the dead (such as the candle and face painting) and other typically Mexican elements, such as the guitar of the mariachi.\n\nAnd it is precisely this instrument that accompanies our various plays, albeit covered by game sounds that are much more pronounced than the background melody.\n\nOverall, we are dealing with a slot game with an interesting and tastefully developed theme, whose illustrations do not detract from the gameplay, which we will talk about in the next point.\n\nLa Messicana: Choose the skull\n\nAnyone who has tried a title from Cristaltec will know that, in technical terms, the slot games from this development house generally follow very similar standards to each other. In this case, we are faced with a title with an RTP equal to 95.08%, whose volatility is medium.\n\nThe game grid is of the 5*3 type, like most online slots, and during the game, it will be important to keep an eye on the value of the winnings, as it is possible to obtain a large number of winning combinations but of low value, which could still lead to an unnoticed drop in our game balance.\n\nAmong the special symbols we find the Moon, which plays the role of the Wild symbol and can replace any other normal symbol in the game, and the title of the slot itself, which is a Scatter symbol.\n\nBy finding at least three symbols that bear the title of the slot \"La Messicana\" we will be given the opportunity to choose one of the five colored skulls (with more symbols we will have more attempts) that will conceal a random win.\n\nSimilar slots to La Messicana\n\nSticking with the Mexican theme, if we want to look for other slots with the same \"flavor,\" we could recommend Sweet Chilli Electric Cash. If instead, we want to try titles that share the same gameplay mechanics, it is certainly possible to browse the Cristaltec catalog, with slots such as Incas Return, Fever, Ork, and Malice.\n            ",

The game is filled with typical Mexican elements and colors reproduced in dark blue and purple tones.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nLa Messicana features illustrations that add to the gaming experience without detracting from it. The game is set at night, and the symbols and background reproduce the colors typical of the festival of the dead. The game is accompanied by a melody that is overshadowed by pronounced sound effects.\n\nGameplay\n\nLa Messicana is of the 5x3 type, and its RTP of 95.08% is medium volatile. During gameplay, players should keep an eye on their winnings, as they could be of low value and lead to an unnoticed drop in their game balance. The game features a Moon symbol, which is the Wild, and can replace all other regular symbols. The La Messicana title symbol is the Scatter, and finding at least three will allow players to choose one of five colored skulls to reveal a random win.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nLa Messicana features symbols that allude to the festival of the dead, such as candles and face painting, as well as other typically Mexican elements like the guitar of the mariachi. The game's Wild symbol is the Moon, while the La Messicana title symbol is the Scatter. By finding at least three scatter symbols, players can choose one of five colored skulls that will reveal a random win.\n\nSimilar Slots\n\nFor those who enjoy Mexican-themed games, Sweet Chilli Electric Cash is another option besides La Messicana. Additionally, for those who prefer gameplay mechanics similar to La Messicana, Cristaltec offers slots such as Incas Return, Fever, Ork, and Malice.\n\n        \n            ",

In this brief review we will look at its features to provide a precise picture of the title in question.\n\nLa Messicana: a festive atmosphere?\n\nLet's start by talking about the graphics and sound. We are dealing with a slot game with twilight tones insofar as the whole thing is set at night. Both the background and the symbols that find themselves within the game grid reproduce the colors of dark blue and purple.\n\nThese are divided into allusions to the festival of the dead (such as the candle and face painting) and other typically Mexican elements, such as the guitar of the mariachi.\n\nAnd it is precisely this instrument that accompanies our various plays, albeit covered by game sounds that are much more pronounced than the background melody.\n\nOverall, we are dealing with a slot game with an interesting and tastefully developed theme, whose illustrations do not detract from the gameplay, which we will talk about in the next point.\n\nLa Messicana: Choose the skull\n\nAnyone who has tried a title from Cristaltec will know that, in technical terms, the slot games from this development house generally follow very similar standards to each other. In this case, we are faced with a title with an RTP equal to 95.08%, whose volatility is medium.\n\nThe game grid is of the 5*3 type, like most online slots, and during the game, it will be important to keep an eye on the value of the winnings, as it is possible to obtain a large number of winning combinations but of low value, which could still lead to an unnoticed drop in our game balance.\n\nAmong the special symbols we find the Moon, which plays the role of the Wild symbol and can replace any other normal symbol in the game, and the title of the slot itself, which is a Scatter symbol.\n\nBy finding at least three symbols that bear the title of the slot \"La Messicana\" we will be given the opportunity to choose one of the five colored skulls (with more symbols we will have more attempts) that will conceal a random win.\n\nSimilar slots to La Messicana\n\nSticking with the Mexican theme, if we want to look for other slots with the same \"flavor,\" we could recommend Sweet Chilli Electric Cash. If instead, we want to try titles that share the same gameplay mechanics, it is certainly possible to browse the Cristaltec catalog, with slots such as Incas Return, Fever, Ork, and Malice.\n            ",
