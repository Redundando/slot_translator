This 5 reel, 20 pay line free online slot is part of Playson's \"Timeless Fruit Slots\" collection. And as the name suggests, there are a lot of fruits and jokers to discover while spinning the reels on a scarlet red background without any soundtrack. Is the slot game Fruits & Jokers: 100 lines worth a trip back in time? Let's see what our reviewers think. \n\nGameplay and Main Features\n\nYou can start playing the Fruits & Jokers: 100 lines online slot game with a minimum bet of €0.20 up to a maximum bet of €100, a perfect option for players with a low budget or are new to the game. The slot has 20 fixed pay lines, which are only paid in succession from left to right. This is an upgrade from a traditional fruit slot, where we are used to seeing much fewer pay lines, sometimes even less than five. At the bottom of the game box, you will find an autoplay button that can be adjusted up to 999 spins, increasing the speed through the quick spin mode that speeds up the wheel's rhythm. \n\nWatch out for the All-Fruit Symbols and the Wild\n\nThe available symbols are quite simple:\nCherries, Lemons, and Oranges pay the minimum,\nGrapes, Watermelons, and Lucky 7s are the highest paying symbols.\nThe Wild symbol is represented by Joker, the key character of the game, that can replace any other symbol except the Scatter. It is a generous symbol, rewarding with x15 the bet when 5 of it land on a pay line.\nGolden Star: This symbol is definitely the item to look for, as it offers a bet of 400x when five of it appear anywhere on the screen.\n\nNote: In this online slot, there are no free spins to collect, and no jackpots, a Playson choice to make the gameplay as faithful as possible to vintage fruit slots of the past. However, you can benefit from an RTP of 96.46% with medium volatility that allows extending the game with small and frequent wins. \n\nPlay Fruits & Jokers: 100 lines from any mobile device, even with real money, to experience the fun of this slot and take advantage of the welcome bonuses and many deposit bonuses from various online providers. In our gaming catalog, you will also find the colorful slot Super Burning Wins, also by Playson, which is one of the most entertaining nostalgia games online.\n        ",
