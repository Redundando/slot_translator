The game boasts of a bonus feature, and free spins are activated by landing three or more Book symbols, which represent scatter. An unusual feature of the game is wild and scatter symbols represented by the same symbol, the Book of the Dead. The Book of the Dead triggers the main bonus feature, which includes a free spin round. The gambling feature allows you to double your winnings by predicting the next color or suit of playing cards.\n\nGraphics and visualization\n\nThe Book of Dead slot game takes inspiration from ancient Egypt, featuring excellently illustrated symbols that represent objects used by ancient Egyptians. With high-quality graphics, players can enjoy the beautiful design elements put into creating a visually stunning game.\n\nPaylines and betting options\n\nBook of Dead offers ten paylines with bets starting from just €0.01 up to €100. The minimum bet is perfect for beginners looking to explore the game with minimal risk, while high rollers can bet up to €100 per spin.\n\nReturn To Player (RTP)\n\nWith an RTP of 96.21%, this Book of Dead slot game offers a good player return rate. The maximum amount that can be won is a multiplier of x1,000.\n\nSpecial symbols\n\nBook of Dead includes high-value symbols such as Anubis and other Egyptian deities. The game features wild and scatter symbols of the same sign, represented by the Book of the Dead itself. This symbol triggers the game's main bonus feature; the free spin round awards ten free spins, and a random symbol is selected as an expanding icon that covers all positions on the reels, resulting in a win if a combination is possible. The game's gambling feature allows you to double or even quadruple your winnings.\n\nComparison to similar games in the same genre\n\nBook of Dead shares a common ancient Egypt theme with other games such as the popular Book of Ra produced by Novomatic, which is available both online and as a bar slot. However, Book of Dead exhibits special features such as wild and scatter symbols represented by the same symbol, and the main bonus feature where a randomly selected icon expands to cover the entire reel, resulting in a win if a combination is possible. Book of Dead is also playable with a wide range of betting options, starting at just €0.01 per spin, making it ideal for both beginners and high rollers.\n\n        \n            ",
