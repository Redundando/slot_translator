A questi si aggiungono gli immancabili simboli del Poker.\nComplessivamente, la grafica è piacevole, accompagnata da un sottofondo musicale di tensione, come di attesa per il conflitto.

The graphics of the game present us with a classic window with a view of the sea. The game symbols include recognizable characters such as Leonidas, the Oracle, and the traitor, along with swords, shields, and lances, as well as the inevitable symbols of poker. The visuals are accompanied by tense background music, which adds to the atmosphere of the game.\n\nSpecial Symbols and Functions\n\nThe special symbols in the game are two. The Shield is the game's scatter, and when 2 to 5 scatters are displayed, additional prizes are awarded. Leonidas is the wild symbol, which can cover up to 3 boxes on the same reel. The special functions of the game include 20 free spins, which are obtained by displaying 3 or more scatters in the same spin, with a x4 multiplier. Additionally, the betting game can be activated after each winning simple spin, where the prize can be doubled up to 10 times, by beating the dealer's card, choosing yours among 4 different cards.\n\nRTP and Betting Limits\n\nThe game's RTP percentage is about 96%. The minimum bet is 0.01€, and the maximum bet is 100€ per spin.

Well, the slot game Almighty Sparta takes us right there, to that era and places of the battle.\nProduced by Endorphina, Almighty Sparta features 10 paylines on a 3×5 display. As we will see in this article, this slot also has a special symbols free spin function.\nSlot machine graphics\nThe graphics of Almighty Sparta put us in front of a sort of classic window overlooking the sea, the famous cliff where the Persians landed and where they initially found a stormy sea that caused some of their ships to crash on the rocks.\nAmong the symbols we find, besides the great Leonidas, also the oracle (the woman), the traitor (although it doesn't seem so from the figure) who betrayed Leonidas, swords, lances, shields and the Persian king. To these we add the inevitable symbols of Poker.\nOverall, the graphics are pleasing, accompanied by a tense background music, as if waiting for the conflict. In fact, as we'll see shortly, something is unleashed.\nFunctions and bonuses of Almighty Sparta slot\nThe special symbols of the slot game are two:\n\nShield, which represents the game scatter. If 2 to 5 scatters are displayed on the screen in a same spin, even in any order, additional prizes are obtained.\nLeonidas, the wild symbol of the game. This can appear covering up to 3 boxes on the same reel.\n\nThe special functions of Almighty Sparta slot are two\n\nFree spins: by displaying 3 or more scatters (shields) in a same spin, 20 free spins with a x4 multiplier are obtained. More free spins can be won during the free games.\nGamble: the betting game can be activated after each winning simple spin. Your prize can be doubled up to 10 times. To do so, you must beat the dealer's card, choosing yours among 4 different cards.\n\nEvaluation of Almighty Sparta slot\nIt's a nice slot game, no doubt about it. Enjoyable like the other slots produced by Endorphina that we've reviewed before, but with an extra touch. Indeed, in Almighty Sparta slot there are two different special symbols, not just one scatter/wild symbol. Moreover, the free spins are 20 instead of 10. The visual style is relaxing and immersive at the same time. The audio lowers the war atmosphere and you are free to turn it on or off from the options (the three lines on the left of the screen).\nThe RTP percentage of Almighty Sparta slot is about 96%. The minimum bet is 0.01€, the maximum is 100€ per spin. As experienced gamblers, we can appreciate the balance of risk and reward, the seamless gameplay, and the attention to details in this slot game.
