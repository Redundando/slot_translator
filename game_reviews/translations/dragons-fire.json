Il range di scommesse va da un minimo di 0,20 fino a un massimo di 10 monete, il che rende Dragon’s Fire una slot machine adatta a tutti coloro che non vogliono investire nel gioco grandi capitali.\nLa vincita massima può arrivare fino a 10.000 volte l’importo della puntata, e la si ottiene quando l’intera schermata è occupata dai simboli dell’occhio del drago (Dragon’s Eye), che prevedono un moltiplicatore altissimo di ben x50.\nAl contrario di altre slot machine della Red Tiger Gaming, Dragon’s Fire offre un ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player) accettabile, che si attesta su un canonico 96,07%, in linea con la maggior parte degli altri giochi di slot.\nDragon’s Fire è disponibile in formato HTML5, il che la rende giocabile non solo da computer desktop ma anche dalla maggior parte dei dispositivi mobili sia Android che iOS.\nÈ inoltre disponibile la funzione Autoplay, che permette di giocare fino a 100 giri in modalità automatica.\n\nSimboli e funzionalità speciali di Dragon’s Fire\nDragon’s Fire presenta dieci simboli che possono apparire sia singolarmente che in cluster di due o quattro. Abbiamo quattro uova di drago di diversi colori, giallo, blu, rosso e verde, che rappresentano i simboli con valore inferiore; quelli di valore medio sono dei piccoli draghi degli stessi colori delle uova mentre i simboli dell’occhio di drago e il jolly sono quelli che pagano di più.\nUn minimo di tre Scatter, in qualsiasi posizione sui rulli, attiva la funzione Free Spins, che regala fino a 20 giri gratuiti in cui si può usufruire anche di ricchi moltiplicatori.\nAltri moltiplicatori si possono ottenere quando sulla schermata di gioco, in seguito a una vincita di qualsiasi entità, appare un uovo di drago rosso.\nIn conclusione, crediamo che Dragon’s Fire sia una slot che vale la pena giocare, sia per la grafica davvero strabiliante, sia, soprattutto, per le ottime possibilità di portare a casa ricchi premi!\n",

When you open Dragon's Fire, you'll be immersed in a stunning fantasy setting with crisp graphics and expertly crafted animations and special effects. Red Tiger Game is on par with other highly acclaimed software houses!\n\nFounded in 2014, Red Tiger Gaming aims to offer a high-quality gaming experience, and thanks to this feature, its products have quickly made their way into the industry and are now available in most online casinos, involving an increasing number of players. All Red Tiger Gaming games can boast original and innovative gameplay mechanics, and top-level graphics with both 2D and 3D animations that provide gaming enthusiasts with a truly engaging experience that will delight even the most demanding players!\n\nMain features of the slot\nPlayers are tasked with facing the majestic fire-breathing dragon on a game screen consisting of five reels, four rows, and 40 pay lines. The betting range goes from a minimum of 0.20 up to a maximum of 10 coins, making Dragon's Fire a slot machine suitable for those who do not want to invest large amounts of money. The maximum win can reach up to 10,000 times the amount of the bet, which is obtained when the entire screen is filled with Dragon's Eye symbols that provide an incredibly high multiplier of x50.\n\nUnlike other Red Tiger Gaming slot machines, Dragon's Fire offers an acceptable theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.07%, in line with most other slot games. Dragon's Fire is available in HTML5 format, making it playable not only on desktop computers but also on most Android and iOS mobile devices. The Autoplay function is also available, allowing you to play up to 100 spins in automatic mode.\n\nSymbols and special features of Dragon's Fire\nDragon's Fire features ten symbols that can appear individually or in clusters of two or four. We have four dragon eggs of different colors, yellow, blue, red, and green, which represent the lower-value symbols; the medium-value ones are small dragons of the same colors as the eggs, while the Dragon's Eye symbols and the wilds are the ones that pay the most.\n\nA minimum of three scatters, in any position on the reels, activates the Free Spins function, which gives up to 20 free spins where you can also enjoy rich multipliers. Other multipliers can be obtained when a red dragon egg appears on the game screen after any win.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that Dragon's Fire is a slot machine that is worth playing, not just for its stunning graphics but especially for the excellent chances of winning big prizes!\n        ",
