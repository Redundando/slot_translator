            "prompt": "\nBelow is a review of the game \"Betty Bonkers\".\n\nPlease provide an FAQ:\n\n- 8 questions\n- Use simple language and provide practical takeaways.\n- Respond with a JSON!\n- Use the key \"faq\" and an array with the keys \"question\" and \"answer\". \n\nReview: Betty Bonkers\n\nThe early 1960s in Las Vegas was an iconic period, and Quickspin wanted to recreate that magical atmosphere through the retro design and exciting features of the Betty Bonkers slot machine. Here, you can find a complete review that includes RTP, volatility, demos, bets, paylines, and jackpots. So be sure to read it until the end!\n\nGameplay and Jackpot of the Free Slot Betty Bonkers\n\nBetty Bonkers is a 3x3 slot with only five fixed paylines. In addition, you can activate various features and bonuses, including fantastic jackpots. The bet in Betty Bonkers ranges from €0.1 to €100, and it can influence your winnings.\n\nThe RTP is 96.10% with high volatility. Additionally, there is a maximum win of 10,467 times the stake. With a wide variety of features in Betty Bonkers, to obtain the maximum win, you must satisfy various conditions, one of which is to get Mega Free Spins and reach 10 times the Bonkers line multiplier. This multiplier is applied to the jackpots, transforming the first prize of 1,000x into 10,000x.\n\nJackpot of Betty Bonkers\n\nIn Betty Bonkers, the Jackpot bonus provides the following prizes:\n\nMini - 10 times the bet\nMed - 100 times the stake\nMax - 1,000 times the stake.\n\nSymbolism and Design of the Online Slot Betty Bonkers\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction of this review, the design is very showy and reminiscent of the exciting nightlife of Las Vegas. By activating the Free Spins function, you will also participate in an exclusive party with exceptional graphics, set against a backdrop that alternates between jazz tracks and melodies from the 1960s.\n\nAt the symbol level, however, in Betty Bonkers, I did not detect anything outstanding. On the reels, there are:\n\nClassic low-value fruits such as lemon, plum, and cherry with 1x, 2x, and 3x the stake;\nMedium-value icons such as the bell, Bar, and 7, which release 5x, 8x, and 15x the bet.\n\nThe Wild is a special symbol that replaces other symbols on paylines except Scatters. And guarantees 30 times the stake. The bonus symbol is the Scatter that can activate other functions that we will see in a moment.\n\nHow to Activate Bonus Spins, Jackpots, and Multipliers in Betty Bonkers\n\nFree Spins\n\nWith 2 Scatters on the board, you can win 1 free spin, 1 Bonkers multiplier, and 1 function from the Betty menu, which I will explain later;\n\nMega Free Spins\n\nAfter obtaining 3 Scatters, Betty Bonkers rewards you with 20 FS. During this feature, every time you get a win on the Bonkers Line Multiplier, you receive an extra free spin and 1 function from Betty Menu;\n\nBonkers Line Multiplier\n\nOn the left side of the reels, the Bonkers line multiplier appears when free spins are triggered. With every win during the bonus game, it increases by 1x and can reach 10x.\n\nBetty Bonkers Menu Features\n\nThe Betty menu has 6 different bonuses that you can win when you get a win on the multiplier line:\n\nSymbol Removal Spin\nWild Spin\nMultiplier Spin\nLink Spin\nBonkers jackpot\nFree Spins.\n\nFinally, the Buy option cannot be missing, where you can get a sufficient number of Scatters using the purchase option, 20 times the bet, which guarantees 2 Scatters on the reels, or 300 times the bet that shows 3 Scatters on the board.\n\nFor any information related to the six bonuses mentioned above, I suggest consulting the Betty Bonkers slot paytable.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are the strengths of the Betty Bonkers slot machine?\n\nMagnificent graphics and design, a wide range of features, and gigantic multipliers.\n\nWhat is the most profitable symbol in the Betty Bonkers fruit slot?\n\nThe most valuable symbol is Wild with 30 times the bet.\n\nIs the developer Quickspin reliable?\n\nSure, and it continues to expand to reach more players within the ADM / AAMS casinos on our list. If you feel like it, take a look at the latest releases, Scatter Monsters, Cash Truck Xmas Delivery, and Raven Rising.\n            ",
