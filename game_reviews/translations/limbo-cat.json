Ma attenzione: per apprezzarla davvero è bene non avere alcun tipo di pregiudizio, perché la struttura di questa macchinetta non ha nulla a che vedere con i titoli tradizionali. Non ci sono Wild, non ci sono simboli o icone a tema, non ci sono funzionalità extra: tutto è rappresentato da un’animazione continua, sulla quale è possibile andare a puntare in base alle proprie sensazioni del momento. A sviluppare questa slot è Onlyplay, un provider che ci ha abituato a soluzioni di gioco a distanza davvero particolari e inaspettate per diversi aspetti. Primo tra tutti per struttura di gioco. Limbo Cat è stata lanciata nel novembre 2020 e ci porta alla guida di un carro armato e rischi di esplosioni che possono compromettere le vincite che ottieni.\nMa scopriamo da vicino come funziona la slot con un RTP al 95%!\nLa grafica della slot Limbo Cat\nBè, a livello grafico è difficile definire la slot: è un approccio davvero strano. Non ci sono sfondi a tema, non ci sono griglie di gioco, rulli o linee di pagamento. Ti trovi di fronte a uno schermo molto semplice con una grafica retrò dove puoi gestire le tue scommesse. In altro a sinistra trovi l’animazione del carro armato, che dovrai utilizzare come riferimento per decidere quando scommettere e quando ritirare le tue vincite.\nLimbo Cat prevede un jackpot cumulativo, con la possibilità di aumentare le vincite grazie a un moltiplicatore e bonus speciali che si sbloccano con aumento istantaneo man mano che il carro armato passa vicino a una serie di scatole in legno. Attenzione però, perché oltre alle scatole moltiplicatrici ci sono anche quelle che contengono delle bombe, pronte a far esplodere il carro e quindi compromettere il gioco.\nNon ti aspettare altre sorprese o colpi di scena, non ci sono giri gratuiti degni di questo nome: il meccanismo è semplice e si ripete nel tempo fino a quando non ti ritieni soddisfatto delle vincite che hai ottenuto. Ciò che colpisce però è questa sua innovazione che non si presenta attraverso design o gameplay, ma proprio per struttura e modalità di gioco.\nConsiderazioni finali su Limbo Cat\nSe la grafica non è il suo forte, la slot recupera sicuramente per idea e originalità. Viene associata a uno speciale jackpot cumulativo che aumenta proprio lungo il percorso del carro. Sei pronto a correre il rischio e metterti alla prova per scoprire fino a che punto vorrai spingerti?\nPuoi trovare la scatola bonus e arrivare a un massimo valore di vincita di 10.000x, ma attenzione a non osare troppo perché la tua fortuna potrebbe improvvisamente saltare.\n",

This game is a world of its own, one that can surprise even the most experienced gamblers out there. But be warned, to truly appreciate the game, you need to leave your preconceived notions at the door because this slot has nothing in common with traditional titles. There are no Wilds, no themed symbols, and no extra features - everything is conveyed through a continuous animation that you can bet on based on your gut feelings. Onlyplay, the developer behind this slot, is known for offering some unique and unexpected remote gaming solutions, starting with the game structure. Limbo Cat was launched in November 2020 and puts you in the driver's seat of a tank, taking risks of explosions that can threaten your winnings.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how this slot with RTP of 95% operates!\n\nGraphics of Limbo Cat\nTo describe the graphics of this slot is a bit tricky as it is a very unconventional approach. There are no themed backgrounds, no game grids, reels, or paylines. Instead, you are greeted with a simple screen with retro graphics where you can manage your bets. In the top left corner, there's an animation of the tank that you will use as a reference point to decide when to bet and when to withdraw your winnings. Limbo Cat features a cumulative jackpot, with the possibility of increasing your winnings thanks to a multiplier and special bonuses that unlock as the tank passes near a series of wooden boxes. But beware, in addition to the multiplier boxes, there are also those that contain bombs, ready to blow up the tank and compromise the game.\n\nDon't expect any more surprises or twists; there are no free spins worth mentioning - the mechanism is simple and repeats itself until you're satisfied with your winnings.

It's not just about design or gameplay; it's about the game structure and playing mode itself.\n\nFinal thoughts on Limbo Cat\nIf graphics aren't the game's strong point, Limbo Cat undoubtedly makes up for it in terms of idea and originality. It's associated with a unique cumulative jackpot that grows along the tank's route. Are you ready to take a risk and test your luck to see how far you can go?

This game is a world of its own, one that can surprise even the most experienced gamblers out there. But be warned, to truly appreciate the game, you need to leave your preconceived notions at the door because this slot has nothing in common with traditional titles. There are no Wilds, no themed symbols, and no extra features - everything is conveyed through a continuous animation that you can bet on based on your gut feelings. Onlyplay, the developer behind this slot, is known for offering some unique and unexpected remote gaming solutions, starting with the game structure. Limbo Cat was launched in November 2020 and puts you in the driver's seat of a tank, taking risks of explosions that can threaten your winnings.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how this slot with RTP of 95% operates!\n\nGraphics of Limbo Cat\nTo describe the graphics of this slot is a bit tricky as it is a very unconventional approach. There are no themed backgrounds, no game grids, reels, or paylines. Instead, you are greeted with a simple screen with retro graphics where you can manage your bets. In the top left corner, there's an animation of the tank that you will use as a reference point to decide when to bet and when to withdraw your winnings. Limbo Cat features a cumulative jackpot, with the possibility of increasing your winnings thanks to a multiplier and special bonuses that unlock as the tank passes near a series of wooden boxes. But beware, in addition to the multiplier boxes, there are also those that contain bombs, ready to blow up the tank and compromise the game.\n\nDon't expect any more surprises or twists; there are no free spins worth mentioning - the mechanism is simple and repeats itself until you're satisfied with your winnings. What stands out about Limbo Cat, however, is its innovation. It's not just about design or gameplay; it's about the game structure and playing mode itself.\n\nFinal thoughts on Limbo Cat\nIf graphics aren't the game's strong point, Limbo Cat undoubtedly makes up for it in terms of idea and originality. It's associated with a unique cumulative jackpot that grows along the tank's route. Are you ready to take a risk and test your luck to see how far you can go? You can find the bonus box and reach a maximum win of 10,000x, but be careful not to push too hard, or your luck might suddenly run out.\n            ",

The game structure is unconventional, with no reels or paylines, and everything is conveyed through a continuous animation. Players need to manage their bets by deciding when to bet and when to withdraw their winnings based on the tank's movement. The game is simple and repeats itself until the player is satisfied with their winnings.\n\nRTP\n\nThe RTP of Limbo Cat is 95%, which is average for a slot game. However, the game's unique structure and gameplay make it worth a try for those looking for something different.\n\nBonuses\n\nLimbo Cat features a cumulative jackpot, which grows along the tank's route. Players can increase their winnings through a multiplier and special bonuses that unlock when the tank passes near a series of wooden boxes. However, players must be careful because some boxes contain bombs, which can blow up the tank and compromise the game. There are no free spins in this game.\n\nJackpot\n\nLimbo Cat features a unique cumulative jackpot that grows along the tank's route. Players can reach a maximum win of 10,000x by finding the bonus box. However, players must also be cautious not to push their luck too far, or they risk losing everything they've won.\n\nGraphics\n\nLimbo Cat's graphics are unconventional, with no themed backgrounds, game grids, reels or paylines. Players are greeted with a simple screen with retro graphics where they manage their bets. The top left corner features an animation of the tank, providing players with reference for their bets. While the graphics may not be the game's strong point, the game's innovation and originality more than make up for it.\n\n        \n            ",

This game is a world of its own, one that can surprise even the most experienced gamblers out there. But be warned, to truly appreciate the game, you need to leave your preconceived notions at the door because this slot has nothing in common with traditional titles. There are no Wilds, no themed symbols, and no extra features - everything is conveyed through a continuous animation that you can bet on based on your gut feelings. Onlyplay, the developer behind this slot, is known for offering some unique and unexpected remote gaming solutions, starting with the game structure. Limbo Cat was launched in November 2020 and puts you in the driver's seat of a tank, taking risks of explosions that can threaten your winnings.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how this slot with RTP of 95% operates!\n\nGraphics of Limbo Cat\nTo describe the graphics of this slot is a bit tricky as it is a very unconventional approach. There are no themed backgrounds, no game grids, reels, or paylines. Instead, you are greeted with a simple screen with retro graphics where you can manage your bets. In the top left corner, there's an animation of the tank that you will use as a reference point to decide when to bet and when to withdraw your winnings. Limbo Cat features a cumulative jackpot, with the possibility of increasing your winnings thanks to a multiplier and special bonuses that unlock as the tank passes near a series of wooden boxes. But beware, in addition to the multiplier boxes, there are also those that contain bombs, ready to blow up the tank and compromise the game.\n\nDon't expect any more surprises or twists; there are no free spins worth mentioning - the mechanism is simple and repeats itself until you're satisfied with your winnings. What stands out about Limbo Cat, however, is its innovation. It's not just about design or gameplay; it's about the game structure and playing mode itself.\n\nFinal thoughts on Limbo Cat\nIf graphics aren't the game's strong point, Limbo Cat undoubtedly makes up for it in terms of idea and originality. It's associated with a unique cumulative jackpot that grows along the tank's route. Are you ready to take a risk and test your luck to see how far you can go? You can find the bonus box and reach a maximum win of 10,000x, but be careful not to push too hard, or your luck might suddenly run out.\n            ",
