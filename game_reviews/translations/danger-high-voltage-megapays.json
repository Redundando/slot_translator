But if you love to play with changing bets and refine the value of your spins round after round, then you have found fertile ground. Danger High Voltage Megapays is an \"alternative\" title that comes from the idea of Big Time Gaming. It has an unusual game structure, or rather not the classic 5x3, but offers a 6x4 grid and four progressive jackpots to be won. It relies on high volatility (so to win big prizes, you will have to be patient) and an RTP of 96.39%. But the most important thing is that it presents 4096 ways to win.\n\nSlot Graphics and Features\n\nOn the background, an environment that definitely recalls a disco and in your ears a soundtrack that will make you want to get up and dance. Aesthetically we can say that the slot is well made and presents an original idea, inspired by the famous song of the same name released in 2002. And if you find the Scatter symbols on the reels, you'll hear the call of Fire in the Disco. In short, for theme and musical choices, the slot is a caress for all enthusiasts. But its extra functions are not to be underestimated.\n\nWhen you are in the base game, you will find 2 Wild symbols that can land on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. They can expand to cover the entire reel, but only one carries an x6 multiplier.\n\nBonus Game and Features\n\nThe player who manages to find 3 Scatters can choose between 7 free spins, with one of the table symbols transformed into a fixed Wild, or 15 spins with an expanding Wild that has a random multiplier ranging from x2 to x66. In both cases, you can win up to 1000 times the bet. But let's not forget the real reason that brings us here: the jackpots!\n\nWe have said that there are 4 progressive jackpots chosen with a random symbol: it is soon said, however, that if you gradually raise your bet, you can increase your chances of winning. Even if it is not certain that the jackpot will necessarily be activated. When a Megapays symbol is chosen, the reels start spinning and if you position Megapays on the grid, they will remain fixed until you increase the level of your jackpot. As soon as you make a spin without symbols, however, the bonus game ends and your chances of winning abruptly stop.\n\nFAQ: Answers to frequently asked questions\n\nWho is the provider of the Danger High Voltage Megapays slot?\n\nIn recent years, Big Time Gaming has made itself known for its slots rich in important winnings, unlocked over time and not immediately.\n\nHow can I win a jackpot?\n\nIt's just a matter of luck: from 4 to 7 special symbols, the Mini Jackpot is unlocked, from 8 to 11 the Midi, from 12 to 14 symbols the Major Jackpot and if you have more than 15 Megapays symbols, put your hand on the Mega Jackpot.\n\nCan I also play for free from my smartphone?\n\nOf course, the For Fun mode is also available from mobile devices so that you can test the slot before investing real money.\n            ",

But if you love to play with changing bets and refine the value of your spins round after round, then you have found fertile ground. Danger High Voltage Megapays is an \"alternative\" title that comes from the idea of Big Time Gaming. It has an unusual game structure, or rather not the classic 5x3, but offers a 6x4 grid and four progressive jackpots to be won. It relies on high volatility (so to win big prizes, you will have to be patient) and an RTP of 96.39%. But the most important thing is that it presents 4096 ways to win.\n\nSlot Graphics and Features\n\nOn the background, an environment that definitely recalls a disco and in your ears a soundtrack that will make you want to get up and dance. Aesthetically we can say that the slot is well made and presents an original idea, inspired by the famous song of the same name released in 2002. And if you find the Scatter symbols on the reels, you'll hear the call of Fire in the Disco. In short, for theme and musical choices, the slot is a caress for all enthusiasts. But its extra functions are not to be underestimated.\n\nWhen you are in the base game, you will find 2 Wild symbols that can land on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. They can expand to cover the entire reel, but only one carries an x6 multiplier.\n\nBonus Game and Features\n\nThe player who manages to find 3 Scatters can choose between 7 free spins, with one of the table symbols transformed into a fixed Wild, or 15 spins with an expanding Wild that has a random multiplier ranging from x2 to x66. In both cases, you can win up to 1000 times the bet. But let's not forget the real reason that brings us here: the jackpots!\n\nWe have said that there are 4 progressive jackpots chosen with a random symbol: it is soon said, however, that if you gradually raise your bet, you can increase your chances of winning. Even if it is not certain that the jackpot will necessarily be activated. When a Megapays symbol is chosen, the reels start spinning and if you position Megapays on the grid, they will remain fixed until you increase the level of your jackpot. As soon as you make a spin without symbols, however, the bonus game ends and your chances of winning abruptly stop.\n\nFAQ: Answers to frequently asked questions\n\nWho is the provider of the Danger High Voltage Megapays slot?\n\nIn recent years, Big Time Gaming has made itself known for its slots rich in important winnings, unlocked over time and not immediately.\n\nHow can I win a jackpot?\n\nIt's just a matter of luck: from 4 to 7 special symbols, the Mini Jackpot is unlocked, from 8 to 11 the Midi, from 12 to 14 symbols the Major Jackpot and if you have more than 15 Megapays symbols, put your hand on the Mega Jackpot.\n\nCan I also play for free from my smartphone?\n\nOf course, the For Fun mode is also available from mobile devices so that you can test the slot before investing real money.\n            ",
