In questo caso, con Cashpot Kegs si incontra una struttura abbastanza classica di gioco, che pone una griglia con i rulli al fianco di una serie di jackpot espressi, che permettono di sapere in anticipo quante monete servono per poter sbancare la slot. Di seguito andremo a considerare quali sono i punti di forza di una slot che nonostante un RTP di poco al di sotto delle media permette di tentare la vincita di una piccola fortuna.

In base a tale scelta potrà cambiare il valore del moltiplicatore, e il numero richiesto di Scatter per i giri gratis. Ma di questo parleremo nel prossimo capitolo.\nIn termini di grafica invece abbiamo davvero un look minimale, dato da icone semplici, con le immancabili carte da gioco e qualche simbolo speciale per i Bonus e per raccogliere stelle e monete che aumentano le chance di moltiplicare e vincere il jackpot.\nBonus game e funzionalità \nIl suo bonus game, che può anche essere acquistato in denaro, è la parte più interessante della slot, che nel gioco base non sembra offrire chissà qualche colpo di scena. Dovrai quindi avere un po’ di pazienza per ottenere i giri gratuiti oppure potrai investire il tuo denaro per acquistare la funzionalità. A questo punto hai 4 opzioni: la prima ti permette di avere i jolly x1 e il numero di giri gratis pari a 5 spin. Oppure potrai avere jolly con un moltiplicatore x2 e 7 giri; la terza opzione prevede 9 giri e un jolly con un moltiplicatore x3. Infine puoi ottenere 12 giri gratis e un jolly con un moltiplicatore x10. Ideale se vuoi tentare il grande colpo!\nOcchio alle monete d’oro!
