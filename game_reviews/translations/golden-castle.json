Questo set di rulli che funge da scudo di fronte al castello di pietra ha 6 bobine dove troverai diverse pietre preziose nel loro colore e dimensione. Questa ricerca di rulli è alimentata dalla meccanica Titanways che fa cadere i simboli, dove avrai la possibilità di giocare con giri gratuiti e diversi modificatori di rulli che potrebbero farti vincere fino a 20.000 volte la tua puntata.\nProva ad attraversare le mura del Castello d’Oro nel titolo di slot medievale prodotto da Fantasma chiamato Golden Castle Titanways. Questa affascinante slot machine utilizza l’innovativo motore Titanways, con pietre preziose che possono apparire come simboli di dimensioni 3×3. Le gemme più grandi possono essere schiacciate durante la loro discesa tramite la funzione Avalanche, mentre il gioco bonus è dotato di un moltiplicatore progressivo che può portarti a grandi premi. Inoltre, fai attenzione al simbolo speciale Ghost King, che trasformerà casualmente i simboli della griglia.\nUna grafica medievale e misteriosa\nUna figura dorata con leggere connotazioni indù siede sopra una griglia di gioco che mostra simboli di tutte le forme e dimensioni. C’è qualcosa di un po’ sinistro nel castello dove si svolge l’azione. Mi viene in mente la parola “tetro”, come un castello desolato su una collina dove un tempo avvenivano atti turpi, che domina una città dove nessuno osa menzionare il suo nome. Uno di quelli in cui un’occhiata casuale rivela ombre minacciose che si allontanano frettolosamente dalle finestre. La minaccia extra è fornita da una colonna sonora pesante, anche se tutto quell’oro che brilla attraverso le crepe nella pietra è un segno motivante.\nI giocatori possono fare una puntata sul loro dispositivo preferito, dal cellulare al desktop, selezionando una puntata appropriata da 20 centesimi a 50 euro per giro. Fantasma ha accoppiato il loro debutto Titanways slot con un modello matematico altamente volatile, e RTP che arriva in 2 forme rispettabili. Il primo è un valore predefinito del 96,34%, che sale al 97,12% quando viene attivata la funzione acquista. L’acquisto di giri gratuiti potrebbe anche essere allettante, dato che il gioco offre un premio superiore di 20.000 volte la tua puntata.\nPer quanto riguarda il sistema Titanways, che si svolge su una griglia disposta su 6×6, ciò che lo rende ‘unico’ è che i simboli atterrano in dimensioni di 1×1, 1×2, 1×3, 2×2, o 3×3. A confondere le cose c’è il fatto che tutti i simboli delle singole bobine (1×1, 1×2, 1×3) contano come un simbolo indipendentemente dalla dimensione. Altri, di dimensioni 2×2 o 3×3, sono valutati come un simbolo su ogni rullo che coprono. Vincere con Titanways è semplice, dato che hai bisogno di 3 o più simboli identici che atterrino adiacenti dal primo rullo in poi. I simboli stessi sono costituiti da varie pietre preziose che valgono da 1x per 6 di un tipo a 10x se si ottengono 6 diamanti.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nLa parte centrale della funzione Titanways sono i simboli di pagamento regolari che possono apparire in cinque dimensioni – 1×1, 1×2, 1×3, 2×2 e 3×3. Mentre l’altezza non ha alcun impatto sul valore della vincita, le due grandi dimensioni quadrate sono valutate come un simbolo in base alla bobina che coprono. Per esempio, l’atterraggio di una combinazione di simboli 1×2 e 2×2 su tutti e sei i rulli conta come un 6x. Solo quando due o più simboli corrispondenti atterrano sullo stesso rullo porterà a più combinazioni vincenti in base a quanti sono su ogni rullo.\nLa seconda parte della meccanica sono le Valanghe, ossia quella che gli americani chiamano Avalanche Mode. All’inizio di una sequenza di giri, un mix casuale di simboli di varie dimensioni cade dall’alto sui rulli. Qualsiasi combinazione vincente andrà in frantumi e scomparirà prima che nuovi simboli vadano a valanga negli spazi vuoti. Qualsiasi simbolo mega 2×2 o 3×3 schiaccerà i simboli sottostanti se ci sono dei vuoti parziali sotto di essi.\nL’atterraggio di uno o più simboli Ghost King grigi attiverà la funzione Wild Haunt. Ognuno di essi selezionerà un simbolo più grande di 1×1 e lo dividerà in singoli simboli 1×1, moltiplicando potenzialmente una vincita se fa parte di una combo. Casualmente, uno o più simboli divisi possono trasformarsi in simboli wild Ghost King dorati. Il Ghost King grigio che si innesca si trasformerà sempre in un wild una volta che il modificatore è stato applicato.\nRaccogliendo tre scatter nell’arco in cima ai rulli all’interno di una singola sequenza di spin, si attiveranno 10 Phantom Free Spins che possono essere riattivati indefinitamente. Durante la funzione, il moltiplicatore di vincita progressivo inizia a x1 e aumenta di x1 dopo ogni valanga vincente, senza limiti. Non si azzera tra i giri gratuiti. Il Re Fantasma può anche atterrare in qualsiasi giro gratuito e dividere simboli più grandi, avendo potenzialmente un impatto significativo sulle tue vincite.\nPer quelli impazienti tra noi del casinò e abbastanza fortunati da risiedere in un paese senza restrizioni, c’è una scorciatoia disponibile per portarti direttamente all’evento principale.

            "response": "Golden Castle\n\nFantasma takes us back to medieval times with their release of the slot game \"Golden Castle Titanways\". Set on a shield in front of a stone castle, the 6 reels offer a variety of precious stones in different colours and sizes. The game mechanics are powered by Titanways, allowing symbols to fall and giving players a chance to earn free spins and various reel modifiers that could lead to up to 20,000 times their wager.\n\nStep inside the walls of the Golden Castle in this medieval-themed slot game produced by Fantasma called Golden Castle Titanways. This captivating slot game uses the innovative Titanways engine, with precious stones appearing as symbols, some in a 3x3 size. The larger gems can be crushed during their descent, thanks to the Avalanche feature, while the bonus game comes with a progressive multiplier that could lead to big prizes. Additionally, players should watch out for the special Ghost King symbol that randomly transforms grid symbols.\n\nWith medieval and mysterious graphics, a golden figure with Hindu undertones sits above the game's grid, displaying symbols of all shapes and sizes. There's a sinister element to the castle where the action takes place, reminding one of a \"dark\" castle on a hill where unspeakable deeds occurred, overshadowing a town where no one dares to mention its name. It's one of those places where a casual glance reveals threatening shadows that quickly retreat from the windows. The extra threat is provided by a heavy soundtrack, although all that gold shining through the cracks in the stone is a motivating sign.\n\nPlayers can place a wager on their preferred device, from mobile to desktop, selecting an appropriate bet ranging from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin. Fantasma coupled their Titanways slot game debut with a highly volatile mathematical model and an RTP that comes in two respectable forms. The first is a default value of 96.34%, which increases to 97.12% when the buy feature is activated. The purchase of free spins could also be enticing, as the game offers a top prize of 20,000 times your bet.\n\nRegarding the Titanways system, which takes place on a grid arranged on a 6x6 basis, what makes it 'unique' is that symbols land in sizes of 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2, or 3x3. To confuse things, all symbols on individual reels (1x1, 1x2, 1x3) count as one symbol regardless of size. Others of sizes 2x2 or 3x3 are evaluated as one symbol on each reel they cover. Winning with Titanways is simple; you need three or more identical symbols to land adjacent from the first reel onwards. The symbols themselves consist of various precious stones which are valued from 1x for 6 of a kind to 10x if you get 6 diamonds.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe central part of the Titanways feature consists of regular paying symbols that can appear in five dimensions – 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2, and 3x3. While height has no impact on the value of the win, the two large square dimensions are valued as a symbol based on the reel they cover. For example, landing a combination of 1x2 and 2x2 symbols on all six reels counts as a 6x win. Only when two or more matching symbols land on the same reel does it lead to multiple winning combinations based on how many are on each reel.\n\nThe second part of the mechanic are the Avalanches, which is what the Americans call the Avalanche Mode. At the beginning of a sequence of spins, a random mix of symbols of various sizes falls from the top of the reels. Any winning combination will shatter and disappear before new symbols avalanche into the empty spaces. Any mega 2x2 or 3x3 symbol will crush the underlying symbols if there are partial gaps beneath them.\n\nLanding one or more grey Ghost King symbols will trigger the Wild Haunt feature. Each one will select a symbol larger than 1x1 and divide it into individual 1x1 symbols, potentially multiplying a win if it is part of a combo. Randomly, one or more of the split symbols can transform into golden Ghost King wild symbols. The triggered grey Ghost King will always transform into a wild once the modifier has been applied.\n\nCollecting three scatters in the arc at the top of the reels within a single sequence of spins will activate 10 Phantom Free Spins that can be reactivated indefinitely. During the feature, the progressive win multiplier starts at x1 and increases by x1 after each winning avalanche, with no limits. It does not reset between free spins. The Ghost King can also land in any free spin and split larger symbols, potentially having a significant impact on your winnings.\n\nFor impatient casino players fortunate enough to reside in a country without restrictions, there is a shortcut available to take you directly to the main event. Press the 'Buy Freespins' button at any time between spins in the base game, and you will be able to purchase a feature for 70 times your default bet.",

Solo quando due o più simboli corrispondenti atterrano sullo stesso rullo porterà a più combinazioni vincenti in base a quanti sono su ogni rullo.\nLa seconda parte della meccanica sono le Valanghe, ossia quella che gli americani chiamano Avalanche Mode. All’inizio di una sequenza di giri, un mix casuale di simboli di varie dimensioni cade dall’alto sui rulli. Qualsiasi combinazione vincente andrà in frantumi e scomparirà prima che nuovi simboli vadano a valanga negli spazi vuoti. Qualsiasi simbolo mega 2×2 o 3×3 schiaccerà i simboli sottostanti se ci sono dei vuoti parziali sotto di essi.\nL’atterraggio di uno o più simboli Ghost King grigi attiverà la funzione Wild Haunt. Ognuno di essi selezionerà un simbolo più grande di 1×1 e lo dividerà in singoli simboli 1×1, moltiplicando potenzialmente una vincita se fa parte di una combo. Casualmente, uno o più simboli divisi possono trasformarsi in simboli wild Ghost King dorati. Il Ghost King grigio che si innesca si trasformerà sempre in un wild una volta che il modificatore è stato applicato.\nRaccogliendo tre scatter nell’arco in cima ai rulli all’interno di una singola sequenza di spin, si attiveranno 10 Phantom Free Spins che possono essere riattivati indefinitamente. Durante la funzione, il moltiplicatore di vincita progressivo inizia a x1 e aumenta di x1 dopo ogni valanga vincente, senza limiti. Non si azzera tra i giri gratuiti. Il Re Fantasma può anche atterrare in qualsiasi giro gratuito e dividere simboli più grandi, avendo potenzialmente un impatto significativo sulle tue vincite.\nPer quelli impazienti tra noi del casinò e abbastanza fortunati da risiedere in un paese senza restrizioni, c’è una scorciatoia disponibile per portarti direttamente all’evento principale. Premi il pulsante ‘Buy Freespins’ in qualsiasi momento tra un giro e l’altro nel gioco base e sarai in grado di acquistare una funzione per 70 volte la tua puntata predefinita.\n\n        ",

                            "content": "Golden Castle\nFantasma takes us back to medieval times with the release of the Golden Castle Titanways slot game. This shield-like set of reels in front of the stone castle features 6 reels where you'll find different precious stones in their color and size. This reel quest is powered by the Titanways mechanic, which drops symbols where you'll have the chance to play with free spins and different reel modifiers that could make you win up to 20,000 times your bet.\nEnter the Golden Castle's walls in the medieval slot title produced by Fantasma called Golden Castle Titanways. This captivating slot machine uses the innovative Titanways engine, with precious stones that can appear as 3x3 symbols. The larger gems can be crushed during their descent through the Avalanche feature, while the bonus game has a progressive multiplier that can lead to big rewards. Additionally, watch out for the special Ghost King symbol, which will randomly transform symbols in the grid.\n\nA mysterious and medieval graphics\nA golden figure with slight Hindu connotations sits above a game grid showing symbols of all shapes and sizes. There is something slightly sinister about the castle where the action takes place. I think of the word \"grim\", like a desolate castle on a hill where wicked deeds were once done, overlooking a city where no one dares to mention its name. One of those where a casual glance reveals menacing shadows hurrying away from the windows. The extra threat is provided by a heavy soundtrack, but all that shining gold through the cracks in the stone is a motivating sign.\n\nPlayers can place a bet on their preferred device, from mobile to desktop, selecting an appropriate bet from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin. Fantasma has paired their Titanways slot debut with a highly volatile mathematical model, and RTP in 2 respectable forms. The first is a default value of 96.34%, which rises to 97.12% when the Buy feature is activated. Buying free spins could also be tempting, as the game offers a top prize of 20,000 times your bet.\n\nRegarding the Titanways system, which takes place on a grid arranged on 6x6, what makes it 'unique' is that symbols land in sizes of 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2, or 3x3. To further confuse matters, all symbols of individual reels (1x1, 1x2, 1x3) count as one symbol regardless of size. Others, of size 2x2 or 3x3, are valued as one symbol on each reel they cover. Winning with Titanways is simple, as you need 3 or more identical symbols to land adjacent from the first reel on. The symbols themselves are made up of various precious stones ranging from 1x for 6 of a kind to 10x if you get 6 diamonds.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe core of the Titanways function is the regular paying symbols that can appear in five dimensions - 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2, and 3x3. While height has no impact on the value of the win, the two larger square dimensions are valued as one symbol based on the reel they cover. For example, landing a combination of 1x2 and 2x2 symbols on all six reels counts as a 6x. Only when two or more matching symbols land on the same reel will it lead to more winning combinations based on how many are on each reel.\n\nThe second part of the mechanics is the Avalanches, which is what Americans call Avalanche Mode. At the start of a spin sequence, a random mix of various size symbols falls from above on the reels. Any winning combination will shatter and disappear before new symbols cascade into the empty spaces. Any 2x2 or 3x3 mega symbol will crush the underlying symbols if there are partial voids underneath them.\n\nLanding one or more gray Ghost King symbols will trigger the Wild Haunt feature. Each of them will select a larger symbol than 1x1 and divide it into single 1x1 symbols, potentially multiplying a win if it's part of a combo. Randomly, one or more split symbols can turn into golden Ghost King wild symbols. The triggering gray Ghost King will always turn into a wild once the modifier has been applied.\n\nCollecting three scatters in the arc at the top of the reels within a single spin sequence will trigger 10 Phantom Free Spins that can be reactivated indefinitely. During the feature, the progressive win multiplier starts at x1 and increases by x1 after every winning avalanche, without limits. It doesn't reset between free spins. The Ghost King can also land on any free spin and split larger symbols, potentially having a significant impact on your winnings.\n\nFor those impatient of us at the casino and fortunate enough to reside in a country without restrictions, there is a shortcut available to take you directly to the main event. Press the ‘Buy Freespins’ button anytime between spins in the base game and you'll be able to purchase a feature for 70 times your default bet."

Set on a shield in front of a stone castle, the 6 reels offer a variety of precious stones in different colours and sizes. The game mechanics are powered by Titanways, allowing symbols to fall and giving players a chance to earn free spins and various reel modifiers that could lead to up to 20,000 times their wager.\n\nStep inside the walls of the Golden Castle in this medieval-themed slot game produced by Fantasma called Golden Castle Titanways. This captivating slot game uses the innovative Titanways engine, with precious stones appearing as symbols, some in a 3x3 size. The larger gems can be crushed during their descent, thanks to the Avalanche feature, while the bonus game comes with a progressive multiplier that could lead to big prizes. Additionally, players should watch out for the special Ghost King symbol that randomly transforms grid symbols.\n\nWith medieval and mysterious graphics, a golden figure with Hindu undertones sits above the game's grid, displaying symbols of all shapes and sizes. There's a sinister element to the castle where the action takes place, reminding one of a \"dark\" castle on a hill where unspeakable deeds occurred, overshadowing a town where no one dares to mention its name. It's one of those places where a casual glance reveals threatening shadows that quickly retreat from the windows. The extra threat is provided by a heavy soundtrack, although all that gold shining through the cracks in the stone is a motivating sign.\n\nPlayers can place a wager on their preferred device, from mobile to desktop, selecting an appropriate bet ranging from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin. Fantasma coupled their Titanways slot game debut with a highly volatile mathematical model and an RTP that comes in two respectable forms. The first is a default value of 96.34%, which increases to 97.12% when the buy feature is activated. The purchase of free spins could also be enticing, as the game offers a top prize of 20,000 times your bet.\n\nRegarding the Titanways system, which takes place on a grid arranged on a 6x6 basis, what makes it 'unique' is that symbols land in sizes of 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2, or 3x3. To confuse things, all symbols on individual reels (1x1, 1x2, 1x3) count as one symbol regardless of size. Others of sizes 2x2 or 3x3 are evaluated as one symbol on each reel they cover. Winning with Titanways is simple; you need three or more identical symbols to land adjacent from the first reel onwards. The symbols themselves consist of various precious stones which are valued from 1x for 6 of a kind to 10x if you get 6 diamonds.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe central part of the Titanways feature consists of regular paying symbols that can appear in five dimensions – 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2, and 3x3. While height has no impact on the value of the win, the two large square dimensions are valued as a symbol based on the reel they cover. For example, landing a combination of 1x2 and 2x2 symbols on all six reels counts as a 6x win. Only when two or more matching symbols land on the same reel does it lead to multiple winning combinations based on how many are on each reel.\n\nThe second part of the mechanic are the Avalanches, which is what the Americans call the Avalanche Mode. At the beginning of a sequence of spins, a random mix of symbols of various sizes falls from the top of the reels. Any winning combination will shatter and disappear before new symbols avalanche into the empty spaces. Any mega 2x2 or 3x3 symbol will crush the underlying symbols if there are partial gaps beneath them.\n\nLanding one or more grey Ghost King symbols will trigger the Wild Haunt feature. Each one will select a symbol larger than 1x1 and divide it into individual 1x1 symbols, potentially multiplying a win if it is part of a combo. Randomly, one or more of the split symbols can transform into golden Ghost King wild symbols. The triggered grey Ghost King will always transform into a wild once the modifier has been applied.\n\nCollecting three scatters in the arc at the top of the reels within a single sequence of spins will activate 10 Phantom Free Spins that can be reactivated indefinitely. During the feature, the progressive win multiplier starts at x1 and increases by x1 after each winning avalanche, with no limits. It does not reset between free spins. The Ghost King can also land in any free spin and split larger symbols, potentially having a significant impact on your winnings.\n\nFor impatient casino players fortunate enough to reside in a country without restrictions, there is a shortcut available to take you directly to the main event. Press the 'Buy Freespins' button at any time between spins in the base game, and you will be able to purchase a feature for 70 times your default bet.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a length of 15 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame mechanics and Titanways engine\n\nFantasma's Golden Castle Titanways operates on a 6x6 grid and uses the innovative Titanways engine. Symbols can appear in five dimensions - 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2, and 3x3. Winning is simple - players need three or more identical symbols to land adjacent from the first reel onwards. \n\nSymbol design and size\n\nThe game features various precious stones, some in 3x3 size, valued from 1x for 6 of a kind to 10x if you get 6 diamonds. Symbols are of different shapes and sizes, and some can be divided into smaller symbols through the Ghost King feature.\n\nAvalanche feature\n\nThe Avalanche feature shatters any winning combinations, which then disappear before new symbols avalanche into the empty spaces. Any mega 2x2 or 3x3 symbol will crush the underlying symbols if there are partial gaps beneath them.\n\nBonus game and progressive multiplier\n\nLanding three scatters activates 10 Phantom Free Spins with a progressive win multiplier that increases after each winning avalanche, with no limits. The multiplier does not reset between spins. During the feature, Ghost King can also split larger symbols, potentially leading to significant payouts.\n\nGhost King symbol\n\nThe Ghost King symbol randomly transforms grid symbols, potentially multiplying a win if it is part of a combo. Randomly, some of the split symbols can transform into golden Ghost King wild symbols.\n\nVolatile gameplay\n\nGolden Castle Titanways has highly volatile gameplay, offering players a chance to win up to 20,000 times their wager. \n\nRTP and buy feature\n\nThe game comes with an RTP of 96.34%, which increases to 97.12% if the buy feature is activated. The buy feature allows players to purchase a feature for 70 times their default bet.\n\nBetting range and top prize\n\nThe game allows players to place a wager ranging from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin and offers a top prize of 20,000 times your bet.\n\n        \n            ",

Set on a shield in front of a stone castle, the 6 reels offer a variety of precious stones in different colours and sizes. The game mechanics are powered by Titanways, allowing symbols to fall and giving players a chance to earn free spins and various reel modifiers that could lead to up to 20,000 times their wager.\n\nStep inside the walls of the Golden Castle in this medieval-themed slot game produced by Fantasma called Golden Castle Titanways. This captivating slot game uses the innovative Titanways engine, with precious stones appearing as symbols, some in a 3x3 size. The larger gems can be crushed during their descent, thanks to the Avalanche feature, while the bonus game comes with a progressive multiplier that could lead to big prizes. Additionally, players should watch out for the special Ghost King symbol that randomly transforms grid symbols.\n\nWith medieval and mysterious graphics, a golden figure with Hindu undertones sits above the game's grid, displaying symbols of all shapes and sizes. There's a sinister element to the castle where the action takes place, reminding one of a \"dark\" castle on a hill where unspeakable deeds occurred, overshadowing a town where no one dares to mention its name. It's one of those places where a casual glance reveals threatening shadows that quickly retreat from the windows. The extra threat is provided by a heavy soundtrack, although all that gold shining through the cracks in the stone is a motivating sign.\n\nPlayers can place a wager on their preferred device, from mobile to desktop, selecting an appropriate bet ranging from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin. Fantasma coupled their Titanways slot game debut with a highly volatile mathematical model and an RTP that comes in two respectable forms. The first is a default value of 96.34%, which increases to 97.12% when the buy feature is activated. The purchase of free spins could also be enticing, as the game offers a top prize of 20,000 times your bet.\n\nRegarding the Titanways system, which takes place on a grid arranged on a 6x6 basis, what makes it 'unique' is that symbols land in sizes of 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2, or 3x3. To confuse things, all symbols on individual reels (1x1, 1x2, 1x3) count as one symbol regardless of size. Others of sizes 2x2 or 3x3 are evaluated as one symbol on each reel they cover. Winning with Titanways is simple; you need three or more identical symbols to land adjacent from the first reel onwards. The symbols themselves consist of various precious stones which are valued from 1x for 6 of a kind to 10x if you get 6 diamonds.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe central part of the Titanways feature consists of regular paying symbols that can appear in five dimensions – 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2, and 3x3. While height has no impact on the value of the win, the two large square dimensions are valued as a symbol based on the reel they cover. For example, landing a combination of 1x2 and 2x2 symbols on all six reels counts as a 6x win. Only when two or more matching symbols land on the same reel does it lead to multiple winning combinations based on how many are on each reel.\n\nThe second part of the mechanic are the Avalanches, which is what the Americans call the Avalanche Mode. At the beginning of a sequence of spins, a random mix of symbols of various sizes falls from the top of the reels. Any winning combination will shatter and disappear before new symbols avalanche into the empty spaces. Any mega 2x2 or 3x3 symbol will crush the underlying symbols if there are partial gaps beneath them.\n\nLanding one or more grey Ghost King symbols will trigger the Wild Haunt feature. Each one will select a symbol larger than 1x1 and divide it into individual 1x1 symbols, potentially multiplying a win if it is part of a combo. Randomly, one or more of the split symbols can transform into golden Ghost King wild symbols. The triggered grey Ghost King will always transform into a wild once the modifier has been applied.\n\nCollecting three scatters in the arc at the top of the reels within a single sequence of spins will activate 10 Phantom Free Spins that can be reactivated indefinitely. During the feature, the progressive win multiplier starts at x1 and increases by x1 after each winning avalanche, with no limits. It does not reset between free spins. The Ghost King can also land in any free spin and split larger symbols, potentially having a significant impact on your winnings.\n\nFor impatient casino players fortunate enough to reside in a country without restrictions, there is a shortcut available to take you directly to the main event. Press the 'Buy Freespins' button at any time between spins in the base game, and you will be able to purchase a feature for 70 times your default bet.\n            ",

Set on a shield in front of a stone castle, the 6 reels offer a variety of precious stones in different colours and sizes. The game mechanics are powered by Titanways, allowing symbols to fall and giving players a chance to earn free spins and various reel modifiers that could lead to up to 20,000 times their wager.\n\nStep inside the walls of the Golden Castle in this medieval-themed slot game produced by Fantasma called Golden Castle Titanways. This captivating slot game uses the innovative Titanways engine, with precious stones appearing as symbols, some in a 3x3 size. The larger gems can be crushed during their descent, thanks to the Avalanche feature, while the bonus game comes with a progressive multiplier that could lead to big prizes. Additionally, players should watch out for the special Ghost King symbol that randomly transforms grid symbols.\n\nWith medieval and mysterious graphics, a golden figure with Hindu undertones sits above the game's grid, displaying symbols of all shapes and sizes. There's a sinister element to the castle where the action takes place, reminding one of a \"dark\" castle on a hill where unspeakable deeds occurred, overshadowing a town where no one dares to mention its name. It's one of those places where a casual glance reveals threatening shadows that quickly retreat from the windows. The extra threat is provided by a heavy soundtrack, although all that gold shining through the cracks in the stone is a motivating sign.\n\nPlayers can place a wager on their preferred device, from mobile to desktop, selecting an appropriate bet ranging from 20 cents to 50 euros per spin. Fantasma coupled their Titanways slot game debut with a highly volatile mathematical model and an RTP that comes in two respectable forms. The first is a default value of 96.34%, which increases to 97.12% when the buy feature is activated. The purchase of free spins could also be enticing, as the game offers a top prize of 20,000 times your bet.\n\nRegarding the Titanways system, which takes place on a grid arranged on a 6x6 basis, what makes it 'unique' is that symbols land in sizes of 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2, or 3x3. To confuse things, all symbols on individual reels (1x1, 1x2, 1x3) count as one symbol regardless of size. Others of sizes 2x2 or 3x3 are evaluated as one symbol on each reel they cover. Winning with Titanways is simple; you need three or more identical symbols to land adjacent from the first reel onwards. The symbols themselves consist of various precious stones which are valued from 1x for 6 of a kind to 10x if you get 6 diamonds.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe central part of the Titanways feature consists of regular paying symbols that can appear in five dimensions – 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2, and 3x3. While height has no impact on the value of the win, the two large square dimensions are valued as a symbol based on the reel they cover. For example, landing a combination of 1x2 and 2x2 symbols on all six reels counts as a 6x win. Only when two or more matching symbols land on the same reel does it lead to multiple winning combinations based on how many are on each reel.\n\nThe second part of the mechanic are the Avalanches, which is what the Americans call the Avalanche Mode. At the beginning of a sequence of spins, a random mix of symbols of various sizes falls from the top of the reels. Any winning combination will shatter and disappear before new symbols avalanche into the empty spaces. Any mega 2x2 or 3x3 symbol will crush the underlying symbols if there are partial gaps beneath them.\n\nLanding one or more grey Ghost King symbols will trigger the Wild Haunt feature. Each one will select a symbol larger than 1x1 and divide it into individual 1x1 symbols, potentially multiplying a win if it is part of a combo. Randomly, one or more of the split symbols can transform into golden Ghost King wild symbols. The triggered grey Ghost King will always transform into a wild once the modifier has been applied.\n\nCollecting three scatters in the arc at the top of the reels within a single sequence of spins will activate 10 Phantom Free Spins that can be reactivated indefinitely. During the feature, the progressive win multiplier starts at x1 and increases by x1 after each winning avalanche, with no limits. It does not reset between free spins. The Ghost King can also land in any free spin and split larger symbols, potentially having a significant impact on your winnings.\n\nFor impatient casino players fortunate enough to reside in a country without restrictions, there is a shortcut available to take you directly to the main event. Press the 'Buy Freespins' button at any time between spins in the base game, and you will be able to purchase a feature for 70 times your default bet.\n            ",
