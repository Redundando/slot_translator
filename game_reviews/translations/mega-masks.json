In other words, you can earn up to 250,000 coins, and this online slot has an impressive RTP of 96.21%. But how does Mega Masks come alive? Well, it features extra functionalities like Mega Symbols and free spins.

The wooden masks on the board remind us of the indigenous gods and colorful monsters. You might also find some precious stones that accumulate on the lower part of the display. The game grid is a rock, with a Mega bet button next to it. This button is where the real action happens, for it lets you choose between two bet levels. Firstly, a 20% additional cost on the first level and 50% more on the second level. You can select your stake value, starting from a minimum of 0.10 up to 100. Note that its RTP is 96.41%, which might entice you to take the plunge into this adventure. The first level has a considerable percentage of Mega symbols that grow exponentially in the second level. These symbols activate randomly, like the bonus free spin triggered by placing the scatter on the first, third, or fifth reels, earning you ten free spins.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nMega Masks might not have many bonuses or additional solutions to keep you in suspense, but the developers have executed a straightforward and well-designed slot game. It is intuitive, plays easily, and has a reasonable return to player ratio that is related to the online gambling industry averages.

Then Mega Masks is the slot game for you, developed by the renowned software house Relax Gaming. Immerse in the indigenous mask culture and win rich cash prizes while playing on a 5x5 base structure with 41 paylines and a whopping 2,451 times the bet win. In other words, you can earn up to 250,000 coins, and this online slot has an impressive RTP of 96.21%. But how does Mega Masks come alive? Well, it features extra functionalities like Mega Symbols and free spins. So, this 2020 can turn out to be a pleasant year with a bit of patience and a stroke of luck.\n\nGraphics and Symbols\nAs mentioned before, the theme revolves around the jungle and tribes that tell a well-thought-out story. The wooden masks on the board remind us of the indigenous gods and colorful monsters. You might also find some precious stones that accumulate on the lower part of the display. The game grid is a rock, with a Mega bet button next to it. This button is where the real action happens, for it lets you choose between two bet levels. Firstly, a 20% additional cost on the first level and 50% more on the second level. You can select your stake value, starting from a minimum of 0.10 up to 100. Note that its RTP is 96.41%, which might entice you to take the plunge into this adventure. The first level has a considerable percentage of Mega symbols that grow exponentially in the second level. These symbols activate randomly, like the bonus free spin triggered by placing the scatter on the first, third, or fifth reels, earning you ten free spins.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nMega Masks might not have many bonuses or additional solutions to keep you in suspense, but the developers have executed a straightforward and well-designed slot game. It is intuitive, plays easily, and has a reasonable return to player ratio that is related to the online gambling industry averages. The animations might be uncomplicated, but they enrich the gameplay structure, as intended. So, if you are looking for a distraction-free and secure way to have some fun, we recommend trying it out right away, utilizing the for-fun game version to master the rules before playing for real money.\n            ",
