This slot game offers many surprises, thanks to its special features which we will discover in this review. The special powers of the elements are so potent that they offer advantageous situations and potential great wins, as well as greatly increasing the excitement and fun during the game.\n\nThe features of the elementals in Alkemor's Tower\nAn \"elemental\" is a mythological being that belongs to one of the four elements of nature. Here we will see how they become protagonists of the game. To summon an elemental, you must display a book on the first two reels and an elemental symbol on the third. If books also appear on the fourth and fifth reels, the power of the elemental symbol increases.\n\nIf wizard Alkemor summons the power of Water, that is if the water symbol is displayed on the middle reel after two books, all books on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 become wild, while the one on reel 1 is transformed into a random paying symbol. The wins are recalculated and multiplied by the number of books and elemental symbols displayed.\n\nIf the power of Earth is summoned, all books on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 become wild while all other symbols are destroyed and leave room for other symbols and wins are recalculated.\n\nWith the power of Air, all books on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 become wild while all the other symbols fly in a tornado and reposition themselves on the display.\n\nThe power of Fire is quite strong: all books on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 become special wilds while the one on the first reel becomes a random paying symbol. At this point, extra wilds are added, i.e. extra wilds, which will be added to the winning combinations.\n\nFree spin bonus\nWith Betsoft, free spins are practically never lacking, and Alkemor's Tower slot is no exception. By displaying 2 blue books + 1 book squeezed by a plant, the Nature's Floor bonus is activated and you get 10, 12 or 15 free spins with special symbols and higher wins. In addition, the vine symbol may appear on the third reel and swallow nearby symbols, transforming them into prizes.\n\nInstead, by displaying 2 blue books + 1 book with the seal, the Celestial Floor bonus is activated, with 10, 12 or 15 free spins and two black holes that can appear on reels 2 and 4, devouring nearby symbols and transforming them into prizes.\n\nTechnical details\nAlkemor's Tower slot has 243 paylines, as all combinations are valid as long as they start from the first reel on the left. The RTP percentage is 94.96% and the volatility level is medium.\n\nFAQ: Answers to frequently asked questions\nHow do you play Alkemor's Tower slot game?\n\nThe aim of the Alkemor's Tower game is to obtain three or more identical symbols starting from the first reel on the left. With particular combinations, special features and free spins can be activated.\n\nWhere can you play Alkemor's Tower slot for real money?\n\nTo play Alkemor's Tower slot for real money, you can play in casinos that have it in their catalogue. On this page, you will find the best casinos where you can play this slot with real money.\n\nWhat are the features of Alkemor's Tower?\n\nAmong the features of Alkemor's Tower are the summoning of elementals, which have different characteristics depending on the creature summoned, and the free spin bonus rounds.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay\nElementals and their powers\nFree spin bonuses\nPaylines, RTP, and volatility\nGraphics and themes\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Alkemor's Tower\n\nBetsoft's Alkemor's Tower slot takes us into the world of magic where a wizard has the power to evoke fantastic and powerful creatures. This slot provides many surprises, thanks to its special functions that we will discover in this review. The special powers of the elements are so powerful that they offer advantageous situations and potentially excellent winnings, as well as greatly increasing the excitement and enjoyment during gameplay.\n\nThe elemental features of Alkemor's Tower\n\nAn \"elemental\" is a mythological being that belongs to one of the four elements of nature. Here we will see how they become the protagonists of the game. To evoke an elemental, a book must be displayed on the first two reels and an elemental symbol on the third. In case books also appear on the fourth and fifth reels, the power of the elemental symbol increases.\n\nIf the magician Alkemor evokes the power of Water, i.e. if the water symbol is displayed on the central reel after two books, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild, while the one on reel 1 is transformed into a randomly payable symbol. The winnings are recalculated and multiplied by the number of books and elemental symbols displayed.\n\nIn case the power of Earth is evoked, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild while all other symbols are destroyed and space is left for other symbols, and the winnings are recalculated.\n\nWith the power of Water, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild while all other symbols fly in a tornado and reposition on the display.\n\nThe power of Fire is quite powerful: all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become special wilds while the one on the first reel becomes a randomly payable symbol. At this point, extra wilds, i.e. extra wilds, are added, which will be added to the winning combinations.\n\nFree spin bonus\n\nWith the Betsoft provider, free spins are practically never missing, and the Alkemor's Tower slot is no exception. By displaying 2 blue books + 1 book squeezed by a plant, the Nature's Floor bonus is activated and 10, 12, or 15 free spins are obtained, with special symbols and higher winnings. Also, on the third, the symbol of the vine can appear, swallowing nearby symbols and turning them into prizes.\n\nInstead, by displaying 2 blue books + 1 book with the seal, the Celestial Floor bonus is activated, with 10, 12, or 15 free spins and two black holes that can appear on reels 2 and 4 devouring nearby symbols and turning them into prizes.\n\nTechnical details\n\nThe Alkemor's Tower slot has 243 paylines, as all combinations are valid as long as they start from the first reel on the left. The RTP percentage is 94.96%, and the level of volatility is medium.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nHow to play Alkemor's Tower slot?\n\nThe aim of the game of Alkemor's Tower is to obtain three or more identical symbols starting from the first reel on the left.

The game has many surprises with its special functions, including the evocation of elementals that offer advantageous situations and potentially excellent winnings. Special powers of elementals increase the excitement and enjoyment during gameplay. The aim of the game is to obtain three or more identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel.\n\nElementals and their unique powers\n\nElementals are mythological beings belonging to one of the four elements of nature, and they become the protagonists in this game. To evoke an elemental, a book must be displayed on the first two reels and an elemental symbol on the third. There are four powers in total: Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. Each one has a unique effect when evoked. For example, when Water is evoked, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild, and winnings are recalculated and multiplied. If Earth is evoked, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild, and all other symbols are destroyed and space is left for other symbols. The power of Fire will turn all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 into special wilds, and extra wilds will be added to the winning combinations. If Air is evoked, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild, and the other symbols fly in a tornado and reposition on the display.\n\nFree spin bonuses and how to trigger them\n\nAlkemor's Tower comes with two free spin bonuses activated by displaying the right symbol combinations. The Nature's Floor bonus is triggered by displaying 2 blue books and 1 book squeezed by a plant, and awards 10, 12, or 15 free spins with special symbols and higher winnings. On the third reel, the vine symbol can appear, swallowing nearby symbols and turning them into prizes. The Celestial Floor bonus is triggered by displaying 2 blue books and 1 book with a seal, and awards 10, 12, or 15 free spins and two black holes that can appear on reels 2 and 4 devouring nearby symbols and turning them into prizes.\n\nPaylines, RTP, and volatility\n\nAlkemor's Tower has 243 paylines, and all combinations that start from the leftmost reel are valid. The game's RTP percentage is 94.96% and has a medium level of volatility. \n\nOverall gaming experience and appeal\n\nAlkemor's Tower is an exciting and highly entertaining slot game with great graphics and animations. The game's unique theme, gameplay mechanics, and special functions make it stand out from other slots in the market. The evocation of elementals adds a unique twist to the game, and the free spin bonuses provide additional opportunities for players to win big. Moreover, with its medium level of volatility and RTP percentage of 94.96%, Alkemor's Tower is an excellent choice for both casual players and high rollers.\n\n        \n            ",

The aim of the game is to obtain three or more identical symbols starting from the first reel on the left. Special combinations, special functions, and free spins can be activated during gameplay, making it engaging and exciting.\n\nElementals and their powers\n\nThe elementals in Alkemor's Tower are mythological beings that belong to the four elements of nature. The slot's special functions are tied to the power of these elementals. By displaying certain combinations of symbol and book, players can evoke the power of the elementals. For instance, the power of Water makes all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild, while the one on reel 1 is transformed into a randomly payable symbol. The winnings are then recalculated and multiplied by the number of books and elemental symbols displayed. The power of Earth destroys all other symbols and creates space for other symbols, while the power of Fire adds extra wilds to winning combinations. These are just a few examples of how the elementals can impact gameplay.\n\nFree spin bonuses\n\nThe Alkemor's Tower slot game offers free spins with two bonus functions: Nature's Floor and Celestial Floor. By displaying 2 blue books + 1 book squeezed by a plant, the Nature's Floor bonus is activated, offering 10, 12, or 15 free spins with special symbols and higher winnings. During this bonus, the vine symbol can appear on the third reel, swallowing nearby symbols and turning them into prizes. On the other hand, by displaying 2 blue books + 1 book with the seal, the Celestial Floor bonus is activated, with 10, 12, or 15 free spins and two black holes that can appear on reels 2 and 4 devouring nearby symbols and turning them into prizes.\n\nPaylines, RTP, and volatility\n\nAlkemor's Tower has 243 paylines, making all combinations valid as long as they start from the first reel on the left. The RTP percentage is 94.96%, meaning that on average, players can expect to receive $94.96 back for every $100 wagered. The volatility of the game is medium, meaning that players can expect a balanced mix of high and low payouts.\n\nGraphics and themes\n\nBetsoft's Alkemor's Tower is set in a magical world, where a wizard can evoke powerful creatures. The graphics are stunning, providing a highly immersive experience as players explore the wizard's tower. The sound effects and animations are also excellent, adding to the game's excitement and enjoyment.\n\n        \n            ",

This slot provides many surprises, thanks to its special functions that we will discover in this review. The special powers of the elements are so powerful that they offer advantageous situations and potentially excellent winnings, as well as greatly increasing the excitement and enjoyment during gameplay.\n\nThe elemental features of Alkemor's Tower\n\nAn \"elemental\" is a mythological being that belongs to one of the four elements of nature. Here we will see how they become the protagonists of the game. To evoke an elemental, a book must be displayed on the first two reels and an elemental symbol on the third. In case books also appear on the fourth and fifth reels, the power of the elemental symbol increases.\n\nIf the magician Alkemor evokes the power of Water, i.e. if the water symbol is displayed on the central reel after two books, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild, while the one on reel 1 is transformed into a randomly payable symbol. The winnings are recalculated and multiplied by the number of books and elemental symbols displayed.\n\nIn case the power of Earth is evoked, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild while all other symbols are destroyed and space is left for other symbols, and the winnings are recalculated.\n\nWith the power of Water, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild while all other symbols fly in a tornado and reposition on the display.\n\nThe power of Fire is quite powerful: all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become special wilds while the one on the first reel becomes a randomly payable symbol. At this point, extra wilds, i.e. extra wilds, are added, which will be added to the winning combinations.\n\nFree spin bonus\n\nWith the Betsoft provider, free spins are practically never missing, and the Alkemor's Tower slot is no exception. By displaying 2 blue books + 1 book squeezed by a plant, the Nature's Floor bonus is activated and 10, 12, or 15 free spins are obtained, with special symbols and higher winnings. Also, on the third, the symbol of the vine can appear, swallowing nearby symbols and turning them into prizes.\n\nInstead, by displaying 2 blue books + 1 book with the seal, the Celestial Floor bonus is activated, with 10, 12, or 15 free spins and two black holes that can appear on reels 2 and 4 devouring nearby symbols and turning them into prizes.\n\nTechnical details\n\nThe Alkemor's Tower slot has 243 paylines, as all combinations are valid as long as they start from the first reel on the left. The RTP percentage is 94.96%, and the level of volatility is medium.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nHow to play Alkemor's Tower slot?\n\nThe aim of the game of Alkemor's Tower is to obtain three or more identical symbols starting from the first reel on the left. With special combinations, special functions and free spins can be activated.\n\nWhere can I play Alkemor's Tower slot for real money?\n\nTo play the Alkemor's Tower slot for real money, you can play at casinos that feature it in their catalog. On this page, you will find the best casinos where you can play this slot game for real money.\n\nWhat are the features of Alkemor's Tower?\n\nAmong the features of Alkemor's Tower are the evocations of the elementals, which have different characteristics depending on the creature evoked, and the free spin bonuses that provide extra prizes during the 10 or more free spins of the Nature Floor and Celestial Floor functions.\n            ",

This slot provides many surprises, thanks to its special functions that we will discover in this review. The special powers of the elements are so powerful that they offer advantageous situations and potentially excellent winnings, as well as greatly increasing the excitement and enjoyment during gameplay.\n\nThe elemental features of Alkemor's Tower\n\nAn \"elemental\" is a mythological being that belongs to one of the four elements of nature. Here we will see how they become the protagonists of the game. To evoke an elemental, a book must be displayed on the first two reels and an elemental symbol on the third. In case books also appear on the fourth and fifth reels, the power of the elemental symbol increases.\n\nIf the magician Alkemor evokes the power of Water, i.e. if the water symbol is displayed on the central reel after two books, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild, while the one on reel 1 is transformed into a randomly payable symbol. The winnings are recalculated and multiplied by the number of books and elemental symbols displayed.\n\nIn case the power of Earth is evoked, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild while all other symbols are destroyed and space is left for other symbols, and the winnings are recalculated.\n\nWith the power of Water, all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become wild while all other symbols fly in a tornado and reposition on the display.\n\nThe power of Fire is quite powerful: all books on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 become special wilds while the one on the first reel becomes a randomly payable symbol. At this point, extra wilds, i.e. extra wilds, are added, which will be added to the winning combinations.\n\nFree spin bonus\n\nWith the Betsoft provider, free spins are practically never missing, and the Alkemor's Tower slot is no exception. By displaying 2 blue books + 1 book squeezed by a plant, the Nature's Floor bonus is activated and 10, 12, or 15 free spins are obtained, with special symbols and higher winnings. Also, on the third, the symbol of the vine can appear, swallowing nearby symbols and turning them into prizes.\n\nInstead, by displaying 2 blue books + 1 book with the seal, the Celestial Floor bonus is activated, with 10, 12, or 15 free spins and two black holes that can appear on reels 2 and 4 devouring nearby symbols and turning them into prizes.\n\nTechnical details\n\nThe Alkemor's Tower slot has 243 paylines, as all combinations are valid as long as they start from the first reel on the left. The RTP percentage is 94.96%, and the level of volatility is medium.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nHow to play Alkemor's Tower slot?\n\nThe aim of the game of Alkemor's Tower is to obtain three or more identical symbols starting from the first reel on the left.
