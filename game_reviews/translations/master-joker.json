If I have piqued your interest, keep reading my review!\n\nBetting and main features\nThe Master Joker slot without registration has a very high RTP with 5 reels to play and a row with winning symbols. Starting at €0.01 you can already start placing your bets up to a maximum bet of €100.00. With only 1 payline, your winnings can reach up to 10,000 times your bet, which is equivalent to €1,000,000.00!\n\nThe symbols located at the bottom of the screen include traditional fruits and other distinctive special icons:\n\nCherries, \nPlums, \nWatermelons, \nGold Bars, \nLucky 7\n\nWhat are the special features of this slot without downloading?\nAs mentioned earlier, Master Joker has only 1 row and 5 reels that feature its winning symbols. This means that the slot has only one payline to bet on. The game has few features compared to other slots, but this does not mean that you cannot make fantastic winning combinations. The two functions not to be missed are:\n\nThe Multiplayer Wheel - This extra feature is hidden right behind the reels and represents one of the most exciting elements of the game designed by Pragmatic Play to make Master Joker more interesting and fun. With the Multiplayer option, you can also increase your winnings and reach up to 100x. To enjoy this feature, you have to land the Joker on the third reel, turning it into a Wild symbol. In addition, it is possible to reactivate this multiplier wheel every time Joker is included in a winning combination. There are 2x to 100x multipliers that you can obtain for each spin, increasing the value of winnings up to 10,000x!\n\nThe Wild Symbol - With the help of this symbol, you can form two winning combinations with 3 icons. The winning symbols can appear anywhere: from left to right, from right to left, or even in the center.\n\nWhere can you play the Master Joker slot?\nTake a look at our list of the best casinos to play the Master Joker slot and other Pragmatic Play titles. You can test the game for free in demo mode or, if you are a pro, immediately switch to real money betting, taking advantage of the unmissable Multiplayer option!\n        ",
