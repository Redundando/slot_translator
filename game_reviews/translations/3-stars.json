Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay\nSymbols\nBonus Features\nJackpots\nGraphics and Sound\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: \"3 Stars\" Review:\n\nLa JVL pays tribute to China with \"3 Stars\", an exciting new slot game with 50 paylines, a bonus game that eliminates low-paying symbols, and four jackpots! \n\nExperience the Orient in a slot game that celebrates China. There are countless slots that celebrate China, and it's no surprise that players are literally in love with them. What makes them so successful? Partly due to their high-quality graphics, and partly to their simple gameplay that often results in great wins. \"3 Stars\" is no exception. Its graphics are a feast of colors and richness, with a green background, red reels, and golden ornamental frames. The symbols are superbly designed and the Oriental music creates anticipation during the spins.\n\nFeatures of \"3 Stars\":\n\nThe grid has a familiar shape, with 5 reels and 3 rows, and a whopping 50 fixed paylines, each with a cost of €0.01. A spin will cost you €0.50. To win, you need to land identical symbol combinations on consecutive reels, starting from the first reel on the left and proceeding to the right.\n\nThe Turbo function lets you speed up the rotation of the reels, while the Autoplay feature lets you set a number of automatic spins between 10 and 500. The volatility is medium, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.01%.\n\nSymbols and features of \"3 Stars\":\n\nTo win, you need to form combinations of 3, 4, or 5 identical symbols, except for the child hugging the Koi carp, where just 2 symbols suffice. The lowest paying symbols are the playing cards from 10 to Ace, followed by the scroll, peaches, and bowl full of gold coins. The child hugging the carp is the highest paying symbol. \n\nIn addition to the sequence of symbols, you can also complete a winning combination using the Wild, which substitutes for all symbols except for the Scatter and the coins. \n\nFu, Lu, Shou, the three gods of Chinese mythology, are the Scatter symbol. Here's what happens when two or more land during the same spin:\n\n- 3 Scatter: 7 Free Spins + a win of 2x the bet\n- 4 Scatter: 7 Free Spins + a win of 5x the bet\n- 5 Scatter: 7 Free Spins + a win of 50x the bet\n\nMoreover, during the Bonus game, the low-paying icons (10, J, Q, K, A) are removed, leaving only the more lucrative symbols. With 3 additional Scatters, you're entitled to 5 extra free spins. At the end of the special feature, you'll see gold coins land on the reels, which can give you a multiplier from 2x to 20x, or one of four available jackpots.\n\nFAQ:\n\n- Where can I play \"3 Stars\"? \nThis slot is available in most legal online casinos.\n\n- How many free spins can I win based on the number of Scatters landing on the reels? \nWhether it's 3, 4, or 5 Scatters landing, you'll always be rewarded with 7 Free Spins. What changes is the bet multiplier: 2x, 5x, 50x.\n\n- What is the theoretical return to player (RTP) of \"3 Stars\"? \nIn this slot, the RTP value is 96.01%. \n\nExperience the thrill of the Orient and try \"3 Stars\" today!\n            ",

The game has Turbo and Autoplay options, medium volatility, and an RTP of 96.01%.\n\nSymbol design and sound effects\n\nImmerse yourself in the Orient with \"3 Stars\". The game's graphics are rich and color-filled with a green background, red reels, and golden ornamental frames. The symbols are excellently designed and flawlessly executed. The traditional Oriental music adds to the game's anticipation and atmosphere during the spins.\n\nWinning combinations and payouts\n\nTo land a win on \"3 Stars,\" by activating 50 paylines, you'll need to create a sequence of identical symbols on consecutive reels from the first reel on the left to the right. The child hugging a Koi Carp, which needs only two symbols, is the highest paying symbol while the playing cards from 10 to Ace are the lowest paying symbols. The game also features a Wild symbol that can substitute for all except the Scatter and the coin symbols.\n\nFree Spins and Bonus game\n\nFu, Lu, Shou, the three gods of Chinese mythology, are the Scatter symbols in \"3 Stars\". With their appearance on the reels, players can win 7 Free Spins plus the possibility to increase their winnings further by 2x, 5x, or 50x their bet depending on the number of Scatters that have landed. During the Free Spins Bonus game, the lower-paying symbols are removed altogether and replaced with the game's more valuable symbols, potentially increasing the chances of winning larger prizes. Landing three additional Scatters will result in 5 extra Free Spins! At the end of the Bonus game, add to your wins by receiving gold coins that reveal a multiplier up to 20x or one of four jackpots.\n\nJackpots\n\nIn the game of \"3 Stars,\" four jackpots are available to win, which are randomly triggered in the Bonus game and can be won by the appearance of gold coins on the reels. With each of the four jackpots being of a different value, this feature offers players a chance to take home the game's highest prizes with just one spin!\n\n        \n            ",

There are countless slots that celebrate China, and it's no surprise that players are literally in love with them. What makes them so successful? Partly due to their high-quality graphics, and partly to their simple gameplay that often results in great wins. \"3 Stars\" is no exception. Its graphics are a feast of colors and richness, with a green background, red reels, and golden ornamental frames. The symbols are superbly designed and the Oriental music creates anticipation during the spins.\n\nFeatures of \"3 Stars\":\n\nThe grid has a familiar shape, with 5 reels and 3 rows, and a whopping 50 fixed paylines, each with a cost of €0.01. A spin will cost you €0.50. To win, you need to land identical symbol combinations on consecutive reels, starting from the first reel on the left and proceeding to the right.\n\nThe Turbo function lets you speed up the rotation of the reels, while the Autoplay feature lets you set a number of automatic spins between 10 and 500. The volatility is medium, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.01%.\n\nSymbols and features of \"3 Stars\":\n\nTo win, you need to form combinations of 3, 4, or 5 identical symbols, except for the child hugging the Koi carp, where just 2 symbols suffice. The lowest paying symbols are the playing cards from 10 to Ace, followed by the scroll, peaches, and bowl full of gold coins. The child hugging the carp is the highest paying symbol. \n\nIn addition to the sequence of symbols, you can also complete a winning combination using the Wild, which substitutes for all symbols except for the Scatter and the coins. \n\nFu, Lu, Shou, the three gods of Chinese mythology, are the Scatter symbol. Here's what happens when two or more land during the same spin:\n\n- 3 Scatter: 7 Free Spins + a win of 2x the bet\n- 4 Scatter: 7 Free Spins + a win of 5x the bet\n- 5 Scatter: 7 Free Spins + a win of 50x the bet\n\nMoreover, during the Bonus game, the low-paying icons (10, J, Q, K, A) are removed, leaving only the more lucrative symbols. With 3 additional Scatters, you're entitled to 5 extra free spins. At the end of the special feature, you'll see gold coins land on the reels, which can give you a multiplier from 2x to 20x, or one of four available jackpots.\n\nFAQ:\n\n- Where can I play \"3 Stars\"? \nThis slot is available in most legal online casinos.\n\n- How many free spins can I win based on the number of Scatters landing on the reels? \nWhether it's 3, 4, or 5 Scatters landing, you'll always be rewarded with 7 Free Spins. What changes is the bet multiplier: 2x, 5x, 50x.\n\n- What is the theoretical return to player (RTP) of \"3 Stars\"? \nIn this slot, the RTP value is 96.01%. \n\nExperience the thrill of the Orient and try \"3 Stars\" today!\n            ",
