It's a common theme among various software developers and is loved by many experienced gamblers. The Egyptian theme continues to captivate players with its allure and mystery. Novomatic's Book of Ra, for example, is a popular saga series that features several versions and even a six-roller slot machine to cater to every player's taste. The game graphics are impressively beautiful, as seen in Ancient Egypt.\n\nFeatures\nAncient Egypt is a traditional five-reel slot machine with ten pay lines. It has a betting range of ten cents to €50, which makes it a soft game for players on any budget. However, with a maximum winning payout equivalent to 5000 times the bet placed, the game is still worth playing. The slot is medium to high volatility, and players can expect reasonably frequent, substantial wins. With an RTP of 96.13%, Ancient Egypt falls within Pragmatic Play's average return to player rate.\n\nSymbols\nCleopatra, the iconic Egyptian queen, is one of the most important symbols in the game, paying out €250 when she appears five times on the reels. Other thematic symbols include the Eye of Ra, the Anobi deity, and the Egyptian cross, with varying values. Other symbols will be traditional playing cards from 10 to Ace, and they hold the least value. The same icon, the Gold Scarab, is used for both the Wild and Scatter symbols. Landing three, four, or five Golden Scarabs on the reels in one go will pay a prize, regardless of their position on the screen. The prize could be one, ten, or even fifty times the initial bet. The Gold Scarab also unlocks the game's one bonus feature, where you choose a box to win a variety of different prizes. Players can earn up to 500 times their bet or earn free spins, with a randomly selected symbol selected for expanding wilds. This could potentially lead to the game's grand prize of 5000 times the initial bet if all symbols on the screen transform into Cleopatra. \n\nThe allure of Ancient Egypt never fades, and with Pragmatic Play's Ancient Egypt, players can immerse themselves in the mystery and excitement of that ancient culture.",

This theme is perhaps the most developed in the world of slot games, and practically all major software companies offer one or more in their catalog.\n\nThe Egyptian theme never seems to tire players, so much so that some developers offer entire series that are played in the shadow of the pyramids. This is the case with Novomatic and their highly successful Book of Ra series, which includes a six-reel slot instead of the standard five and various versions suitable for all tastes!\n\nFurthermore, slot machines set on the banks of the Nile offer manufacturers the opportunity to indulge in beautiful graphics, as \"Ancient Egypt\" shows us.\n\nKey Features:\n\n\"Ancient Egypt\" presents itself as a traditional five-reel slot machine with 10 paylines, with a betting range ranging from just ten cents to 50 €, making it quite \"soft\" in terms of bets. However, the maximum win of 5000 times the amount wagered makes it worthy of attention.\n\nThe volatility of this slot is medium-high, so it may not be very frequent to get wins, but they can be significant. With an RTP of 96.13%, \"Ancient Egypt\" is in line with the average of other Pragmatic Play slot machines in terms of the player's return.\n\nThe Symbols of \"Ancient Egypt\":\n\nQueen Cleopatra herself opens the game and is also one of the most important thematic symbols of this slot, paying a whopping €250 when she appears on the reels five times. Among the other Egyptian-themed symbols, we find the Eye of Ra, the deity Anobi, and the Egyptian cross, each with a different value.\n\nIn addition to these symbols, there are the traditional and non-thematic playing cards from ten to ace, which are the symbols with the lowest value.\n\nIn this slot machine, Wild and Scatter are represented by the same icon, the Golden Scarab: if it appears on the reels three, four, or five times during a single spin, regardless of its position, it pays a win equal to 1, 10, or even 50 times the bet.\n\nThe Golden Scarab also allows you to access the game's only special feature: three boxes will appear on the screen, and depending on the one chosen, you will win a different prize.\n\nThe lowest prize is a win equal to the bet, and the highest is up to 500 times. You can also earn free spins, during which a randomly chosen symbol will become an expandable Wild, which can give you the jackpot of 5000 times the bet if Queen Cleopatra covers the entire screen.\n\nAs an experienced gambler, \"Ancient Egypt\" offers a solid and enjoyable slot machine experience with the potential for significant payouts and an exciting Egyptian theme.\n            ",

This theme is perhaps the most developed in the world of slot games, and practically all major software companies offer one or more in their catalog.\n\nThe Egyptian theme never seems to tire players, so much so that some developers offer entire series that are played in the shadow of the pyramids. This is the case with Novomatic and their highly successful Book of Ra series, which includes a six-reel slot instead of the standard five and various versions suitable for all tastes!\n\nFurthermore, slot machines set on the banks of the Nile offer manufacturers the opportunity to indulge in beautiful graphics, as \"Ancient Egypt\" shows us.\n\nKey Features:\n\n\"Ancient Egypt\" presents itself as a traditional five-reel slot machine with 10 paylines, with a betting range ranging from just ten cents to 50 €, making it quite \"soft\" in terms of bets. However, the maximum win of 5000 times the amount wagered makes it worthy of attention.\n\nThe volatility of this slot is medium-high, so it may not be very frequent to get wins, but they can be significant. With an RTP of 96.13%, \"Ancient Egypt\" is in line with the average of other Pragmatic Play slot machines in terms of the player's return.\n\nThe Symbols of \"Ancient Egypt\":\n\nQueen Cleopatra herself opens the game and is also one of the most important thematic symbols of this slot, paying a whopping €250 when she appears on the reels five times. Among the other Egyptian-themed symbols, we find the Eye of Ra, the deity Anobi, and the Egyptian cross, each with a different value.\n\nIn addition to these symbols, there are the traditional and non-thematic playing cards from ten to ace, which are the symbols with the lowest value.\n\nIn this slot machine, Wild and Scatter are represented by the same icon, the Golden Scarab: if it appears on the reels three, four, or five times during a single spin, regardless of its position, it pays a win equal to 1, 10, or even 50 times the bet.\n\nThe Golden Scarab also allows you to access the game's only special feature: three boxes will appear on the screen, and depending on the one chosen, you will win a different prize.\n\nThe lowest prize is a win equal to the bet, and the highest is up to 500 times. You can also earn free spins, during which a randomly chosen symbol will become an expandable Wild, which can give you the jackpot of 5000 times the bet if Queen Cleopatra covers the entire screen.\n\nAs an experienced gambler, \"Ancient Egypt\" offers a solid and enjoyable slot machine experience with the potential for significant payouts and an exciting Egyptian theme.\n            ",
