    "original_text": "\nAshoka\nA nostra memoria, nessuno ha mai dedicato una slot ad Ashoka il Grande, personaggio leggendario sovrano dell’impero Maurya, conquistatore del subcontinente indiano, di parte della Persia e di altri territori, capace di convertire la sua popolazione al buddismo.\nA colmare questa lacuna ci ha pensato la Elk, con una slot dall’impatto visivo molto interessante e un gameplay che conquista sin dal primo Spin.\nLa griglia di grandi dimensioni si trova all’interno di una foresta, davanti a due statue, una di un teschio, l’altra di Kali, divinità con quattro braccia dea della morte.\nIl colore predominante è il grigio-verde opaco, ma non per i simboli che invece sono brillanti e contrastano bene con tutto il resto.\nLa musica indiana di sottofondo ha ritmi moderni e accattivanti, ma è possibile disattivarla all’apertura del gioco o più vanti accedendo al menù.\n \nCaratteristiche del gioco\nLa griglia molto grande, con 6 rulli e 8 righe, potrebbe accogliere 48 simboli ad ogni Spin, ma in realtà questo non succede quasi mai perché un numero variabile di posizioni resterà sempre vuoto. Il sistema di gioco è il cosiddetto Avalanche, quindi ogni volta che si ottiene una combinazione vincente, i simboli paganti vengono rimossi e le posizioni rimaste vuote vengono occupate da altri simboli. Questa funzione continua sino al primo Respin senza vincite. La puntata minima è di 0,20 € e per vincere è necessario ottenere almeno 8 simboli identici in qualsiasi punto della griglia, con una vincita massima stimata di ben 25.000 volte la scommessa.\nLa volatilità è alta, mentre il ritorno teorico al giocatore è del 94%.\n \nCome si vince con Ashoka\nIn Ashoka abbiamo diverse tipologie di simboli. Le carte da gioco dal J all’asso hanno un basso valore, a meno che non si riesca a creare gruppi di almeno 10 – 15 simboli. A seguire troviamo le gemme colorate (blu, verde, arancione e rosso), mentre la statua della tigre bianca è il simbolo più remunerativo.\nIn Ashoka ci sono tre diversi Wild: uno regolare, uno di grandi dimensioni 2×2 o 3×3 e uno caricato, ossia ne compaiono 2 o 3 nella stessa posizione. Questi rimangono bloccati finché non si ottengono almeno 3 vincite. Il Wild ricopre sempre la funzione di Jolly, quindi andrà a sostituire qualsiasi simbolo eccetto quelli speciali. Inoltre, una combo vincente di soli Wild paga quanto il simbolo di valore maggiore.\nLa X alla sinistra della griglia ci avvisa quando sta per arrivare un moltiplicatore, introdotto dalla pietra verde, o un Super moltiplicatore, indicato su una pietra rossa.\nIl teschio è invece il nostro Scatter e con 3 di essi si attivano 10 Free Drop, ossia giri gratuiti che possono essere riattivati con 3 ulteriori Scatter.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nAshoka funziona con ogni sistema operativo?\n\nSì, questa slot gira su qualsiasi device e con ogni sistema operativo, da IOS ad Android.\n\n\n\nQuanti giri gratuiti posso vincere con gli Scatter?\n\nIl numero di Free Spins è 10, ma con altri 3 Scatter durante la funzione Bonus si ottengono 5 ulteriori giri gratis.\n\n\n\nQual è il ritorno teorico al giocatore di Ashoka?\n\nAshoka ha un RTP pari al 94%.\n\n\n\n",

Finally, a slot game worthy of this great historical figure has been created by Elk. The visual impact is striking, with a large grid set in a forest, flanked by statues of the skull and Kali, the goddess of death. The predominant color is a matte grey-green, except for the symbols that are bright and contrast well with the background. The Indian music in the background is modern and captivating, and can be disabled in the settings.\n\nThe game features a massive grid with 6 reels and 8 rows that could potentially hold up to 48 symbols per spin, but in reality, a varying number of positions will remain empty. The game uses the Avalanche system, so every time you get a winning combination, the paying symbols are removed, and the empty positions are filled with new symbols. This function continues until the first respin without a win. The minimum bet is €0.20, and to win, you must get at least 8 identical symbols anywhere on the grid, with a maximum win estimated at 25,000 times the bet.

The wild always serves as a substitute for any symbol except the special ones. Moreover, a winning combination of only wilds pays the same as the highest value symbol. The X to the left of the grid warns you when a multiplier is coming, introduced by the green stone, or a super multiplier indicated on a red stone.

The game has been created by Elk, and boasts stunning visuals, with a grid set in a forest and flanked by statues of the skull and Kali, the goddess of death. The game features a massive grid with 6 reels and 8 rows that could potentially hold up to 48 symbols per spin. The game uses the Avalanche system, so every time you get a winning combination, the paying symbols are removed, and the empty positions are filled with new symbols. The volatility is high, and the theoretical return to the player is 94%. The symbols range from J to Ace cards, colored gems, up to the tiger statue, which is the most rewarding. There are three wilds, and a winning combination of only wilds pays the same as the highest value symbol. A multiplier is introduced by the green stone, or a super multiplier indicated on a red stone. Lastly, the skull is the scatter, and with 3 of them, you trigger 10 free drops that can be reactivated with 3 additional scatters.

Winning combinations are removed, and empty positions are filled with new symbols until the first respin without a win. The minimum bet is €0.20, and the objective is to get at least 8 identical symbols anywhere on the grid. The volatility is high, and the theoretical return to the player is 94%.

Finally, a slot game worthy of this great historical figure has been created by Elk. The visual impact is striking, with a large grid set in a forest, flanked by statues of the skull and Kali, the goddess of death. The predominant color is a matte grey-green, except for the symbols that are bright and contrast well with the background. The Indian music in the background is modern and captivating, and can be disabled in the settings.\n\nThe game features a massive grid with 6 reels and 8 rows that could potentially hold up to 48 symbols per spin, but in reality, a varying number of positions will remain empty. The game uses the Avalanche system, so every time you get a winning combination, the paying symbols are removed, and the empty positions are filled with new symbols. This function continues until the first respin without a win. The minimum bet is €0.20, and to win, you must get at least 8 identical symbols anywhere on the grid, with a maximum win estimated at 25,000 times the bet. The volatility is high, and the theoretical return to the player is 94%.\n\nThe symbols range from J to Ace cards, colored gems (blue, green, orange, and red), up to the tiger statue, which is the most rewarding. There are three wilds, one regular, one large (2x2 or 3x3), and a loaded one where 2 or 3 appear in the same position. These remain stuck until you get at least 3 wins. The wild always serves as a substitute for any symbol except the special ones. Moreover, a winning combination of only wilds pays the same as the highest value symbol. The X to the left of the grid warns you when a multiplier is coming, introduced by the green stone, or a super multiplier indicated on a red stone. Lastly, the skull is the scatter, and with 3 of them, you trigger 10 free drops that can be reactivated with 3 additional scatters.\n\nAshoka functions on any device and operating system from IOS to Android. The number of free drops is 10, but you can obtain 5 additional free spins with another 3 scatters during the bonus round. Ashoka has an RTP of 94%, so as an experienced gambler, you know what to expect from this exciting and rewarding slot game.\n            ",
