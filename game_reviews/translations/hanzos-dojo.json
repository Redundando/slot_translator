Head to the Land of the Rising Sun where you'll encounter the fiercest fighters in the ultimate training ground. It comes with 2 free spin features, colossal symbols, and expanding wild reels – there’s also a mini-slot that gives you wild reels or free spins with a colossal fighter symbol.\n\nA ninja-themed slot with a warrior's spirit\n\nEmbrace the warrior spirit and you could win a fortune. The Hanzo's Dojo slot game brings the martial arts theme to a new and exciting level, making it a full-on battle for slot supremacy. Featuring fearless warriors, a wise sensei, and plenty of clever features, this spinner is perfect for players who love fun and variety. However, before jumping into the fray and fighting, you need to master the ancient arts. To help you out, we've put together a simple review of the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine so you can learn the basics and become a true gambling ninja.\n\nThe blades fly through the air, slicing the silence and sending the scene into chaos. With the serenity broken, you appear from the dojo and prepare to fight. Years of training have brought you to this point, and now it's time to spin the reels of the Hanzo's Dojo. Rolling in a combination of ninjas, warriors, and geishas, this is your chance to become a hero of slot machine games and walk away with priceless wealth.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nWhen it comes to special features, Hanzo's Dojo free spins dominate. Although there are expanding wilds, this game is designed to put everyone in a headlock. Why? Well, ninjas are masters of headlock attacks like kicks and punches. So, in line with the theme, the developers at Yggdrasil HQ have created a unique selection of free spin bonuses.\n\nTo get started, three or more \"free spin\" symbols on the 20 paylines of this game will unlock a handful of free spins. In addition to rotation bonuses through the base game, the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine contains a second set of reels. Perched above the dojo, the three-symbol reel can unlock extra free spins.\n\nOf course, whenever you have two ways to activate some free spins, it's a good thing. However, the reason these Hanzo's Dojo free spins are interesting is that they come with \"boosters.\" Available in five flavors, these boosters will improve your bonus spins by adding wilds, multipliers, and multi-way paylines to the mix. In fact, it's through these innovative bonuses that you can win up to €100,000 or, if you bet the maximum, €500,000!\n\nOnce in, the central 3 reels will reveal 3×3 Colossal Symbols – if you get a Dragon Free Spin symbol, you'll receive 1 additional free spin and 1 additional feature. As for the added features, you can benefit from 2 extra free spins, win both ways, a 3×3 Colossal Symbol nudge, a 2x multiplier, or a 5th wild reel. This happens for each Dragon Free Spin symbol that shows up, so there are plenty of chances to add to the initial set of free spins.\n\nI really like the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine — it looks fantastic and has the potential to pay out big in the Mini Slot feature as it can result in 3 wild reels every time. It's all about the free spins feature where the 2x multiplier, extra free spins, win both ways, wild swing, and Colossal Symbol elbow can all combine to catastrophic effect.\n\nSimilar slot machines\n\nIf you like the theme, NetEnt's Warlords: Crystals of Power slot machine has a similar theme with excellent free spin features based on each of the warlords.\n\nIn this stunning graphics slot machine produced by NetEnt, you can also enjoy an incredibly high RTP.",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Hanzo’s Dojo\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nHanzo's Dojo\n\nThe Hanzo's Dojo slot machine from Yggdrasil Gaming has 5 reels and 25 paylines, with bets ranging from 0.25€ to 125€ per spin on all devices. Head to the Land of the Rising Sun where you'll encounter the fiercest fighters in the ultimate training ground. It comes with 2 free spin features, colossal symbols, and expanding wild reels – there’s also a mini-slot that gives you wild reels or free spins with a colossal fighter symbol.\n\nA ninja-themed slot with a warrior's spirit\n\nEmbrace the warrior spirit and you could win a fortune. The Hanzo's Dojo slot game brings the martial arts theme to a new and exciting level, making it a full-on battle for slot supremacy. Featuring fearless warriors, a wise sensei, and plenty of clever features, this spinner is perfect for players who love fun and variety. However, before jumping into the fray and fighting, you need to master the ancient arts. To help you out, we've put together a simple review of the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine so you can learn the basics and become a true gambling ninja.\n\nThe blades fly through the air, slicing the silence and sending the scene into chaos. With the serenity broken, you appear from the dojo and prepare to fight. Years of training have brought you to this point, and now it's time to spin the reels of the Hanzo's Dojo. Rolling in a combination of ninjas, warriors, and geishas, this is your chance to become a hero of slot machine games and walk away with priceless wealth.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nWhen it comes to special features, Hanzo's Dojo free spins dominate. Although there are expanding wilds, this game is designed to put everyone in a headlock. Why? Well, ninjas are masters of headlock attacks like kicks and punches. So, in line with the theme, the developers at Yggdrasil HQ have created a unique selection of free spin bonuses.\n\nTo get started, three or more \"free spin\" symbols on the 20 paylines of this game will unlock a handful of free spins. In addition to rotation bonuses through the base game, the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine contains a second set of reels. Perched above the dojo, the three-symbol reel can unlock extra free spins.\n\nOf course, whenever you have two ways to activate some free spins, it's a good thing. However, the reason these Hanzo's Dojo free spins are interesting is that they come with \"boosters.\" Available in five flavors, these boosters will improve your bonus spins by adding wilds, multipliers, and multi-way paylines to the mix. In fact, it's through these innovative bonuses that you can win up to €100,000 or, if you bet the maximum, €500,000!\n\nOnce in, the central 3 reels will reveal 3×3 Colossal Symbols – if you get a Dragon Free Spin symbol, you'll receive 1 additional free spin and 1 additional feature. As for the added features, you can benefit from 2 extra free spins, win both ways, a 3×3 Colossal Symbol nudge, a 2x multiplier, or a 5th wild reel. This happens for each Dragon Free Spin symbol that shows up, so there are plenty of chances to add to the initial set of free spins.\n\nI really like the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine — it looks fantastic and has the potential to pay out big in the Mini Slot feature as it can result in 3 wild reels every time. It's all about the free spins feature where the 2x multiplier, extra free spins, win both ways, wild swing, and Colossal Symbol elbow can all combine to catastrophic effect.\n\nSimilar slot machines\n\nIf you like the theme, NetEnt's Warlords: Crystals of Power slot machine has a similar theme with excellent free spin features based on each of the warlords.\n\nIn this stunning graphics slot machine produced by NetEnt, you can also enjoy an incredibly high RTP.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame Overview\nBetting Options\nFree Spin Features\nWild Reel Features\nMax Jackpot\nComparison to Similar Slots\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Hanzo's Dojo\n\nThe Hanzo's Dojo slot machine from Yggdrasil Gaming has 5 reels and 25 paylines, with bets ranging from 0.25€ to 125€ per spin on all devices. Head to the Land of the Rising Sun where you'll encounter the fiercest fighters in the ultimate training ground. It comes with 2 free spin features, colossal symbols, and expanding wild reels – there’s also a mini-slot that gives you wild reels or free spins with a colossal fighter symbol.\n\nA ninja-themed slot with a warrior's spirit\n\nEmbrace the warrior spirit and you could win a fortune. The Hanzo's Dojo slot game brings the martial arts theme to a new and exciting level, making it a full-on battle for slot supremacy. Featuring fearless warriors, a wise sensei, and plenty of clever features, this spinner is perfect for players who love fun and variety. However, before jumping into the fray and fighting, you need to master the ancient arts. To help you out, we've put together a simple review of the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine so you can learn the basics and become a true gambling ninja.\n\nThe blades fly through the air, slicing the silence and sending the scene into chaos. With the serenity broken, you appear from the dojo and prepare to fight. Years of training have brought you to this point, and now it's time to spin the reels of the Hanzo's Dojo. Rolling in a combination of ninjas, warriors, and geishas, this is your chance to become a hero of slot machine games and walk away with priceless wealth.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nWhen it comes to special features, Hanzo's Dojo free spins dominate. Although there are expanding wilds, this game is designed to put everyone in a headlock. Why? Well, ninjas are masters of headlock attacks like kicks and punches. So, in line with the theme, the developers at Yggdrasil HQ have created a unique selection of free spin bonuses.\n\nTo get started, three or more \"free spin\" symbols on the 20 paylines of this game will unlock a handful of free spins. In addition to rotation bonuses through the base game, the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine contains a second set of reels. Perched above the dojo, the three-symbol reel can unlock extra free spins.\n\nOf course, whenever you have two ways to activate some free spins, it's a good thing. However, the reason these Hanzo's Dojo free spins are interesting is that they come with \"boosters.\" Available in five flavors, these boosters will improve your bonus spins by adding wilds, multipliers, and multi-way paylines to the mix. In fact, it's through these innovative bonuses that you can win up to €100,000 or, if you bet the maximum, €500,000!\n\nOnce in, the central 3 reels will reveal 3×3 Colossal Symbols – if you get a Dragon Free Spin symbol, you'll receive 1 additional free spin and 1 additional feature. As for the added features, you can benefit from 2 extra free spins, win both ways, a 3×3 Colossal Symbol nudge, a 2x multiplier, or a 5th wild reel. This happens for each Dragon Free Spin symbol that shows up, so there are plenty of chances to add to the initial set of free spins.\n\nI really like the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine — it looks fantastic and has the potential to pay out big in the Mini Slot feature as it can result in 3 wild reels every time. It's all about the free spins feature where the 2x multiplier, extra free spins, win both ways, wild swing, and Colossal Symbol elbow can all combine to catastrophic effect.\n\nSimilar slot machines\n\nIf you like the theme, NetEnt's Warlords: Crystals of Power slot machine has a similar theme with excellent free spin features based on each of the warlords.\n\nIn this stunning graphics slot machine produced by NetEnt, you can also enjoy an incredibly high RTP.\n            ",

This game's free spins contain five boosters like wilds, multipliers, and multi-way paylines that improve your bonus spins. These innovative bonuses can help you win up to €100,000 or a maximum of €500,000 if you bet the maximum.\n\nExpanding Wild Reels\n\nThe game has expanding wild reels with a mini-slot that can give you free spins with a colossal fighter symbol or wild reels. If the central three reels reveal 3x3 Colossal Symbols, and you get the Dragon Free Spin symbol, you can receive one additional free spin and one additional feature. These added features include 2 extra free spins, win both ways, a 3x3 Colossal Symbol nudge, a 2x multiplier, or a 5th wild reel.\n\nColossal Symbols\n\nHanzo's Dojo boasts of Colossal Symbols where the central three reels reveal 3x3 symbols in the free spin feature. The 3x3 Colossal Symbols can be nudged to improve your chances of winning, and there's a Dragon Free Spin symbol that can unlock one additional free spin and one additional feature.\n\nMaximum Jackpot\n\nThe maximum payout in Hanzo's Dojo is a whopping €500,000, provided you bet the maximum of €125. Players can achieve the maximum payout through progressive free spins with five boosters or receive it in a Mini Slot feature, resulting in three wild reels every time.\n\nNinja-Themed Slot\n\nHanzo's Dojo from Yggdrasil Gaming is a ninja-themed slot with a martial arts theme that takes you on a journey to the Land of the Rising Sun. It is a full-on battle for slot supremacy featuring fearless warriors, a wise sensei, and clever features. The graphics and design of the game are visually stunning, making it all the more enjoyable to play.\n\nSimilar Slot Machine\n\nAnother similar slot machine to Hanzo's Dojo is NetEnt's Warlords: Crystals of Power. This game has a similar martial arts theme and revolves around the three warlords. Like Hanzo's Dojo, it also boasts of an excellent free spin feature. However, the difference between the two is that Warlords: Crystals of Power has a higher RTP than Hanzo's Dojo.\n\n        \n            ",

Head to the Land of the Rising Sun where you'll encounter the fiercest fighters in the ultimate training ground. It comes with 2 free spin features, colossal symbols, and expanding wild reels – there’s also a mini-slot that gives you wild reels or free spins with a colossal fighter symbol.\n\nA ninja-themed slot with a warrior's spirit\n\nEmbrace the warrior spirit and you could win a fortune. The Hanzo's Dojo slot game brings the martial arts theme to a new and exciting level, making it a full-on battle for slot supremacy. Featuring fearless warriors, a wise sensei, and plenty of clever features, this spinner is perfect for players who love fun and variety. However, before jumping into the fray and fighting, you need to master the ancient arts. To help you out, we've put together a simple review of the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine so you can learn the basics and become a true gambling ninja.\n\nThe blades fly through the air, slicing the silence and sending the scene into chaos. With the serenity broken, you appear from the dojo and prepare to fight. Years of training have brought you to this point, and now it's time to spin the reels of the Hanzo's Dojo. Rolling in a combination of ninjas, warriors, and geishas, this is your chance to become a hero of slot machine games and walk away with priceless wealth.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nWhen it comes to special features, Hanzo's Dojo free spins dominate. Although there are expanding wilds, this game is designed to put everyone in a headlock. Why? Well, ninjas are masters of headlock attacks like kicks and punches. So, in line with the theme, the developers at Yggdrasil HQ have created a unique selection of free spin bonuses.\n\nTo get started, three or more \"free spin\" symbols on the 20 paylines of this game will unlock a handful of free spins. In addition to rotation bonuses through the base game, the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine contains a second set of reels. Perched above the dojo, the three-symbol reel can unlock extra free spins.\n\nOf course, whenever you have two ways to activate some free spins, it's a good thing. However, the reason these Hanzo's Dojo free spins are interesting is that they come with \"boosters.\" Available in five flavors, these boosters will improve your bonus spins by adding wilds, multipliers, and multi-way paylines to the mix. In fact, it's through these innovative bonuses that you can win up to €100,000 or, if you bet the maximum, €500,000!\n\nOnce in, the central 3 reels will reveal 3×3 Colossal Symbols – if you get a Dragon Free Spin symbol, you'll receive 1 additional free spin and 1 additional feature. As for the added features, you can benefit from 2 extra free spins, win both ways, a 3×3 Colossal Symbol nudge, a 2x multiplier, or a 5th wild reel. This happens for each Dragon Free Spin symbol that shows up, so there are plenty of chances to add to the initial set of free spins.\n\nI really like the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine — it looks fantastic and has the potential to pay out big in the Mini Slot feature as it can result in 3 wild reels every time. It's all about the free spins feature where the 2x multiplier, extra free spins, win both ways, wild swing, and Colossal Symbol elbow can all combine to catastrophic effect.\n\nSimilar slot machines\n\nIf you like the theme, NetEnt's Warlords: Crystals of Power slot machine has a similar theme with excellent free spin features based on each of the warlords.\n\nIn this stunning graphics slot machine produced by NetEnt, you can also enjoy an incredibly high RTP.\n            ",

In fact, it's through these innovative bonuses that you can win up to €100,000 or, if you bet the maximum, €500,000!\n\nOnce in, the central 3 reels will reveal 3×3 Colossal Symbols – if you get a Dragon Free Spin symbol, you'll receive 1 additional free spin and 1 additional feature. As for the added features, you can benefit from 2 extra free spins, win both ways, a 3×3 Colossal Symbol nudge, a 2x multiplier, or a 5th wild reel. This happens for each Dragon Free Spin symbol that shows up, so there are plenty of chances to add to the initial set of free spins.\n\nI really like the Hanzo's Dojo slot machine — it looks fantastic and has the potential to pay out big in the Mini Slot feature as it can result in 3 wild reels every time. It's all about the free spins feature where the 2x multiplier, extra free spins, win both ways, wild swing, and Colossal Symbol elbow can all combine to catastrophic effect.\n\nSimilar slot machines\n\nIf you like the theme, NetEnt's Warlords: Crystals of Power slot machine has a similar theme with excellent free spin features based on each of the warlords.\n\nIn this stunning graphics slot machine produced by NetEnt, you can also enjoy an incredibly high RTP.\n        ",

The image should capture the excitement and energy of the game while still being playful and approachable."
