    "original_text": "\nDa Vinci Diamonds\nLeonardo Da Vinci ed i suoi capolavori sono i protagonisti della slot Da Vinci Diamonds\nDa Vinci Diamonds è la slot machine targata IGT e dedicata agli amanti dell’arte. All’interno di questo gioco infatti, le opere d’arte del maestro del rinascimento regaleranno vantaggiosissimi premi dando vita a molteplici combinazioni vincenti. Con la slot Da Vinci Diamonds sembrerà di stare in un vero e proprio museo nel quale i maggiori capolavori del maestro, come la Monna Lisa, la Dama con l’Ermellino e il Ritratto di Musico scorrono all’interno dei 5 rulli. La slot machine Da Vinci Diamonds è un viaggio nel passato all’insegna di ricchi premi.\nGrafica della slot machine\nLa slot machine Da Vinci Diamonds non potrebbe avere sfondo migliore se non quello della celebre Monna Lisa. All’interno della spelendida immagine, una cornice dorata racchiude i 5 rulli di questo fantastico gioco targato IGT. Oltre alle riproduzioni dei maggiori capolavori del magnifico artista, scorrono sui rulli molte pietre preziose per una grafica ricercata e davvero poco banale. L’interfaccia grafica appare chiara e ben organizzata. All’interno del pannello di gioco compaiono due comandi principali: all’estrema sinistra dello schermo il comando per scegliere il valore della scommessa, all’estrema destra quello utile ad avviare i rulli del gioco slot Da Vinci Diamonds. Nella parte bassa del pannello di gioco appare invece l’aggiornamento del saldo e delle vincite accumulate mentre nella parte alta è collocata l’icona per visualizzare le regole della slot machine e la tavola dei pagamenti. Gli effetti sonori del gioco ricordano delle note eseguite da un organo ed in maniera semplice e solenne annunciano le vincite effettuate. Pur ricordando periodi antichi, questa slot machine è davvero al passo con i tempi grazie alla funzionalità denominata “Tumbling Reels”. Infatti le icone del gioco cadono a cascata dall’alto, frantumandosi ad ogni combinazione vincente per lasciare spazio alla linea sovrastante di simboli. Questa mdalità permette di creare un maggior numero di combinazioni vincenti rispetto alla meccanica dei rulli delle classiche slot machine.\nLe funzioni e i bonus della slot\nLa slot machine Da Vinci Diamonds ha 5 rulli, 20 linee di puntata ed un valore di puntata che va da 1€ ad un massimo di 100€ per linea. La serie di simboli rigorosamente a tema che cadono dall’alto del pannello si mescolano alle icone di pietre preziose come ambra, smeraldo e rubino che, apparendo 5 volte sulla stessa linea pagano da 80 a 100 volte la giocata. Tra i capolavori artistici la più vantaggiosa è la Gioconda che restituisce la puntata moltiplicata per 100, seguita dal Ritratto di Musico che paga la puntata x500 e dalla Dama con l’Ermellino che premia con un discreto x300. L’icona del diamante con la scritta “Da Vinci Diamonds” è un vero colpo di fortuna, in quanto è in grado di pagare 5000 volte l’importo giocato. Il simbolo Wild della slot è l’icona riportante la voce “Wild” all’interno della cornice. Questo simbolo sostituisce tutti gli altri al fine di creare le migliori combinazioni vincenti. Il simbolo Scatter della slot è rappresentato dalla voce “Bonus” racchiuso in una cornice dorata. 3 simboli Scatter all’interno della stessa linea attivano il Free Spins Bonus che regala un minimo di 6 giri gratis con la possibilità, all’interno della stessa modalità di gioco, di arrivare ad un massimo di 300.\nSlot simili a Da Vinci Diamonds\nGli amanti dell’arte che hanno apprezzato la slot machine Da Vinci Diamonds non potranno tirarsi indietro davanti a titoli memorabili come la slot Van Gogh sviluppata da Relax Gaming che rappresenta una vera immersione nel mondo di questo fantastico pittore.\n",

This IGT slot is dedicated to art lovers, and within this game, the masterpieces of the Renaissance genius will reward you with lucrative prizes and multiple winning combinations. With Da Vinci Diamonds, you will feel like you're in a museum, where the greatest works of the master, such as the Mona Lisa, the Lady with an Ermine, and the Musicians, scroll on the 5 reels. The Da Vinci Diamonds slot machine is a journey into the past, full of opportunities to win big.\n\nSlot Machine Graphics\n\nThe Da Vinci Diamonds slot machine could not have a better backdrop than the famous Mona Lisa. The magnificent image frames the 5 reels of this fantastic IGT game, which features reproductions of the artist's greatest masterpieces and many precious stones, creating a refined graphic design. The interface appears clear and well-organized, with two main controls: on the far left of the screen, you can choose the value of your bet, and on the far right, you can start the Da Vinci Diamonds' reels. The bottom of the game panel displays your balance and your accumulated winnings, while the top part shows the icon to display the slot machine's rules and payout table. The game's sound effects recall notes played by an organ, announcing the winning combinations in a simple and solemn manner. This slot machine looks back to ancient times while keeping up with modern times, thanks to its Tumbling Reels functionality. The game's icons cascade down from the top, shattering with every winning combination to leave space for the line of symbols above, creating even more winning combinations than there are in classic slot machines.\n\nThe Slot's Features and Bonuses\n\nDa Vinci Diamonds has 5 reels, 20 paylines, and a betting value that ranges from €1 to a maximum of €100 per line.

Among the artistic masterpieces, the most advantageous is the Mona Lisa, which pays out the bet multiplied by 100, followed by the Musicians, who pay out the bet multiplied by 500, and the Lady with an Ermine, who rewards you with a decent bet of x300. The \"Da Vinci Diamonds\" diamond-shaped icon is a true stroke of luck, as it pays out 5000 times the amount you've bet. The slot's Wild symbol is the icon bearing the word \"Wild\" in the frame, which replaces all the other symbols to create the best winning combinations. The Scatter symbol is the word \"Bonus\" enclosed in a golden frame. Three Scatter symbols on the same line activate the Free Spins Bonus, which gives you a minimum of 6 free spins, with the chance, in the same game mode, to reach a maximum of 300.\n\nSimilar Slots to Da Vinci Diamonds\n\nArt lovers who have appreciated the Da Vinci Diamonds slot machine will not be disappointed by other memorable titles such as the Van Gogh slot developed by Relax Gaming, which is a real immersion into this fantastic painter's world.\n            ",
