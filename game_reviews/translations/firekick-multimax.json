Multimax is a slot game developed by Yggdrasil Gaming that creates a dynamic atmosphere of a stadium on the reels. The game has 3 rows and 5 reels, and the cascade function forms winning combinations when corresponding icons land on three reels from the leftmost one. There are 243 possible ways to win by betting from a minimum of 0.20€ up to a maximum of 75€ per spin.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nFirekick! Multimax offers many exciting special features to enhance the gaming experience. After every winning combination, a Wild appears on a specific reel, increasing its multiplier. The game also includes the Avalanche feature that removes the winning symbols from the grid every time a win is achieved, allowing new icons to fall and create new winning combinations. Additionally, Scatter combinations unlock the Gamble round and Free Spins function. The Free Spins feature is activated when three or more Scatters land simultaneously to win 6, 8, or 10 free spins. During the bonus round, individual multipliers are not reset between spins, which increases the chances of landing more lucrative payouts.\n\nMaximum Possible Win\n\nThe maximum possible win in Firekick! Multimax is up to 10,000 times the bet both on PC and mobile. It is a generous maximum win offered for those who make it through all the championship stages and eventually find themselves in the Super Bowl final.\n\nBetting Limits\n\nFirekick! Multimax allows players to make bets from a minimum of 0.20€ up to a maximum of 75€ per spin. It is essential to note that the size of the bet affects the size of the potential win.

Multimax\nFirekick! Multimax is the slot developed by the renowned studio Yggdrasil Gaming. Released in November, this game has become an instant hit among FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 fans, both for its engaging engine and its features. As an experienced gambler, you don't want to miss out on this one-of-a-kind slot game.\n\nUnique gameplay to experience the stadium atmosphere from home\nIf you're not planning a trip to the World Cup but are a sports enthusiast, Yggdrasil's Firekick! MultiMax slot machine will help you experience the stadium atmosphere from the comfort of your home. The layout of 3 rows and 5 reels is very dynamic thanks to the cascade function.\n\nWinning combinations can be formed when corresponding icons land on the following three reels, starting with the leftmost one. This gameplay creates 243 possible ways to win by betting from a minimum of 0.20€ up to a maximum of 75€ per spin. As an experienced gambler, you know that the bigger the bet, the bigger the potential win.\n\nMoreover, if you make it through all the championship stages, you'll get the chance to compete in the Super Bowl final as a generous maximum win.\n\nSpecial features offered by the Firekick! MultiMax slot\nThe stadium has many valuable symbols that pay out from triples. For example, the card signs pay out up to 0.80 times your bet, and the footballers up to 4 times. After each winning avalanche, a Wild will appear in an empty spot on a specific reel, which can increase the multiplier of reel 1. Scatter combinations will unlock the Gamble round and the Free Spins function.\n\nLet's dive into the details:\nAvalanche feature\nEvery time a win is achieved, the winning symbols will be removed from the grid, allowing new icons to fall. This can result in new winning combinations and consecutive wins, potentially creating a very dynamic gameplay.\n\nMultipliers and Wild symbols\nEach reel of the Firekick! MultiMax slot has an individual multiplier. Every time an avalanche is triggered, a wild symbol will be placed in one of the empty positions, increasing that reel's multiplier by x1.\n\nFree Spins feature\nTo activate this function, at least 3 scatters must land simultaneously to win 6, 8, or 10 free spins. Additionally, during the bonus round, individual multipliers will not be reset between spins, increasing the chances of landing more lucrative payouts.\n\nFAQs\nCan I play Firekick MultiMax slot for free?\n\nYes, our portal is the ideal place to try out Firekick! MultiMax without any registration or download required. Any safe gaming site that partners with Yggdrasil Gaming provides both the Demo mode and real money games.\n\nWhat is the maximum win potential in Firekick! MultiMax slot?\n\nThe maximum possible win in Firekick! MultiMax slot can reach up to 10,000 times the bet both on PC and mobile.\n\nAre there any other FIFA World Cup Qatar slots on Slotjava?\n\nCertainly. If you're a football and World Cup enthusiast, we suggest trying out Pragmatic Play's Spin and Score Megaways and SimplePlay's spectacular night version of the World Cup slot for free.\n            ",
