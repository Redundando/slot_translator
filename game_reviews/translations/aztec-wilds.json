Below, we have the options to increase or decrease the bet value, the button to set the automatic spins and the one to rotate the reels manually. In addition to the sound of falling rocks, the background music is dominated by tribal tunes featuring flutes and drums.\n\nMain Features\n\nThe game grid consists of five reels and four rows, with 1,024 possible ways to win, thanks to the different multipliers that can be activated during the Free Spins.

This South American culture shrouded in mystery due to their human sacrifices to the gods, has long been the stuff of legends. But there is another reason why the Aztecs have captured the imagination of so many - their wealth and hidden treasures that the greatest explorers have sought in vain for centuries.\n\nUnlike many other slots dedicated to this topic, Iron Dog Studio's Aztec Wilds has a highly polished graphics standard, as we have come to expect from this software house in its previous works. Moreover, its gameplay system is far from the standard, with unique features that distinguish it from the majority of slots.\n\nThe game grid is framed in stone, and the brightly colored symbols are etched onto square rocks. On either side are two circular-shaped sculptures representing magical symbols that are essential to the gameplay. Below, we have the options to increase or decrease the bet value, the button to set the automatic spins and the one to rotate the reels manually. In addition to the sound of falling rocks, the background music is dominated by tribal tunes featuring flutes and drums.\n\nMain Features\n\nThe game grid consists of five reels and four rows, with 1,024 possible ways to win, thanks to the different multipliers that can be activated during the Free Spins. The RTP is 96.2%, and the game has high volatility. The betting range is from €0.50 to €50 and players can activate from a minimum of five automatic spins up to a maximum of 999.\n\nSymbols and Features of Aztec Wilds\n\nThe lower-paying symbols are those referring to playing cards - from 10 to Ace. After these, there are the three masks - green, red, and blue. However, the real highlight of this game are the three different Wilds:\n\nThe first is a regular Wild with the function of a Joker, which can appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and can substitute for all symbols.\n\nThe second Wild is called a \"sticky\" Wild and can only appear on reel 3. If the symbols underneath it disappear, it drops by one row, otherwise it covers the normal Wild function.\n\nThere is then an expanding Wild that can appear randomly on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. By occupying the entire reel, the chances of winning combinations increase significantly.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this game has a cascading symbol system: every winning combination makes the affected symbols disappear, replaced by new symbols that could also be winning. Every time this happens, the sculpture beside the frame is crossed by lava, highlighting a part of it. With four consecutive combinations, Free Spins are activated. During the Free Spins, after four wins, a progressive multiplier is activated, which can reach a maximum of 6X. \n\nOverall, Aztec Wilds provides an immersive gaming experience for experienced gamblers with a love for ancient civilizations and a taste for something unique.\n            ",

This South American culture shrouded in mystery due to their human sacrifices to the gods, has long been the stuff of legends. But there is another reason why the Aztecs have captured the imagination of so many - their wealth and hidden treasures that the greatest explorers have sought in vain for centuries.\n\nUnlike many other slots dedicated to this topic, Iron Dog Studio's Aztec Wilds has a highly polished graphics standard, as we have come to expect from this software house in its previous works. Moreover, its gameplay system is far from the standard, with unique features that distinguish it from the majority of slots.\n\nThe game grid is framed in stone, and the brightly colored symbols are etched onto square rocks. On either side are two circular-shaped sculptures representing magical symbols that are essential to the gameplay. Below, we have the options to increase or decrease the bet value, the button to set the automatic spins and the one to rotate the reels manually. In addition to the sound of falling rocks, the background music is dominated by tribal tunes featuring flutes and drums.\n\nMain Features\n\nThe game grid consists of five reels and four rows, with 1,024 possible ways to win, thanks to the different multipliers that can be activated during the Free Spins. The RTP is 96.2%, and the game has high volatility. The betting range is from €0.50 to €50 and players can activate from a minimum of five automatic spins up to a maximum of 999.\n\nSymbols and Features of Aztec Wilds\n\nThe lower-paying symbols are those referring to playing cards - from 10 to Ace. After these, there are the three masks - green, red, and blue. However, the real highlight of this game are the three different Wilds:\n\nThe first is a regular Wild with the function of a Joker, which can appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and can substitute for all symbols.\n\nThe second Wild is called a \"sticky\" Wild and can only appear on reel 3. If the symbols underneath it disappear, it drops by one row, otherwise it covers the normal Wild function.\n\nThere is then an expanding Wild that can appear randomly on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. By occupying the entire reel, the chances of winning combinations increase significantly.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this game has a cascading symbol system: every winning combination makes the affected symbols disappear, replaced by new symbols that could also be winning. Every time this happens, the sculpture beside the frame is crossed by lava, highlighting a part of it. With four consecutive combinations, Free Spins are activated. During the Free Spins, after four wins, a progressive multiplier is activated, which can reach a maximum of 6X. \n\nOverall, Aztec Wilds provides an immersive gaming experience for experienced gamblers with a love for ancient civilizations and a taste for something unique.\n            ",
