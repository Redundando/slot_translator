I comandi per settare il gioco si trovano in basso sulla schermata principale, circondati da ragnatele, e ci piace il fatto che anche i link siano inseriti sotto forma di simboli tematici: per stabilire l’importo massimo della puntata occorrerà cliccare su un calderone, per dare il via ai giri su uno scrigno dorato e per avere tutte le informazioni sulla slot bisognerà consultare un librone antico.\nPrima di iniziare il gioco è necessario impostare il valore della scommessa, da un minimo di 0,01 € fino a un massimo di 20 €, stabilire su quante linee di gioco scommettere e decidere infine se si vuole giocare in modalità manuale o impostando i giri e proseguendo con l’Autoplay.\nNel complesso si tratta di una slot machine molto ben fatta, con una grafica accattivante e delle belle animazioni; il valore abbastanza basso delle puntate rende Halloween Fortune un gioco adatto anche ai principianti o a coloro che non vogliono investire grosse somme; infine, un RTP del 97,6% è di tutto rispetto e associato a una volatilità medio-alta garantisce vincite piuttosto frequenti.\nI simboli della notte più paurosa dell’anno!\nUna caratteristica apprezzabile di Halloween Fortune è il fatto che tutti i simboli, sia quelli regolari che quelli speciali, siano tematici e, diciamo la verità, noi non abbiamo sentito la mancanza delle solite carte da gioco!\nTra i simboli troviamo innanzitutto le protagoniste del gioco, ossia tre belle streghe a cavallo di una scopa, distinguibili tra di loro dal colore dello sfondo, rosa, blu e verde. A fare compagnia alle affascinanti fattucchiere ci sono ovviamente un gatto nero e un lugubre corvo, nella migliore tradizione di Halloween, e ovviamente non potevano mancare gli “strumenti del mestiere”: una pozione di un inquietante colore rosa fosforescente, un medaglione antico, una candela su un teschio! I simboli hanno tutti valore diverso, per conoscere il quale occorre consultare la tabella dei pagamenti.\nSimboli Wild e Scatter\nLa zucca di Halloween rappresenta il simbolo Wild di questa slot e non solo funge da Jolly, potendosi sostituire a tutti gli altri simboli per ottenere un allineamento vincente, ma se compare su tutti i cinque rulli in una linea di pagamento attiva, determina la vincita di ben 10.000 gettoni, la più alta possibile in questo gioco.\nIl logo di Halloween Fortune è lo Scatter, che funziona come un moltiplicatore a seconda delle volte in cui compare sui rulli, a prescindere dalla posizione: 3 simboli moltiplicano la puntata x5, 4 moltiplicano x10 e 5 x50.\nÈ presente anche un simbolo Bonus che permetterà di accedere a dei giri gratuiti in cui tutte le vincite sono moltiplicate.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nQuesto gioco può innescare grandi vincite?\n\nSì. Halloween Fortune può attivare un pagamento massimo di un moltiplicatore 10.000x.

We love the fact that the links are presented as themed symbols: to set the bet amount, click on a cauldron; to start the spins, choose a golden chest; and for information on the game, consult an ancient book. \n\nTo start playing, you simply need to set the bet amount (from as little as €0.01 to a maximum of €20), select how many paylines to bet on, and decide whether to play in manual mode or set up Autoplay. With a high RTP of 97.6% and medium-high volatility, Halloween Fortune is perfect for those looking for frequent, sizeable wins. \n\nA Theme with Serious Charm \n\nOne of the standout features of Halloween Fortune is that all symbols, whether regular or special, are thematically on-point and spooky - no poker playing cards here! The game's protagonists are three beautiful witches on broomsticks, each with a unique background color - pink, blue, and green. Alongside these enchanting ladies are familiar Halloween imagery, like a black cat and a creepy crow, as well as witchy accoutrements like a potion bottle, an ancient amulet, and a skull-topped candle. Each symbol has a different value, which is listed in the game's paytable. \n\nWilds, Scatters, and Bonuses Abound \n\nHalloween Fortune's pumpkin symbol serves as the game's Wild. It not only acts as a joker, substituting for other symbols to create winning combinations, but when it appears on all five reels in an active payline, it pays out a whopping 10,000 coins, the highest possible payout in the game. \n\nThe game's logo is the Scatter – which acts as a multiplier depending on how many times it appears on the reels, regardless of its position. Three scatters multiply the bet by 5, four scatters multiply by 10, and five scatters multiply by 50. \n\nFinally, there is the Bonus symbol. When it appears on reels one and five, it triggers a Free Spins round. During this round, all wins are multiplied for even more excitement, making it an excellent opportunity for players to score big. \n\nFAQs \n\nCan Halloween Fortune yield significant wins? \n\nWithout a doubt. Halloween Fortune can trigger a maximum payout of 10,000x the stake. Alternatively, if you enjoy horror-themed slots, try out Habanero's Hot Hot Halloween, available in our demo-mode catalog. \n\nDoes the Playtech mobile platform support Halloween Fortune? \n\nAbsolutely. This game and Playtech slots, in general, are fully mobile-supported, allowing you to play anytime, anywhere. \n\nWhat are multiline slots? \n\nMultiline slots are online games that offer players the opportunity to win prizes during play. A portion of the games comes with a fixed number of bets, while the amount of the other part can be adapted by the players.\n        ",

Then look no further than Halloween Fortune, a five-reel, 20-payline slot from the renowned Playtech software house. With an intuitive, easy-to-master gameplay mechanism, this game has a lot to offer experienced players and newcomers alike. \n\nThe game is set against a gothic/horror backdrop, complete with a full moon rising against the night sky. Commands and options are located at the bottom of the main screen, surrounded by spiderwebs. We love the fact that the links are presented as themed symbols: to set the bet amount, click on a cauldron; to start the spins, choose a golden chest; and for information on the game, consult an ancient book. \n\nTo start playing, you simply need to set the bet amount (from as little as €0.01 to a maximum of €20), select how many paylines to bet on, and decide whether to play in manual mode or set up Autoplay. With a high RTP of 97.6% and medium-high volatility, Halloween Fortune is perfect for those looking for frequent, sizeable wins. \n\nA Theme with Serious Charm \n\nOne of the standout features of Halloween Fortune is that all symbols, whether regular or special, are thematically on-point and spooky - no poker playing cards here! The game's protagonists are three beautiful witches on broomsticks, each with a unique background color - pink, blue, and green. Alongside these enchanting ladies are familiar Halloween imagery, like a black cat and a creepy crow, as well as witchy accoutrements like a potion bottle, an ancient amulet, and a skull-topped candle. Each symbol has a different value, which is listed in the game's paytable. \n\nWilds, Scatters, and Bonuses Abound \n\nHalloween Fortune's pumpkin symbol serves as the game's Wild. It not only acts as a joker, substituting for other symbols to create winning combinations, but when it appears on all five reels in an active payline, it pays out a whopping 10,000 coins, the highest possible payout in the game. \n\nThe game's logo is the Scatter – which acts as a multiplier depending on how many times it appears on the reels, regardless of its position. Three scatters multiply the bet by 5, four scatters multiply by 10, and five scatters multiply by 50. \n\nFinally, there is the Bonus symbol. When it appears on reels one and five, it triggers a Free Spins round. During this round, all wins are multiplied for even more excitement, making it an excellent opportunity for players to score big. \n\nFAQs \n\nCan Halloween Fortune yield significant wins? \n\nWithout a doubt. Halloween Fortune can trigger a maximum payout of 10,000x the stake. Alternatively, if you enjoy horror-themed slots, try out Habanero's Hot Hot Halloween, available in our demo-mode catalog. \n\nDoes the Playtech mobile platform support Halloween Fortune? \n\nAbsolutely. This game and Playtech slots, in general, are fully mobile-supported, allowing you to play anytime, anywhere. \n\nWhat are multiline slots? \n\nMultiline slots are online games that offer players the opportunity to win prizes during play. A portion of the games comes with a fixed number of bets, while the amount of the other part can be adapted by the players.\n            ",

Then look no further than Halloween Fortune, a five-reel, 20-payline slot from the renowned Playtech software house. With an intuitive, easy-to-master gameplay mechanism, this game has a lot to offer experienced players and newcomers alike. \n\nThe game is set against a gothic/horror backdrop, complete with a full moon rising against the night sky. Commands and options are located at the bottom of the main screen, surrounded by spiderwebs. We love the fact that the links are presented as themed symbols: to set the bet amount, click on a cauldron; to start the spins, choose a golden chest; and for information on the game, consult an ancient book. \n\nTo start playing, you simply need to set the bet amount (from as little as €0.01 to a maximum of €20), select how many paylines to bet on, and decide whether to play in manual mode or set up Autoplay. With a high RTP of 97.6% and medium-high volatility, Halloween Fortune is perfect for those looking for frequent, sizeable wins. \n\nA Theme with Serious Charm \n\nOne of the standout features of Halloween Fortune is that all symbols, whether regular or special, are thematically on-point and spooky - no poker playing cards here! The game's protagonists are three beautiful witches on broomsticks, each with a unique background color - pink, blue, and green. Alongside these enchanting ladies are familiar Halloween imagery, like a black cat and a creepy crow, as well as witchy accoutrements like a potion bottle, an ancient amulet, and a skull-topped candle. Each symbol has a different value, which is listed in the game's paytable. \n\nWilds, Scatters, and Bonuses Abound \n\nHalloween Fortune's pumpkin symbol serves as the game's Wild. It not only acts as a joker, substituting for other symbols to create winning combinations, but when it appears on all five reels in an active payline, it pays out a whopping 10,000 coins, the highest possible payout in the game. \n\nThe game's logo is the Scatter – which acts as a multiplier depending on how many times it appears on the reels, regardless of its position. Three scatters multiply the bet by 5, four scatters multiply by 10, and five scatters multiply by 50. \n\nFinally, there is the Bonus symbol. When it appears on reels one and five, it triggers a Free Spins round. During this round, all wins are multiplied for even more excitement, making it an excellent opportunity for players to score big. \n\nFAQs \n\nCan Halloween Fortune yield significant wins? \n\nWithout a doubt. Halloween Fortune can trigger a maximum payout of 10,000x the stake. Alternatively, if you enjoy horror-themed slots, try out Habanero's Hot Hot Halloween, available in our demo-mode catalog. \n\nDoes the Playtech mobile platform support Halloween Fortune? \n\nAbsolutely. This game and Playtech slots, in general, are fully mobile-supported, allowing you to play anytime, anywhere. \n\nWhat are multiline slots? \n\nMultiline slots are online games that offer players the opportunity to win prizes during play. A portion of the games comes with a fixed number of bets, while the amount of the other part can be adapted by the players.\n            ",

Then look no further than Halloween Fortune, a five-reel, 20-payline slot from the renowned Playtech software house. With an intuitive, easy-to-master gameplay mechanism, this game has a lot to offer experienced players and newcomers alike. \n\nThe game is set against a gothic/horror backdrop, complete with a full moon rising against the night sky. Commands and options are located at the bottom of the main screen, surrounded by spiderwebs. We love the fact that the links are presented as themed symbols: to set the bet amount, click on a cauldron; to start the spins, choose a golden chest; and for information on the game, consult an ancient book. \n\nTo start playing, you simply need to set the bet amount (from as little as €0.01 to a maximum of €20), select how many paylines to bet on, and decide whether to play in manual mode or set up Autoplay. With a high RTP of 97.6% and medium-high volatility, Halloween Fortune is perfect for those looking for frequent, sizeable wins. \n\nA Theme with Serious Charm \n\nOne of the standout features of Halloween Fortune is that all symbols, whether regular or special, are thematically on-point and spooky - no poker playing cards here! The game's protagonists are three beautiful witches on broomsticks, each with a unique background color - pink, blue, and green. Alongside these enchanting ladies are familiar Halloween imagery, like a black cat and a creepy crow, as well as witchy accoutrements like a potion bottle, an ancient amulet, and a skull-topped candle. Each symbol has a different value, which is listed in the game's paytable. \n\nWilds, Scatters, and Bonuses Abound \n\nHalloween Fortune's pumpkin symbol serves as the game's Wild. It not only acts as a joker, substituting for other symbols to create winning combinations, but when it appears on all five reels in an active payline, it pays out a whopping 10,000 coins, the highest possible payout in the game. \n\nThe game's logo is the Scatter – which acts as a multiplier depending on how many times it appears on the reels, regardless of its position. Three scatters multiply the bet by 5, four scatters multiply by 10, and five scatters multiply by 50. \n\nFinally, there is the Bonus symbol. When it appears on reels one and five, it triggers a Free Spins round. During this round, all wins are multiplied for even more excitement, making it an excellent opportunity for players to score big. \n\nFAQs \n\nCan Halloween Fortune yield significant wins? \n\nWithout a doubt. Halloween Fortune can trigger a maximum payout of 10,000x the stake. Alternatively, if you enjoy horror-themed slots, try out Habanero's Hot Hot Halloween, available in our demo-mode catalog. \n\nDoes the Playtech mobile platform support Halloween Fortune? \n\nAbsolutely. This game and Playtech slots, in general, are fully mobile-supported, allowing you to play anytime, anywhere. \n\nWhat are multiline slots? \n\nMultiline slots are online games that offer players the opportunity to win prizes during play. A portion of the games comes with a fixed number of bets, while the amount of the other part can be adapted by the players.\n            ",
