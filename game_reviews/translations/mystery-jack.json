Wow, that's a lot of things! And that's not all that Mystery Jack has to offer.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nThe double-up game in Mystery Jack is a classic feature. You can launch this round by clicking on the Gamble button after each successful spin. The image of a playing card is on the screen during this round. Your task is to guess the color of the card. Guessing right doubles your winnings, and guessing wrong cancels your winnings for the last spin.\n\nThe double-up game stands out with the ability to play half of your winnings. Use the ½ Take button to transfer half your winnings to your account and play another half in the gambling feature. The Take button allows you to collect winnings at any time. In this case, the gambling game will be over.\n\nThree train wagon symbols with the word \"Mystery\" launch the mini-bonus round. You win credits as a reward. Your winnings can range from 1 to 500 times your total bet. The image of a moving train appears on the game screen during the mini-round. You can see the numbers changing rapidly in front of this train. The slot randomly selects the amount of your winnings – the number that stops on the screen determines the number of credits you win.\n\nThis slot features three types of special symbols: \n\nThe Wild symbol is the portrait of a cowboy. This symbol can replace regular symbols and help create winning combinations. A combination of three cowboys increases your total bet by 160 times.\n\nBonus – It's the image of a train carriage that says \"Mystery.\" Three of these symbols launch the mini-bonus round. As a result, you win credits.\n\nScatter – It's a train carriage with the phrase \"Free Games\". Three of these symbols anywhere on the reels launch free spins.\n\nMystery Jack can form several combinations for a spin. In this case, your winnings will be added up. You can transfer your credits to your balance or try to increase this amount in the double-up game.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf there's one thing about Mystery Jack that attracts everyone, it's its wild, Wild West graphics and the possibility of making lots of easy money. Why not try your luck with Wild Jack 81 as well? It's a slot machine produced by Wazdan, which features a cowboy as its protagonist, and allows you to win up to 2,240 times your bet in a single game.\n        ",

You can play it for free on neonslots.com. It features three types of special symbols. With a bit of luck, you can earn a payout for the Mystery symbol and win bonus spins for the Free Games symbols. You can also multiply all your winnings in the gambling feature. The full version of the slot allows you to win the progressive jackpot.\n\nMysterious Graphics\n\nMystery Jack is a classic online slot with three reels, old-school cartoon symbols and twenty-seven paylines that offer you greater winning possibilities. Fans of traditional slots will definitely find pleasure in the design of this game thanks to its retro symbols. Spin the reels and find cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, and many other fruits, as well as bells, sevens, BAR or the icon of the angry bull, and collect your winnings! The unique atmosphere of the Wild West, completed by the graphics of the slot, is what makes the whole experience particularly appealing. And with the Big Screen Mode feature, you can fully enjoy the western theme!\n\nWhether it's the scorching heat of the desert or the special game features, Mystery Jack will leave you speechless! Look for the Jack symbol on the reels – the main character is there for you, playing the wild, to help you complete winning combinations. There's also a Mystery Bonus waiting for you. Three Mystery symbols scattered on the reels can trigger big prizes. And there's more! Land three Free Games symbols and activate 9 Free Spins to increase your chances of winning even more! Wow, that's a lot of things! And that's not all that Mystery Jack has to offer.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nThe double-up game in Mystery Jack is a classic feature. You can launch this round by clicking on the Gamble button after each successful spin. The image of a playing card is on the screen during this round. Your task is to guess the color of the card. Guessing right doubles your winnings, and guessing wrong cancels your winnings for the last spin.\n\nThe double-up game stands out with the ability to play half of your winnings. Use the ½ Take button to transfer half your winnings to your account and play another half in the gambling feature. The Take button allows you to collect winnings at any time. In this case, the gambling game will be over.\n\nThree train wagon symbols with the word \"Mystery\" launch the mini-bonus round. You win credits as a reward. Your winnings can range from 1 to 500 times your total bet. The image of a moving train appears on the game screen during the mini-round. You can see the numbers changing rapidly in front of this train. The slot randomly selects the amount of your winnings – the number that stops on the screen determines the number of credits you win.\n\nThis slot features three types of special symbols: \n\nThe Wild symbol is the portrait of a cowboy. This symbol can replace regular symbols and help create winning combinations. A combination of three cowboys increases your total bet by 160 times.\n\nBonus – It's the image of a train carriage that says \"Mystery.\" Three of these symbols launch the mini-bonus round. As a result, you win credits.\n\nScatter – It's a train carriage with the phrase \"Free Games\". Three of these symbols anywhere on the reels launch free spins.\n\nMystery Jack can form several combinations for a spin. In this case, your winnings will be added up. You can transfer your credits to your balance or try to increase this amount in the double-up game.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf there's one thing about Mystery Jack that attracts everyone, it's its wild, Wild West graphics and the possibility of making lots of easy money. Why not try your luck with Wild Jack 81 as well? It's a slot machine produced by Wazdan, which features a cowboy as its protagonist, and allows you to win up to 2,240 times your bet in a single game.\n            ",

You can earn payouts for several combinations of symbols, and you can transfer your credits to your balance or try to increase your winnings in the double-up game.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nMystery Jack features three special symbols: the Wild symbol, the Bonus symbol, and the Scatter symbol. The Wild symbol can replace regular symbols and help you create winning combinations. The Bonus symbol rewards you with extra credits in the mini-bonus round, while the Scatter symbol triggers the Free Spins feature.\n\nBonus Rounds\n\nMystery Jack offers a mini-bonus round and a Free Spins feature. The mini-bonus round is triggered when you land three Bonus symbols on the reels. You can win credits ranging from 1 to 500 times your total bet. The Free Spins feature is triggered when you land three Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. You can get up to 9 free spins.\n\nGambling Feature\n\nMystery Jack allows you to gamble your winnings in a double-up game. You can launch this round by clicking on the Gamble button after each successful spin. Your task is to guess the color of the card. Guessing right doubles your winnings, and guessing wrong cancels your winnings for the last spin. You can play half of your winnings in this round or collect your winnings at any time.\n\nGraphics\n\nMystery Jack features old-school cartoon symbols and a Wild West theme that creates a unique atmosphere. The slot looks great, with high-quality graphics and smooth animations. The Big Screen Mode feature also allows you to enjoy the western theme fully.\n\nTheme\n\nMystery Jack has a Wild West theme that is captured by the graphics and the symbols on the reels. The game takes place in an old western town and features symbols like cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, bells, sevens, BAR, and the angry bull icon. The cowboy Wild symbol and the moving train in the mini-bonus round add to the theme of the game.\n\n        \n            ",
