The console for changing bets and making spins is basic and easy to use. But don't let the simplicity fool you - Cave King is packed with prehistoric fun! It's like stepping into a Flintstones episode, except instead of being a cartoon, it's a chance to win real money. The game's symbols include cave drawings, prehistoric creatures, and, of course, the Cave King himself. The game's soundtrack generally sounds like a bunch of grunting, but that just adds to the game's atmosphere. </p><p>Overall, if you're looking for a no-frills, fun-filled slot machine that'll take you all the way back to the Stone Age - minus the lack of proper sanitation - then Cave King is a solid choice. Just remember: when you hit a big win, don't do the Tarzan yell too loudly or you might scare your neighbors!</p>\"\n}"

The console for changing bets and making spins is nothing special, but it's easy to use. The game offers the chance to win with the Wild symbol, which replaces any symbol to form a winning combination. The Bonus symbol functions as a Scatter, and by getting three in a row, you get four free spins, while five Scatters can earn you 15 free spins. If you manage to place five Bonus symbols in a row on the first payline, you can win the incredible Jackpot of €30,000. During the Free Spins feature, you can also get multipliers that can earn you up to 10x your initial bet.\n\nGraphics\n\nCave King presents cartoon-style symbols on a purple background. The symbols include the Cave King, who is a primitive man wearing a crown, and his wife, who wears a purple fur and a diadem. The design is reminiscent of the Flintstones cartoon series and is sure to appeal to players who enjoyed the show as children.\n\nBonus Features\n\nCave King offers interesting bonuses that make the game enjoyable. The Wild symbol replaces any symbol within a payline to form a winning combination. The Bonus symbol functions as a Scatter, and by getting three in a row, you get four free spins, while five Scatters can earn you 15 free spins. If you manage to place five Bonus symbols in a row on the first payline, you can win the incredible Jackpot of €30,000. During the Free Spins feature, you can also get multipliers that can earn you up to 10x your initial bet.\n\nPayout Percentage\n\nCave King has a payout percentage of 95%, which is slightly higher than High 5 Games' standards but still lower than the general average of 95.5%. It is also significantly lower than the standards of big names in online gambling, such as NetEnt.\n\nJackpot\n\nCave King offers a Jackpot of €30,000 if you manage to place five Bonus symbols in a row on the first payline. While this is a great payout, it may be difficult to achieve. However, the Free Spins feature offers multipliers that can earn you up to 10x your initial bet, making it a fun way to potentially win big.\n\n        \n            ",

The console for changing bets and making spins is basic and easy to use.\n\nGraphics and Theme\n\nThe symbols of the Cave King and his wife, both wearing crowns and furs respectively, are cartoon-style, which is sure to appeal to those who followed the adventures of the Flintstones as children. The slot's purple background provides a great backdrop while the symbols and characters that appear inside are enjoyable to look at.\n\nSpecial Symbols and Features\n\nThe Cave King symbol serves as the Wild that replaces any other symbol inside a payline to form a winning combination. The Bonus symbol, which functions as the Scatter, enables you to get free spins and potentially earn a huge payout of up to €30,000. Additionally, the Free Spins feature allows for multipliers of up to 10x your initial bet.\n\nJackpot and Payouts\n\nThe payout of Cave King is lower than the average at 95%, which is somewhat disappointing but can still provide plenty of excitement when playing the game. The presence of a Jackpot of €30,000 for placing five Bonus symbols in a row on the first payline, along with the potential to get multipliers of up to 10x during the Free Spins feature, can make up for this.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nIf you enjoyed the prehistoric setting of Cave King, you may want to check out The Flintstones Slot produced by Playtech. The Flintstones Slot has an incredible 1,024 paylines and is dedicated to the famous cartoon series, making it another excellent choice for those who enjoy prehistoric themes.\n\n        \n            ",

Were the primitive men, those famous cave dwellers, members of a social structure or did they live completely independently, thinking only of their own survival? These are the questions that many have asked, and many historians have tried to answer them thoroughly.\n\nBut one producer of online gambling software, High 5 Games, has taken it a step further and created a slot machine on the topic that manages to unite enthusiasts of prehistory, dinosaurs, and prehistoric animals all at once. Read on to find out more!\n\nA Prehistoric Graphic\n\nCave King, the slot machine produced by High 5 Games, presents a classic 5x3 grid. Despite being a commonly used design, it's the symbols that make the slot particularly enjoyable. The reels and characters that appear inside are cartoon-style, and are sure to appeal to those who followed the adventures of the Flintstones as children.\n\nOn a purple background, the reels spin and give you the chance to discover the symbols of the Cave King, who is a primitive man wearing a crown, and his wife, who wears a purple fur and a diadem.\n\nThe console for changing bets and making spins is nothing special. You can upgrade from low to high winnings simply by using the arrows and then click on the Spin button.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nAs we previously mentioned, Cave King, the slot machine produced by High 5 Games, displays a classic 5x3 grid. The number of paylines is also very standard, as the slot has 30 paylines.\n\nDespite being slightly higher than High 5 Games' standards, the payout of 95% is still lower than the general average of 95.5%, and significantly lower than the standards of big names in online gambling, such as NetEnt.\n\nHowever, playing Cave King is still extremely enjoyable with the presence of very interesting bonuses. The Cave King symbol is a Wild, an icon that replaces any symbol within a payline to form a winning combination.\n\nThen there is the Bonus symbol. It's a very interesting feature as it allows for truly high earnings. It functions as a Scatter, and by getting three in a row, you get four free spins, while five Scatters can earn you 15 free spins. A feature to keep in mind is that if you manage to place five Bonus symbols in a row on the first payline, you can win the incredible Jackpot of €30,000.\n\nDuring the Free Spins feature, you can easily get multipliers that can earn you up to 10x your initial bet!\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf you enjoyed the prehistoric setting of Cave King, we recommend that you give The Flintstones Slot a try. As you might have guessed, it's the slot machine dedicated to the famous cartoon series, produced by Playtech, and with an incredible 1,024 paylines!\n        ",
