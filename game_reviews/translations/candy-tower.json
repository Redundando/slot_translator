The theme of this game takes you on a journey through a candy-filled world of cakes, ice creams, and sweets that will leave your mouth watering just by looking at them. The excellent work done on the graphics leave nothing to chance, with the background changing between the base game and bonus games, featuring natural landscapes covered with mouth-watering fruits and chocolates. \n\nThe playing grid is large and occupies a good portion of the screen, with the game's mascot cheering on our wins on the left-hand side. Below are the candy icons that serve as counters, keeping track of the number of symbols collected to activate the bonus games. \n\nOne thing to note is that the game system is clustered, meaning you win when you collect at least seven identical symbols vertically or horizontally. The game grid is 6x5 and the value of the token is variable, with a minimum of €0.01. You must use a minimum of 15 tokens to spin the reels. \n\nThe variability is high with an RTP value of 96.73%. The base symbols are four different shaped candies: a purple star, yellow triangle, green hexagon, blue square, and red heart. With each spin, you can collect between 7 and 30 symbols, updating the counter below the mascot each time. \n\nThe Wild symbol appears on reels 2, 4, and 6 during the base game, and on the first and sixth during free spins, functioning as both a joker and falling from above to help create winning combinations. \n\nThe Scatter symbol - in addition to being a paying symbol - awards a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 250 free spins. Furthermore, this function can be reactivated. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, depending on the number of clusters you collect, a tower of candy is built, up to a maximum of 5 layers. This activates the Bonus Boost function, featuring expanding Wilds, movable Wilds, and multipliers of up to x888, potentially doubling your wins. \n\nOverall, Candy Tower is an exciting slot game featuring vibrant graphics, delicious candies, and highly lucrative bonus features, making it an excellent choice for experienced gamblers who are looking for an immersive and rewarding slot experience.",

The game has a minimum token value of €0.01 and requires a minimum of 15 tokens to spin the reels. The game mascot cheers on wins, and candy icons act as counters for the number of symbols collected to trigger bonus games.\n\nBonus Features\n\nCandy Tower offers lucrative bonus features. A tower of candy is built depending on the number of clusters collected in the base game, up to a maximum of five layers. This activates the Bonus Boost function, where expanding Wilds, movable Wilds, and multipliers of up to x888, potentially doubling wins, are available. The Scatter symbol awards a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 250 free spins, and this feature can be reactivated. The Wild symbol appears on reels 2, 4, 6 during the base game and on the first and sixth reel during free spins, acting as a joker and falling from above to create winning combinations.\n\nGraphics\n\nCandy Tower boasts a candy-filled world of cakes, ice creams, and sweets that are visually appealing. The graphics showcase natural landscapes covered with mouth-watering fruits and chocolates, and the playing grid takes up a significant portion of the screen. The game mascot cheers on wins, and the candy icons act as counters, keeping track of the number of symbols collected for the bonus games.\n\nFree Spins\n\nCandy Tower features Scatter symbols that trigger a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 250 free spins, which can be reactivated. During free spins, Wild symbols appear on the first and sixth reel, acting as a joker and helping to create winning combinations.\n\nReturn To Player (RTP)\n\nCandy Tower has high variability, with an RTP value of 96.73%. The base symbols are four shaped candies: a purple star, yellow triangle, green hexagon, blue square, and red heart. Each spin can collect between 7 and 30 symbols, and the candy icons act as counters, updating the number of symbols collected for the bonus games.\n\n        \n            ",

The theme of this game takes you on a journey through a candy-filled world of cakes, ice creams, and sweets that will leave your mouth watering just by looking at them. The excellent work done on the graphics leave nothing to chance, with the background changing between the base game and bonus games, featuring natural landscapes covered with mouth-watering fruits and chocolates. \n\nThe playing grid is large and occupies a good portion of the screen, with the game's mascot cheering on our wins on the left-hand side. Below are the candy icons that serve as counters, keeping track of the number of symbols collected to activate the bonus games. \n\nOne thing to note is that the game system is clustered, meaning you win when you collect at least seven identical symbols vertically or horizontally. The game grid is 6x5 and the value of the token is variable, with a minimum of €0.01. You must use a minimum of 15 tokens to spin the reels. \n\nThe variability is high with an RTP value of 96.73%. The base symbols are four different shaped candies: a purple star, yellow triangle, green hexagon, blue square, and red heart. With each spin, you can collect between 7 and 30 symbols, updating the counter below the mascot each time. \n\nThe Wild symbol appears on reels 2, 4, and 6 during the base game, and on the first and sixth during free spins, functioning as both a joker and falling from above to help create winning combinations. \n\nThe Scatter symbol - in addition to being a paying symbol - awards a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 250 free spins. Furthermore, this function can be reactivated. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, depending on the number of clusters you collect, a tower of candy is built, up to a maximum of 5 layers. This activates the Bonus Boost function, featuring expanding Wilds, movable Wilds, and multipliers of up to x888, potentially doubling your wins. \n\nOverall, Candy Tower is an exciting slot game featuring vibrant graphics, delicious candies, and highly lucrative bonus features, making it an excellent choice for experienced gamblers who are looking for an immersive and rewarding slot experience.\n        ",
