Playtech ha realizzato una macchinetta sulla famosa famiglia del ‘Papà Americano’ partendo da 5 rulli e 40 linee di pagamento facilmente giocabili non solo da desktop ma anche da dispositivi mobile. Insieme a Stan, Roger, Francine, Hayley, Wheels e Legman il giocatore avrà la possibilità di scoprire le diverse funzioni bonus che passano anche per le 5 opzioni di giri gratuiti che si basano proprio sui nostri protagonisti. In palio ci sono tantissime vincite: dai 25 giri gratuiti ai simboli di Stan impilati, senza dimenticare Wild in espansione e moltiplicatori progressivi con un massimo di 10x.\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nLa grafica è ovviamente ispirata alla serie di cartoon che abbiamo visto tutti almeno una volta nella vita. Sullo sfondo quindi ritroviamo la tipica ambientazione di Langley Falls e le animazioni che si alternano durante il gameplay sono quelle che imitano la serie. Tra i simboli con valore basso abbiamo A, K e Q proposti nei tre colori che richiamano la bandiera americana, ovvero rosso, bianco e blu. Ma il pezzo forte è rappresentato dai simboli con valore maggiore che sono rappresentati dai protagonisti del cartone: troviamo così il figlio Steve e sua sorella Hayley, l’animale domestico Klaus, mamma Francine e papà Stan. Proprio il capo famiglia è quello che offre una ricompensa maggiore fino a 250 monete se appare 5 volte su un payline. Il Jolly è l’alieno Roger che prende il posto di tutti i simboli sui rulli ma non del bonus Schmooblydong che è il simbolo più prezioso capace di offrire 750 monete se formi una combinazione di 5 simboli. Considera che la ruota Schmooblydong è fondamentale per questa slot: se appare sui rulli 1 e 3 ti regala un nuovo giro e se lo posizioni anche nel rullo 5 puoi sbloccare la funzione Free spin. Si determina così con quale personaggio giocherai oltre al numero di giri che ottieni: si va da un minimo di 3 e si sale a 5, 8, 10 e un massimo di 25 spin.\nTra le funzioni più valide della slot American Dad citiamo la Random Wilds di Roger dove si posizionano casualmente dei Jolly per ogni giro gratuito, aumentando così la possibilità di vincita. Se sei alla ricerca di un moltiplicatore devi cercare la funzione progressiva di Hayley, che determina il valore massimo di vincita da 2x, 3x, 5x fino a 10x. E non dimentichiamo poi il ruolo di Wheels e Legman, che lasciano una scia di simboli jolly sui rulli per ogni spin gratuito.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot American Dad\nLe funzionalità del gioco sono davvero tante e costruite in modo preciso per realizzare un preciso obiettivo. Playtech ha fatto un ottimo lavoro sia per grafica che animazioni, senza però tralasciare i game extra che incontri giro dopo giro.\nL’esperienza di gioco è sicuramente divertente e lo sarà non solo se sei un fan della serie, perché i suoi bonus sanno essere davvero gratificanti.\n",

Together with Stan, Roger, Francine, Hayley, Wheels, and Legman, the player will have the opportunity to discover a range of bonus features that include 5 options for free spins featuring our beloved protagonists. The stakes are high with a chance to win big, ranging from 25 free spins to stacked Stan symbols, not forgetting the expanding Wilds and progressive multipliers with a maximum of 10x.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nThe graphics are obviously inspired by the cartoon series that we have all seen at least once in our life. So, in the background, we find the typical setting of Langley Falls, and the animations that alternate during gameplay are those that imitate the series. Among the low-value symbols, we have A, K and Q offered in the three colors that recall the American flag, namely red, white, and blue. But the real highlight is represented by the high-value symbols, which are represented by the protagonists of the cartoon: we find Steve and his sister Hayley, the family pet Klaus, mom Francine, and dad Stan. Precisely, the head of the family offers the highest reward of up to 250 coins if he appears five times on a payline. The Wild symbol is the alien Roger, who replaces all symbols on the reels except for the Schmooblydong bonus, which, if you form a combination of 5 symbols, is the most valuable symbol that can offer 750 coins. Bear in mind that the Schmooblydong wheel is essential for this slot: if it appears on reels 1 and 3, it gives you a new spin, and if you position it on reel 5, you can unlock the Free spin function. This determines which character you will play with, as well as the number of spins you get, ranging from a minimum of 3 to 5, 8, 10, and a maximum of 25 spins.\n\nAmong the most valid functions of the American Dad slot, we mention Roger's Random Wilds, where Wild symbols are randomly placed on each free spin, thereby increasing your chances of winning. If you are looking for a multiplier, you need to look for Hayley's progressive function, which determines the maximum win value ranging from 2x, 3x, 5x to 10x. And let's not forget the role of Wheels and Legman, who leave a trail of Wild symbols on the reels for each free spin.\n\nFinal Considerations on the American Dad Slot\nThe game's functionalities are many and precisely designed to achieve a specific goal. Playtech has done an excellent job with both graphics and animations, without neglecting the game extras that you encounter from spin to spin.\n\nThe gaming experience is undoubtedly fun and will be gratifying not only if you are a fan of the series, but because the bonuses are genuinely rewarding.",

Playtech has brought to life a slot machine about the famous family of the 'American Dad', starting from 5 reels and 40 paylines that are easily playable not only on desktop but also on mobile devices. Together with Stan, Roger, Francine, Hayley, Wheels, and Legman, the player will have the opportunity to discover a range of bonus features that include 5 options for free spins featuring our beloved protagonists. The stakes are high with a chance to win big, ranging from 25 free spins to stacked Stan symbols, not forgetting the expanding Wilds and progressive multipliers with a maximum of 10x.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nThe graphics are obviously inspired by the cartoon series that we have all seen at least once in our life. So, in the background, we find the typical setting of Langley Falls, and the animations that alternate during gameplay are those that imitate the series. Among the low-value symbols, we have A, K and Q offered in the three colors that recall the American flag, namely red, white, and blue. But the real highlight is represented by the high-value symbols, which are represented by the protagonists of the cartoon: we find Steve and his sister Hayley, the family pet Klaus, mom Francine, and dad Stan. Precisely, the head of the family offers the highest reward of up to 250 coins if he appears five times on a payline. The Wild symbol is the alien Roger, who replaces all symbols on the reels except for the Schmooblydong bonus, which, if you form a combination of 5 symbols, is the most valuable symbol that can offer 750 coins. Bear in mind that the Schmooblydong wheel is essential for this slot: if it appears on reels 1 and 3, it gives you a new spin, and if you position it on reel 5, you can unlock the Free spin function. This determines which character you will play with, as well as the number of spins you get, ranging from a minimum of 3 to 5, 8, 10, and a maximum of 25 spins.\n\nAmong the most valid functions of the American Dad slot, we mention Roger's Random Wilds, where Wild symbols are randomly placed on each free spin, thereby increasing your chances of winning. If you are looking for a multiplier, you need to look for Hayley's progressive function, which determines the maximum win value ranging from 2x, 3x, 5x to 10x. And let's not forget the role of Wheels and Legman, who leave a trail of Wild symbols on the reels for each free spin.\n\nFinal Considerations on the American Dad Slot\nThe game's functionalities are many and precisely designed to achieve a specific goal. Playtech has done an excellent job with both graphics and animations, without neglecting the game extras that you encounter from spin to spin.\n\nThe gaming experience is undoubtedly fun and will be gratifying not only if you are a fan of the series, but because the bonuses are genuinely rewarding.\n            ",

Playtech has brought to life a slot machine about the famous family of the 'American Dad', starting from 5 reels and 40 paylines that are easily playable not only on desktop but also on mobile devices. Together with Stan, Roger, Francine, Hayley, Wheels, and Legman, the player will have the opportunity to discover a range of bonus features that include 5 options for free spins featuring our beloved protagonists. The stakes are high with a chance to win big, ranging from 25 free spins to stacked Stan symbols, not forgetting the expanding Wilds and progressive multipliers with a maximum of 10x.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nThe graphics are obviously inspired by the cartoon series that we have all seen at least once in our life. So, in the background, we find the typical setting of Langley Falls, and the animations that alternate during gameplay are those that imitate the series. Among the low-value symbols, we have A, K and Q offered in the three colors that recall the American flag, namely red, white, and blue. But the real highlight is represented by the high-value symbols, which are represented by the protagonists of the cartoon: we find Steve and his sister Hayley, the family pet Klaus, mom Francine, and dad Stan. Precisely, the head of the family offers the highest reward of up to 250 coins if he appears five times on a payline. The Wild symbol is the alien Roger, who replaces all symbols on the reels except for the Schmooblydong bonus, which, if you form a combination of 5 symbols, is the most valuable symbol that can offer 750 coins. Bear in mind that the Schmooblydong wheel is essential for this slot: if it appears on reels 1 and 3, it gives you a new spin, and if you position it on reel 5, you can unlock the Free spin function. This determines which character you will play with, as well as the number of spins you get, ranging from a minimum of 3 to 5, 8, 10, and a maximum of 25 spins.\n\nAmong the most valid functions of the American Dad slot, we mention Roger's Random Wilds, where Wild symbols are randomly placed on each free spin, thereby increasing your chances of winning. If you are looking for a multiplier, you need to look for Hayley's progressive function, which determines the maximum win value ranging from 2x, 3x, 5x to 10x. And let's not forget the role of Wheels and Legman, who leave a trail of Wild symbols on the reels for each free spin.\n\nFinal Considerations on the American Dad Slot\nThe game's functionalities are many and precisely designed to achieve a specific goal. Playtech has done an excellent job with both graphics and animations, without neglecting the game extras that you encounter from spin to spin.\n\nThe gaming experience is undoubtedly fun and will be gratifying not only if you are a fan of the series, but because the bonuses are genuinely rewarding.\n            ",

Playtech has brought to life a slot machine about the famous family of the 'American Dad', starting from 5 reels and 40 paylines that are easily playable not only on desktop but also on mobile devices. Together with Stan, Roger, Francine, Hayley, Wheels, and Legman, the player will have the opportunity to discover a range of bonus features that include 5 options for free spins featuring our beloved protagonists. The stakes are high with a chance to win big, ranging from 25 free spins to stacked Stan symbols, not forgetting the expanding Wilds and progressive multipliers with a maximum of 10x.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nThe graphics are obviously inspired by the cartoon series that we have all seen at least once in our life. So, in the background, we find the typical setting of Langley Falls, and the animations that alternate during gameplay are those that imitate the series. Among the low-value symbols, we have A, K and Q offered in the three colors that recall the American flag, namely red, white, and blue. But the real highlight is represented by the high-value symbols, which are represented by the protagonists of the cartoon: we find Steve and his sister Hayley, the family pet Klaus, mom Francine, and dad Stan. Precisely, the head of the family offers the highest reward of up to 250 coins if he appears five times on a payline. The Wild symbol is the alien Roger, who replaces all symbols on the reels except for the Schmooblydong bonus, which, if you form a combination of 5 symbols, is the most valuable symbol that can offer 750 coins. Bear in mind that the Schmooblydong wheel is essential for this slot: if it appears on reels 1 and 3, it gives you a new spin, and if you position it on reel 5, you can unlock the Free spin function. This determines which character you will play with, as well as the number of spins you get, ranging from a minimum of 3 to 5, 8, 10, and a maximum of 25 spins.\n\nAmong the most valid functions of the American Dad slot, we mention Roger's Random Wilds, where Wild symbols are randomly placed on each free spin, thereby increasing your chances of winning. If you are looking for a multiplier, you need to look for Hayley's progressive function, which determines the maximum win value ranging from 2x, 3x, 5x to 10x. And let's not forget the role of Wheels and Legman, who leave a trail of Wild symbols on the reels for each free spin.\n\nFinal Considerations on the American Dad Slot\nThe game's functionalities are many and precisely designed to achieve a specific goal. Playtech has done an excellent job with both graphics and animations, without neglecting the game extras that you encounter from spin to spin.\n\nThe gaming experience is undoubtedly fun and will be gratifying not only if you are a fan of the series, but because the bonuses are genuinely rewarding.\n            ",
