Released in October 2022, this game has quickly become a hit among fans of Mexican-themed slots for its exciting storyline and fantastic graphics.\n\nThis review details all its key features, which, along with the free test mode available on our site, will help you celebrate the Day of the Dead in style!\n\nGameplay, RTP, and payouts\n\nIt is not uncommon at this time of year to see a number of slots inspired by holidays, particularly those based on Halloween and Christmas. But it is also an opportunity for providers like Pragmatic Play to introduce us to equally important traditions from other cultures, in this case from Mexico.\n\nMuertos Multiplier Megaways is a 6-reel slot game with up to 117,649 ways to win. Winning combinations are formed when 3 or more (or 2 or more of the highest-paying symbols) appear from left to right, starting from the leftmost reel.\n\nThe minimum bet available to players is €0.20 per spin and the maximum bet available is €100 per spin, with many other betting options in between. Muertos Multiplier Megaways has a theoretical RTP of 96.03% and a maximum win capacity of 10,000x.\n\nWhat are the symbols and features of the base game?\n\nLike most Megaways titles, Muertos Multiplier features both Cascading Reels and Sliding Reel mechanics.\n\nCascading Reels – Every time a winning combination is formed, the winning symbols will be removed from the reels and new symbols will fall from above. Once a cascade occurs, the chances of getting lucky combinations increase.\n\nSliding Reels – If a winning combination is made using one or more symbols on the sliding reel, these will also be removed and all remaining symbols will slide one position to the left while new icons will fill the empty reel positions.\n\nIn terms of symbols, the most lucrative regular icon in Muertos Multiplier Megaways is the skull, followed by hot sauce, cactus, taco, nachos, and guitar. The low-value symbols are Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, and Hearts.\n\nThere is also a Wild symbol present only on the Sliding Reel, which substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter. During the base game, every time a Wild symbol appears, it will reveal a random multiplier of x2 or x3.\n\nSpecial features: Free Spins.\n\nFree Spins\n\nLanding 3, 4, 5, or 6 Scatters on the reels activates the free spins round. Before the bonus round starts, a random number of FS will be selected by a wheel;\n\nBonus Buy\n\nPragmatic Play has granted players access to free spins for a total cost of 100x your bet. The RTP when buying free spins drops slightly from 96.03% to 96.00%.\n\nMuertos Multiplier Megaways: My Considerations\n\nWith so many slots inspired by the Day of the Dead, initially, I wasn't so excited. But once the Wild Multiplier feature was activated, my perception of the game changed radically and I started having fun.\n\nAll in all, Muertos Multiplier Megaways is an interesting title, although it doesn't add anything new. If you like the genre, I suggest trying Habanero's Taberna De Los Muertos in Demo mode as well.\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I play Muertos Multiplier Megaways for free?\n\nCertainly, Slotjava.it is the perfect platform to test Muertos Multiplier Megaways without registration or game download.\n\nWhat is the Wild multiplier feature in the Muertos Multiplier Megaways slot?\n\nThe Wild symbols in the Muertos Multiplier Megaways slot have multipliers of 2x or 3x. A cascade feature removes winning symbols to potentially form new wins, and wild multipliers accumulate during any sequence.\n\nWhat is the minimum bet in the Muertos Multiplier Megaways slot?\n\nYou can play the Muertos Multiplier Megaways slot starting from €0.20 per spin. If you want to increase your stake, there are many options up to a maximum of €100. It is a wider range than many other Megaways slot machines.\n            ",

The RTP when buying free spins drops slightly from 96.03% to 96.00%.\n\nMuertos Multiplier Megaways: My Considerations\n\nWith so many slots inspired by the Day of the Dead, initially, I wasn't so excited. But once the Wild Multiplier feature was activated, my perception of the game changed radically and I started having fun.\n\nAll in all, Muertos Multiplier Megaways is an interesting title, although it doesn't add anything new. If you like the genre, I suggest trying Habanero's Taberna De Los Muertos in Demo mode as well.\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I play Muertos Multiplier Megaways for free?\n\nCertainly, Slotjava.it is the perfect platform to test Muertos Multiplier Megaways without registration or game download.\n\nWhat is the Wild multiplier feature in the Muertos Multiplier Megaways slot?\n\nThe Wild symbols in the Muertos Multiplier Megaways slot have multipliers of 2x or 3x. A cascade feature removes winning symbols to potentially form new wins, and wild multipliers accumulate during any sequence.\n\nWhat is the minimum bet in the Muertos Multiplier Megaways slot?\n\nYou can play the Muertos Multiplier Megaways slot starting from €0.20 per spin. If you want to increase your stake, there are many options up to a maximum of €100. It is a wider range than many other Megaways slot machines.\n        ",
