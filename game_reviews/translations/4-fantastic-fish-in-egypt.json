            "response": "4 Fantastic Fish In Egypt\n\nIn the new slot game titled 4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt, you'll find fantastic bonuses, a special sarcophagus, sharks, giant squids, and 4,096 ways to win! This game is a fusion of two classic themes beloved by seasoned slot players: fishing and ancient Egypt. \n\nIn the past, there was already a game called 4 Fantastic Fish, and here, the game is simply set in Egypt. Comparing the two slots, we find minimal differences in both graphics and gameplay. The game board is partially submerged in the crystal-clear waters of the Nile, and if not for the pyramids and sphinxes visible in the background, we wouldn't know we are in the land of the pharaohs. \n\nThe symbols, drawn in a cartoonish style, have soft lines and color variations that produce a three-dimensional effect. The game grid of 4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt, a little larger than usual, has 6 reels and 4 rows. This means that with every spin, we'll see 24 symbols land to form one of the 4,096 ways to win. \n\nThe basic bet is quite modest, starting from just € 0.10 and can be raised up to € 80. The maximum win is 11,100 times the bet. Autoplay is the function that activates automatic spins, with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 100. 4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt has a very high volatility and an RTP of 96%. \n\nTo win, you need to create combos of at least 3 symbols for low and medium-level ones, while with high-level symbols, you only need two. The lowest-paying symbols are the playing cards from 10 to Ace, while medium-sized prizes are obtained thanks to the fisherman's chest and fishing rod. The highest sums are won with the cat, seagull, and Cleopatra, but for a precise estimate of the amounts, it is best to access the payout table. \n\nAnother symbol is the fish, which is always associated with a sum of money. The yacht is the Wild, replacing all basic symbols to create a paying combination. The swordfish is the Scatter, and you need three to get three Respins. The reels where the Bonus symbols landed will be free, while the others will remain locked. During the whole function, we'll only have fish symbols that will remain stuck to the reels. Additionally, every time we land one, the Respin count is reset to three. The appearance of the Scatter on a locked reel frees it, while if the reel is fully covered with fish symbols, a shark will appear, eating them and multiplying the win by x2. \n\nAnother Scatter is the sarcophagus that can activate 4 functions: \n\n- Shark, which, as we've seen, collects all prizes\n- Giant squid, which changes the position of the fish to obtain wins or moves the fish from locked to free reels. \n- Collector: collects all wins without removing the fish (so they'll continue to pay out until the end of the function)\n- Value increase: increases the value of the fish. \n\nTo win the Jackpot, you need to land one of the giant fish on the sixth reel. \n\nFAQs \n- How many ways to win are there? \n- There are 4,096 ways to win. \n\n- How can I win the Jackpot? \n- To win the Jackpot, you need one of the 4 special fish to land on the sixth reel. \n\n- How can I activate the special function? \n- Either through the Scatters, or by purchasing the function.",

However, comparing the two slots, we find minor differences both in terms of graphics and gameplay. \nThe game board is partially submerged in the clear waters of the Nile, and if it weren't for the pyramids and sphinxes on the background, we wouldn't know that we are in the land of the pharaohs. The symbols, drawn in a cartoon style, have soft and colorful lines that produce a three-dimensional effect.\nGame features\nThe board of \"4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt,\" slightly larger than usual, has 6 reels and 4 rows. That means that with each spin, we will see 24 symbols land, those needed to form one of the 4,096 ways to win.\nThe basic bet is very low, starting at just €0.10 and can be raised up to €80. The maximum win is 11,100 times the bet placed. The autoplay function activates automatic spins, a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 100. \n\"4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt\" has high volatility and an RTP of 96%.\nSymbols and gameplay\nFirst of all, to win it is necessary to create combos of at least 3 symbols for the low and medium-level ones. For the high-level ones, only 2 are enough. \nThe least lucrative symbols are playing cards from ten to ace. The middle prizes are obtained thanks to the fisherman's box and fishing rod. The highest sums are won with the cat, the seagull, and Cleopatra. However, it is best to access the paytable to generate a precise estimate of the sums won.\nAnother symbol is the fish, which is always associated with a sum of money.\nThe yacht is the wild symbol and replaces all basic symbols to complete a winning combination. The swordfish is the scatter and you need 3 of them to get 3 respins. The reels on which the Bonus symbols have landed will be free, while the others will remain blocked. We will only see fish symbols that will remain stuck to the reels throughout the function. Also, every time one lands, the Respin count is reset to 3. The appearance of the Scatter on a blocked reel frees it, while if the reel is completely covered by fish, a shark will appear to eat them, multiplying the winnings by x2. \nAnother scatter is the sarcophagus that can activate 4 functions:\n- Shark, which, as we have seen, collects all prizes\n- Giant squid that switches the positions of the fish to obtain winnings, or moves the fish from blocked reels to free ones.\n- Collector: collects all the winnings without removing the fish (which will continue to pay off at the end of the function)\n- Value increase: increases the value of the fish.\nTo win the jackpot, you need to land one of the giant fish on the 6th reel.\n\nFAQ\nHow many ways are there to win?\nThere are 4,096 ways to win.\n\nHow can I win the jackpot?\nTo win the jackpot, you need one of the 4 special fish to land on the 6th reel.\n\nHow can I activate the special function?\nThrough the scatters or by purchasing the function.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay\nSymbols and Bonuses\nWinning Potential\nDesign and Graphics\nVolatility and RTP\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: 4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt\nIn the new slot game \"4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt\" you will find amazing bonuses, a special sarcophagus, sharks, giant squid and a whopping 4,096 ways to win! \nA perfect blend of classic themes\nYggdrasil, the game producer, has decided to blend two classic themes beloved by the biggest slot players: fishing and Ancient Egypt.\nIn the past there was already \"4 Fantastic Fish,\" and now the game takes place in Egypt. However, comparing the two slots, we find minor differences both in terms of graphics and gameplay. \nThe game board is partially submerged in the clear waters of the Nile, and if it weren't for the pyramids and sphinxes on the background, we wouldn't know that we are in the land of the pharaohs. The symbols, drawn in a cartoon style, have soft and colorful lines that produce a three-dimensional effect.\nGame features\nThe board of \"4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt,\" slightly larger than usual, has 6 reels and 4 rows. That means that with each spin, we will see 24 symbols land, those needed to form one of the 4,096 ways to win.\nThe basic bet is very low, starting at just €0.10 and can be raised up to €80. The maximum win is 11,100 times the bet placed. The autoplay function activates automatic spins, a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 100. \n\"4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt\" has high volatility and an RTP of 96%.\nSymbols and gameplay\nFirst of all, to win it is necessary to create combos of at least 3 symbols for the low and medium-level ones. For the high-level ones, only 2 are enough. \nThe least lucrative symbols are playing cards from ten to ace. The middle prizes are obtained thanks to the fisherman's box and fishing rod. The highest sums are won with the cat, the seagull, and Cleopatra. However, it is best to access the paytable to generate a precise estimate of the sums won.\nAnother symbol is the fish, which is always associated with a sum of money.\nThe yacht is the wild symbol and replaces all basic symbols to complete a winning combination. The swordfish is the scatter and you need 3 of them to get 3 respins. The reels on which the Bonus symbols have landed will be free, while the others will remain blocked. We will only see fish symbols that will remain stuck to the reels throughout the function. Also, every time one lands, the Respin count is reset to 3. The appearance of the Scatter on a blocked reel frees it, while if the reel is completely covered by fish, a shark will appear to eat them, multiplying the winnings by x2. \nAnother scatter is the sarcophagus that can activate 4 functions:\n- Shark, which, as we have seen, collects all prizes\n- Giant squid that switches the positions of the fish to obtain winnings, or moves the fish from blocked reels to free ones.\n- Collector: collects all the winnings without removing the fish (which will continue to pay off at the end of the function)\n- Value increase: increases the value of the fish.\nTo win the jackpot, you need to land one of the giant fish on the 6th reel.\n\nFAQ\nHow many ways are there to win?\nThere are 4,096 ways to win.\n\nHow can I win the jackpot?\nTo win the jackpot, you need one of the 4 special fish to land on the 6th reel.\n\nHow can I activate the special function?\nThrough the scatters or by purchasing the function.\n            ",

With a massive 4,096 ways to win, the game features a partially submerged game board with six reels and four rows which presents a three-dimensional effect. The game promises bonuses, a special sarcophagus, sharks, and giant squid that all enhance the gaming experience. Moreover, the game has high volatility and an RTP of 96%. \n\nDescription of the game layout and design\n\nThe game features a partially submerged game board that gives the illusion that it's situated in the clear waters of the Nile. The symbols, drawn in a cartoon style, have soft and colorful lines which produce a three-dimensional effect. There are pyramids and sphinxes in the background to complete the 'Ancient Egypt' theme. The game board is slightly larger than usual, with six reels and four rows instead of the conventional layout. \n\nDetails about game mechanics and RTP\n\nThe 4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt slot game has 4,096 ways to win. The game has high volatility, and the RTP is 96%. The base bet of the game is €0.10, which can be increased up to €80. The maximum win is 11,100 times the amount placed on the bet. The game has an autoplay feature which allows automatic spins, with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 100. \n\nExplanation of special symbols and features\n\nThere are several special symbols and features in the 4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt slot game. The yacht is the wild symbol, while the swordfish is the scatter that triggers three respins when you land three of them. The reels on which the bonus symbols have landed will be free, while the other reels will remain blocked. Only fish symbols will remain stuck to the reels throughout the function. Also, every time a fish lands, the respin count is reset to three. The appearance of a scatter on a blocked reel frees it. If the reel is completely covered by fish, a shark appears to eat them, multiplying the winnings by x2. The sarcophagus is a scatter that activates up to four functions: shark, giant squid, collector, and value increase. Finally, to win the jackpot, one needs to land one of the giant fish on the sixth reel. \n\nInformation about how to win the game jackpot\n\nTo win the 4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt slot game jackpot, you need to land one of the giant fish on the sixth reel. \n\n        \n            ",

However, comparing the two slots, we find minor differences both in terms of graphics and gameplay. \nThe game board is partially submerged in the clear waters of the Nile, and if it weren't for the pyramids and sphinxes on the background, we wouldn't know that we are in the land of the pharaohs. The symbols, drawn in a cartoon style, have soft and colorful lines that produce a three-dimensional effect.\nGame features\nThe board of \"4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt,\" slightly larger than usual, has 6 reels and 4 rows. That means that with each spin, we will see 24 symbols land, those needed to form one of the 4,096 ways to win.\nThe basic bet is very low, starting at just €0.10 and can be raised up to €80. The maximum win is 11,100 times the bet placed. The autoplay function activates automatic spins, a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 100. \n\"4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt\" has high volatility and an RTP of 96%.\nSymbols and gameplay\nFirst of all, to win it is necessary to create combos of at least 3 symbols for the low and medium-level ones.

However, comparing the two slots, we find minor differences both in terms of graphics and gameplay. \nThe game board is partially submerged in the clear waters of the Nile, and if it weren't for the pyramids and sphinxes on the background, we wouldn't know that we are in the land of the pharaohs. The symbols, drawn in a cartoon style, have soft and colorful lines that produce a three-dimensional effect.\nGame features\nThe board of \"4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt,\" slightly larger than usual, has 6 reels and 4 rows. That means that with each spin, we will see 24 symbols land, those needed to form one of the 4,096 ways to win.\nThe basic bet is very low, starting at just €0.10 and can be raised up to €80. The maximum win is 11,100 times the bet placed. The autoplay function activates automatic spins, a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 100. \n\"4 Fantastic Fish in Egypt\" has high volatility and an RTP of 96%.\nSymbols and gameplay\nFirst of all, to win it is necessary to create combos of at least 3 symbols for the low and medium-level ones. For the high-level ones, only 2 are enough. \nThe least lucrative symbols are playing cards from ten to ace. The middle prizes are obtained thanks to the fisherman's box and fishing rod. The highest sums are won with the cat, the seagull, and Cleopatra. However, it is best to access the paytable to generate a precise estimate of the sums won.\nAnother symbol is the fish, which is always associated with a sum of money.\nThe yacht is the wild symbol and replaces all basic symbols to complete a winning combination.
