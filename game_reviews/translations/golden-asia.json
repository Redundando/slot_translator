There are 20 fixed paylines among the 15 symbols in Golden Asia. A winning combination consists of 3 or more identical symbols on a payline. \n\nGolden Asia RTP, Betting, and Variance\nWhen it comes to payout percentages, we often come across the abbreviation RTP, which stands for Return To Player. Golden Asia's payout percentage is one of the advantages of this game, 96.62% is indeed a value above average. If you want to play Golden Asia, you can do so by betting up to a maximum of €100 per spin. If you prefer to play with a lower budget, you can lower your bet to a minimum of 20 cents per spin.\n\nWhat to Watch Out For?\nThe wild symbol in Golden Asia is the white tiger. This symbol can substitute for all other symbols except the two scatters. Bonus symbols - Rotating three or more river-shaped scatter symbols, you win a spin on the wheel. This allows you to win a cash prize or access to Action Spins.\n\nWhat are Action Spins?\nAction Spins are made up of a small wheel that you must spin to win guaranteed prizes. Spin 6 golden pots and you can choose between accessing action spins or free spins! There is a multiplier ranging from 1x to up to 2000x. This allows you to win fantastic prizes.\n\nScatters and Wild Symbols\nThere are 3 scatters not to be missed in the Golden Asia slot. The black pot and the golden pot work together and each will have a value assigned to them. You need to find 6 of these symbols to unlock a bonus game of your choice: 3 action spins or regular free spins with wilds. Also, land 3 of the river scatters and you'll have the chance to spin the wheel. The wild symbol is a magnificent white tiger that replaces regular symbols to increase your wins.\n\nGolden Asia Bonus Game\nThere are two bonus rounds to choose from after revealing 6 scatter scatters:\n\nIn the first bonus game, you will win free spins with extra wilds to play with. The number of pots on the screen is the number of free spins you unlock;\nThe second bonus game will give you 3 action spins to play with. You will get fewer free spins, but this round plays with multipliers of 0.5x and 1.5x. The black pot will increase your win by 0.5x, while the golden pot will increase your win by 1.5x.\n\nWhere to Play Golden Asia\nYou can travel to India in many popular online casinos with just a click of a button.
