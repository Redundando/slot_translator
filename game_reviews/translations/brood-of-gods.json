Puoi farlo attraverso una slot online firmata da Light & Wonder che vuole sviluppare le bellezze di un mondo antico, fatto di divinità Maori. La slot si presenta con 5 rulli e pagamenti a grappolo, con un potenziale di vincita pari a 1.789 volte la tua scommessa e un RTP al 95,99%. È ricca di funzioni entusiasmanti, tra cui un simbolo Jolly, una moneta che funge da moltiplicatore e gli immancabili giri gratuiti.\nSei pronto a scoprire come si comporteranno Papa, Rangi e Whiro all’interno della griglia di gioco 5×5 con questo sistema di vittoria a grappolo? Scopri di più!\nGrafica della slot Brood of Gods\nIl dettaglio più interessante della slot Brood of Gods è legato alla possibilità di entrare in diversi ambienti di gioco in base al Dio che è protagonista al momento. In un primo momento, nel gioco base siamo di fronte a una foresta verde, ai piedi della Dea Papa, che viene poi seguita da Rangi e il dio Whiro.\nOvviamente sono proprio le 3 divinità a rappresentare anche i simboli con maggior valore nel gioco, pronti a pagare 10 volte la puntata per vincite. Ma oltre a loro esiste anche un Wild (W) che permette di sostituire tutte le icone del gioco.\nCaratteristiche di gioco e funzioni\nCi sembra molto interessante il ruolo chiave della moneta che funge da moltiplicatore: puoi raccogliere monete e aumentare così il valore da 0,1 a 5x per potenziare il totale della vincita. Se raccogli 4 monete in un giro entri nella funzione Free Spin, ricevendo 5 giri gratis fino a un massimo di 10.\nDurante il gioco una delle 3 divinità è sempre attiva e ha delle caratteristiche precise sul gameplay: Papa per esempio è legata ai fiori e può trasformare i simboli che colpisce in simboli casuali. Rangi seleziona una parte della griglia di gioco 2×2 e trasforma quei simboli nella stessa icona casuale. Infine Whiro blocca un simbolo casuale sulla griglia e ne sostituisce altri per riempire i rulli aumentando le chance di vincita.\nConsiderazioni finali\nSicuramente la slot Brood of Gods e questo suo spirito Maori sono un modo interessante per sperimentare un tipo di slot tutt’altro che tipico. È ben studiato il gameplay e ogni funzione aggiuntiva, a partire dai giri gratuiti che riescono a vivacizzare il gioco insieme alla divinità prescelta.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nQual è la vincita massima che si ottiene con la slot Brood of Gods?\n\nIl valore massimo della vincita potenziale su questa slot è di 1.789 volte la tua scommessa.\n\n\n\nLa slot online ha delle funzionalità bonus?\n\nSì, ci sono 3 divinità che giocano un ruolo centrale sulle funzionalità del gioco, ma è piacevole anche la funzione moltiplicatori e quella dei giri gratis.\n\n\n\nPosso giocare alla slot Brood of Gods gratis?\n\nSì, puoi sfruttare la sua versione demo direttamente nei migliori casinò online, oppure la trovi qui sul nostro portale.\n\n\n\n",

Come and explore their world!\n\nBrood of Gods: Graphics\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Brood of Gods is the possibility of entering different game environments based on which god or goddess is currently in charge. At the outset, we find ourselves in a lush green forest at the feet of the goddess Papa, followed by Rangi and the god Whiro.\n\nThese three deities also happen to be the game's highest-paying symbols, offering up to ten times your bet. But don't worry if you miss them! The slot also features a wild (W) symbol that can substitute for any other icon in the game.\n\nBrood of Gods: Gameplay and Features\nWe especially like the coin's role as a multiplier, which allows you to collect coins and increase your winnings from 0.1x to 5x. Collect four coins in a single spin, and you'll trigger the free spin feature, where you can earn up to ten bonus spins.\n\nDuring gameplay, one of the three gods or goddesses is always active, with unique abilities that enhance the game.

The gameplay is well-designed, and each added feature - from the free spins to the selected deity - enhances the game's liveliness.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the maximum payout for Brood of Gods?\n\nThe maximum payout for this slot is 1,789 times your bet.\n\nDoes Brood of Gods have bonus features?\n\nYes, the game features three central deities - Papa, Rangi, and Whiro - and also includes a multiplying coin and free spin rounds.\n\nCan I play Brood of Gods for free?\n\nYes, you can find a demo version of the game at top online casinos, or right here on our portal.\n            ",

The game features a wild symbol, a multiplying coin, and free spins. One of the most exciting features is the coin's role as a multiplier, which allows you to collect coins and increase your winnings from 0.1x to 50x.\n\nPotential payouts and RTP\n\nThe game offers a potential payout of up to 1,789 times your bet, with an RTP of 95.99%.\n\nGraphics and aesthetics\n\nBrood of Gods features an intruiging world full of Maori gods and goddesses. It features stunning graphics and animation that transport players on a journey through lush green forests, celestial skies and volcanic terrain. The game also features a captivating soundtrack that complements the overall aesthetic of the game experience.\n\nUnique abilities of different gods and goddesses\n\nDuring gameplay, one of the three gods or goddesses is always active, with unique abilities that enhance the game. For example, Papa is associated with flowers and can turn any symbols she touches into random symbols. Rangi selects a 2x2 grid within the game and transforms those symbols into the same random icon.

This game takes you on a journey through an ancient world filled with Maori gods and goddesses. With five reels and cluster payouts, the game offers a potential payout of up to 1,789 times your bet, with an RTP of 95.99%. Brood of Gods is packed with exciting features, including a wild symbol, a multiplying coin, and, of course, free spins.\n\nAre you ready to discover what Papa, Rangi, and Whiro have in store for you on the 5x5 grid of this unique game? Come and explore their world!\n\nBrood of Gods: Graphics\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Brood of Gods is the possibility of entering different game environments based on which god or goddess is currently in charge. At the outset, we find ourselves in a lush green forest at the feet of the goddess Papa, followed by Rangi and the god Whiro.\n\nThese three deities also happen to be the game's highest-paying symbols, offering up to ten times your bet. But don't worry if you miss them! The slot also features a wild (W) symbol that can substitute for any other icon in the game.\n\nBrood of Gods: Gameplay and Features\nWe especially like the coin's role as a multiplier, which allows you to collect coins and increase your winnings from 0.1x to 5x. Collect four coins in a single spin, and you'll trigger the free spin feature, where you can earn up to ten bonus spins.\n\nDuring gameplay, one of the three gods or goddesses is always active, with unique abilities that enhance the game. For example, Papa is associated with flowers and can turn any symbols she touches into random symbols. Rangi selects a 2x2 grid within the game and transforms those symbols into the same random icon. Finally, Whiro blocks a random symbol on the grid and substitutes others to fill the reels, expanding your chances of winning big.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBrood of Gods and its Maori spirit are a refreshing twist on traditional slot games. The gameplay is well-designed, and each added feature - from the free spins to the selected deity - enhances the game's liveliness.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the maximum payout for Brood of Gods?\n\nThe maximum payout for this slot is 1,789 times your bet.\n\nDoes Brood of Gods have bonus features?\n\nYes, the game features three central deities - Papa, Rangi, and Whiro - and also includes a multiplying coin and free spin rounds.\n\nCan I play Brood of Gods for free?\n\nYes, you can find a demo version of the game at top online casinos, or right here on our portal.\n        ",
