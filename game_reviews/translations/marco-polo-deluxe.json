    "original_text": "\nMarco Polo Deluxe\nAnche se il famoso esploratore Marco Polo ha dovuto attraversare il mondo conosciuto per trovare la sua fortuna, fortunatamente per noi, ora possiamo cercare di atterrare la nostra (piccola) fortuna senza lasciare il divano. La video slot Marco Polo Deluxe di Novomatic è un gioco a tema avventuroso che si svolge su cinque rulli e dieci linee di pagamento, dove si possono trovare ricchi premi come giri gratis con moltiplicatori di vincita in aumento e cammelli selvatici. Fai atterrare il nostro intrepido esploratore proprio attraverso una linea di pagamento attiva per raccogliere un premio di 500x la posta in gioco totale. Potrebbe non renderti ricco come Marco Polo, ma ti dà comunque una vincita abbastanza decente.\nChiunque abbia giocato a una slot machine di Novomatic saprà che questo sviluppatore austriaco è un po’ indietro rispetto ad altri per quanto riguarda l’appeal visivo dei suoi giochi. Marco Polo Deluxe vi offre alcuni simboli di carattere semi-realistici più mappe, scatole del tesoro e le icone delle carte alte, ma non è esattamente lo stato dell’arte. Se speravi in una colonna sonora impressionante che catturasse l’avventura di esplorare nuove terre, ripensaci. È solo una generica serie di rumori tipo macchina della frutta. Ma se si guarda oltre, pensiamo che Marco Polo Deluxe abbia molto da fare.\nUna grafica da veri esploratori\nCome tutti i giochi Novomatic, è completamente equo e affidabile, con un’alta percentuale di ritorno al giocatore di oltre il 95%. È possibile collezionare vittorie regolari mentre i rulli ruotano da sinistra a destra attraverso qualsiasi linea di pagamento, e anche se le caratteristiche potrebbero non essere particolarmente innovative, c’è la possibilità di rivendicare alcune grandi vittorie nel gioco gratuito.\nL’unico passo da compiere per intraprendere quest’avventura è quello di entrare in un casinò sicuro e raccomandato che utilizza il software Novomatic, effettuare un deposito e caricare il gioco. Potete anche provare le video slot gratuite Marco Polo Deluxe, ma il punto di partenza per giocare con denaro reale è solo 0,10 per giro. In comune con molte slot machine, le combinazioni vincenti più piccole ma più frequenti sono create dai simboli delle carte da gioco 10, J, Q, K, e A. Queste sono tutte icone colorate che hanno ricevuto un sottile stile cinese per aiutarle ad adattarsi al tema generale.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nOgnuno di questi simboli dovrà atterrare sulle bobine uno, due e tre attraverso una linea per poter valere qualcosa, ma i simboli delle immagini che pagano di più devono essere visti solo sulle prime due bobine per pagare un premio. La mappa paga fino a 25x il palo, lo scrigno del tesoro vale fino a 50x, e Kublai Khan – l’imperatore che ha ospitato Marco Polo nei suoi viaggi – paga fino a 100x. I premi più importanti provengono da Marco Polo stesso, che condivide con voi la sua ricchezza pagando un alto limite di 500x la puntata quando attraversa una linea di pagamento.\nMarco Polo è anche un simbolo selvaggio. È in grado di sostituire tutti i simboli, tranne i cammelli, se poi può completare una combinazione per voi, o estendere una vincita su più bobine per una vincita più alta.\nI cammelli sono noti per essere creature lunatici, ma il delizioso dromedario su questi rulli dovrebbe rallegrare la vostra giornata quando atterra in tre o più posti in un solo giro. È un simbolo di spargimento che inizialmente ti premia con dieci giri gratis. Qualsiasi vittoria durante questi giochi viene raddoppiata in valore, e con un altro cammello che funge da secondo simbolo selvatico, è un po’ più facile raccogliere qualche premio.\nSe il bonus round viene recuperato da tre o più simboli scatter di cammelli in vista, tutte le vittorie nei prossimi dieci giochi saranno triplicate in valore. Recuperarli di nuovo per quadruplicare i premi, e così via. Non c’è un limite massimo al numero di volte che i giochi gratuiti possono essere recuperati. Ma essendo realistici, sarete fortunati ad avere più di 20 o 30 giochi bonus in totale.\nCon un intervallo di puntate che va da 0,10 con tutte le linee attive, ad un massimo di 100,00, la maggior parte dei giocatori troveranno un livello ideale per loro quando girano le bobine di Marco Polo Deluxe. Si tratta di un semplice pulsante di comando che basta cliccare fino a raggiungere la dimensione di scommessa desiderata, e c’è un pulsante simile per determinare quante delle dieci linee di pagamento si desidera attivare. Se è possibile, si dovrebbe sempre giocare tutte le linee e regolare l’importo della puntata in base al proprio budget.\nLa slot Marco Polo Deluxe è dotata anche di un’opzione Autoplay. Si tratta di un’altra funzione di comando molto semplice che inizia con un click e prosegue fino a quando non si decide di fermare i testacoda con un altro click.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nSe vi piace lo stile di questo gioco, allora dovreste far girare i cinque rulli di The Voyages of Sinbad, una slot del casinò online da 1x2Gaming che porta il tema dell’esplorazione a nuovi livelli. È pieno di creature mitiche, più giri gratis con vittorie raddoppiate di valore e un simbolo di dispersione extra in gioco in tutta la funzione.\nMa se è il gameplay che vi attira a Marco Polo Deluxe, allora la slot Hat Trick, anch’essa di Novomatic, ha giri bonus praticamente identici, insieme al layout a cinque rulli e dieci linee a pagamento. Ha anche un tema magico che piacerà a molti giocatori.\n",

            "response": "Marco Polo Deluxe\nAs an experienced gambler, you know that fortune favors the bold. And what better way to seek that fortune than from the comfort of your own couch? Novomatic's Marco Polo Deluxe video slot takes you on an adventure through five reels and ten pay lines, offering rich prizes such as free spins with increasing win multipliers and wild camels. Land our intrepid explorer on an active pay line to claim a prize of 500x the total bet stake. It may not make you as rich as Marco Polo, but it's still a pretty decent win.\n\nNovomatic has a reputation for lacking the visual appeal of other developers, and unfortunately, Marco Polo Deluxe is no exception. The game features some semi-realistic character symbols along with maps, treasure boxes, and high card icons, but it's not exactly state of the art. If you were hoping for a breathtaking soundtrack to capture the adventure of exploring new lands, think again. It's just a generic series of fruit machine sounds. But if you look beyond that, we think Marco Polo Deluxe has plenty to offer.\n\nRealistic Explorer Graphics\nLike all Novomatic games, it's completely fair and reliable, with a high return-to-player percentage of over 95%. You can collect regular wins as the reels spin from left to right across any pay line, and while the features may not be particularly innovative, there's still a chance to claim some big wins in the free game.\n\nThe only step you need to take to embark on this adventure is to enter a safe and reputable casino that uses Novomatic software, make a deposit, and load the game. You can also try the free Marco Polo Deluxe video slots, but the starting point for playing with real money is only 0.10 per spin. Like many slot machines, the smaller but more frequent winning combinations are created by the high-card symbols, 10, J, Q, K, and A. These are all colorful icons that have received a subtle Chinese style to help them fit into the general theme.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nEach of these symbols must land on reels one, two, and three across a payline to be of any value, but the higher-paying picture symbols can only be seen on the first two reels to pay a prize. The map pays up to 25x the stake, the treasure chest is worth up to 50x and Kublai Khan - the emperor who hosted Marco Polo on his travels - pays up to 100x. The biggest prizes come from Marco Polo himself, who shares his wealth with you by paying a high limit of 500x the bet when crossing a payline.\n\nMarco Polo is also a wild symbol, able to replace all symbols except camels. If he can complete a combination for you, or extend a win across more reels for a higher win.\n\nCamels are known to be temperamental creatures, but the delightful dromedary on these reels should brighten up your day when it lands in three or more places in a single spin. It's a scatter symbol that initially rewards you with ten free spins. Any wins during these games are doubled in value, and with another camel acting as a second wild symbol, it's a little easier to collect some prizes.\n\nIf the bonus round is triggered by three or more camel scatter symbols in view, all wins in the next ten games will be tripled in value. Trigger them again to quadruple the prizes, and so on. There is no maximum limit to the number of times free games can be triggered. But being realistic, you'll be lucky to have more than 20 or 30 bonus games in total.\n\nWith a betting range that starts with 0.10 with all lines active, up to a maximum of 100.00, most players will find an ideal level for them when spinning the reels of Marco Polo Deluxe. It's a simple command button that just needs to be clicked until you reach the desired bet size, and there's a similar button to determine how many of the ten pay lines you want to activate. If you can, you should always play all lines and adjust the amount of the bet based on your budget.\n\nThe Marco Polo Deluxe slot also features an Autoplay option. It's another very simple command feature that starts with a click and continues until you decide to stop the reels with another click.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you like the style of this game, then you should spin the five reels of The Voyages of Sinbad, a 1x2Gaming online casino slot that takes the exploration theme to new levels. It's full of mythical creatures, more free spins with doubled win values, and an extra scatter symbol in play throughout the feature.\n\nBut if it's the gameplay that appeals to you in Marco Polo Deluxe, then Novomatic's Hat Trick slot has virtually identical bonus spins, along with the five-reel, ten-payline layout. It also has a magical theme that will appeal to many players.",

The Novomatic video slot Marco Polo Deluxe is an adventurous themed game played on five reels and ten paylines, where you can find rich prizes like free spins with increasing win multipliers and wild camels. Land our intrepid explorer right through an active payline and collect a prize of 500x the total bet. It may not make you as rich as Marco Polo, but it still gives you a decent win.\n\nAnyone who has played a Novomatic slot machine will know that this Austrian developer is a bit behind compared to others in terms of the visual appeal of its games. Marco Polo Deluxe offers some semi-realistic character symbols plus maps, treasure chests, and high card icons, but it's not exactly state-of-the-art. If you were hoping for an impressive soundtrack that captured the adventure of exploring new lands, think again. It's just a generic series of fruit machine-like noises. But if you look beyond that, we think Marco Polo Deluxe has a lot to offer.\n\nGraphics for real explorers\nLike all Novomatic games, it's completely fair and reliable, with a high return to player percentage of over 95%. You can collect regular wins as the reels spin from left to right across any payline, and even if the features may not be particularly innovative, there's a chance to claim some big wins in the free game.\n\nThe only step to take to undertake this adventure is to enter a safe and recommended casino that uses Novomatic software, make a deposit, and load the game. You can also try the free video slots of Marco Polo Deluxe, but the starting point for playing with real money is only 0.10 per spin. In common with many slot machines, the smaller but more frequent winning combinations are created by the playing card symbols 10, J, Q, K, and A. These are all colorful icons that have received a subtle Chinese style to help them fit into the overall theme.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nEach of these symbols must land on reels one, two, and three through a line to be worth anything, but the higher paying picture symbols must be seen on the first two reels only to pay a prize. The map pays up to 25x the stake, the treasure chest is worth up to 50x, and Kublai Khan - the emperor who hosted Marco Polo on his travels - pays up to 100x. The biggest prizes come from Marco Polo himself, who shares his wealth with you by paying a high limit of 500x the bet when he crosses a payline.\n\nMarco Polo is also a wild symbol. He can replace all symbols except camels, and if he can complete a combination for you or extend a win across multiple reels for a higher win.\n\nCamels are known to be moody creatures, but the delightful dromedary on these reels should brighten your day when it lands in three or more places in one spin. It's a scatter symbol that initially rewards you with ten free spins. Any win during these games is doubled in value, and with another camel as a second wild symbol, it's a bit easier to collect some prizes.\n\nIf the bonus round is triggered by three or more camel scatter symbols in view, all wins in the next ten games will be tripled in value. Trigger them again to quadruple your prizes, and so on. There is no maximum limit to how many times the free games can be triggered. But being realistic, you will be lucky to have more than 20 or 30 bonus games in total.\n\nWith a betting range that goes from 0.10 with all lines active up to a maximum of 100.00, most players will find an ideal level for them when spinning the reels of Marco Polo Deluxe. It's a simple command button that you just click until you reach the desired bet size, and there's a similar button to determine how many of the ten paylines you want to activate. If possible, you should always play all lines and adjust the bet amount based on your budget.\n\nThe Marco Polo Deluxe slot also features an Autoplay option. It's another very simple command feature that starts with a click and continues until you decide to stop the engine with another click.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the style of this game, then you should spin the five reels of The Voyages of Sinbad, a 1x2Gaming online casino slot that takes the exploration theme to new heights. It's full of mythical creatures, more free spins with doubled value wins, and an extra scatter symbol in play throughout the feature.\n\nBut if it's the gameplay that attracts you to Marco Polo Deluxe, then the Hat Trick slot, also from Novomatic, has virtually identical bonus spins, along with the five reels and ten paylines layout. It also has a magical theme that will appeal to many players."

These are all colorful icons that have received a subtle Chinese style to help them fit into the overall theme.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nEach of these symbols must land on reels one, two, and three through a line to be worth anything, but the higher paying picture symbols must be seen on the first two reels only to pay a prize. The map pays up to 25x the stake, the treasure chest is worth up to 50x, and Kublai Khan - the emperor who hosted Marco Polo on his travels - pays up to 100x. The biggest prizes come from Marco Polo himself, who shares his wealth with you by paying a high limit of 500x the bet when he crosses a payline.\n\nMarco Polo is also a wild symbol. He can replace all symbols except camels, and if he can complete a combination for you or extend a win across multiple reels for a higher win.\n\nCamels are known to be moody creatures, but the delightful dromedary on these reels should brighten your day when it lands in three or more places in one spin. It's a scatter symbol that initially rewards you with ten free spins. Any win during these games is doubled in value, and with another camel as a second wild symbol, it's a bit easier to collect some prizes.\n\nIf the bonus round is triggered by three or more camel scatter symbols in view, all wins in the next ten games will be tripled in value. Trigger them again to quadruple your prizes, and so on. There is no maximum limit to how many times the free games can be triggered. But being realistic, you will be lucky to have more than 20 or 30 bonus games in total.\n\nWith a betting range that goes from 0.10 with all lines active up to a maximum of 100.00, most players will find an ideal level for them when spinning the reels of Marco Polo Deluxe. It's a simple command button that you just click until you reach the desired bet size, and there's a similar button to determine how many of the ten paylines you want to activate. If possible, you should always play all lines and adjust the bet amount based on your budget.\n\nThe Marco Polo Deluxe slot also features an Autoplay option. It's another very simple command feature that starts with a click and continues until you decide to stop the engine with another click.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the style of this game, then you should spin the five reels of The Voyages of Sinbad, a 1x2Gaming online casino slot that takes the exploration theme to new heights. It's full of mythical creatures, more free spins with doubled value wins, and an extra scatter symbol in play throughout the feature.\n\nBut if it's the gameplay that attracts you to Marco Polo Deluxe, then the Hat Trick slot, also from Novomatic, has virtually identical bonus spins, along with the five reels and ten paylines layout. It also has a magical theme that will appeal to many players.\n            ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame overview\nFeatures\nReturn to player percentage\nBetting range\nAutoplay option\nOther Novomatic games\nSimilar games\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Marco Polo Deluxe\nEven though the famous explorer Marco Polo had to travel the known world to find his fortune, luckily for us, now we can try to land our (small) fortune without leaving the couch. The Novomatic video slot Marco Polo Deluxe is an adventurous themed game played on five reels and ten paylines, where you can find rich prizes like free spins with increasing win multipliers and wild camels. Land our intrepid explorer right through an active payline and collect a prize of 500x the total bet. It may not make you as rich as Marco Polo, but it still gives you a decent win.\n\nAnyone who has played a Novomatic slot machine will know that this Austrian developer is a bit behind compared to others in terms of the visual appeal of its games. Marco Polo Deluxe offers some semi-realistic character symbols plus maps, treasure chests, and high card icons, but it's not exactly state-of-the-art. If you were hoping for an impressive soundtrack that captured the adventure of exploring new lands, think again. It's just a generic series of fruit machine-like noises. But if you look beyond that, we think Marco Polo Deluxe has a lot to offer.\n\nGraphics for real explorers\nLike all Novomatic games, it's completely fair and reliable, with a high return to player percentage of over 95%. You can collect regular wins as the reels spin from left to right across any payline, and even if the features may not be particularly innovative, there's a chance to claim some big wins in the free game.\n\nThe only step to take to undertake this adventure is to enter a safe and recommended casino that uses Novomatic software, make a deposit, and load the game. You can also try the free video slots of Marco Polo Deluxe, but the starting point for playing with real money is only 0.10 per spin. In common with many slot machines, the smaller but more frequent winning combinations are created by the playing card symbols 10, J, Q, K, and A.

The biggest prizes come from Marco Polo himself, who shares his wealth with you by paying a high limit of 500x the bet when he crosses a payline.\n\nMarco Polo is also a wild symbol. He can replace all symbols except camels, and if he can complete a combination for you or extend a win across multiple reels for a higher win.\n\nCamels are known to be moody creatures, but the delightful dromedary on these reels should brighten your day when it lands in three or more places in one spin. It's a scatter symbol that initially rewards you with ten free spins. Any win during these games is doubled in value, and with another camel as a second wild symbol, it's a bit easier to collect some prizes.\n\nIf the bonus round is triggered by three or more camel scatter symbols in view, all wins in the next ten games will be tripled in value. Trigger them again to quadruple your prizes, and so on. There is no maximum limit to how many times the free games can be triggered. But being realistic, you will be lucky to have more than 20 or 30 bonus games in total.\n\nWith a betting range that goes from 0.10 with all lines active up to a maximum of 100.00, most players will find an ideal level for them when spinning the reels of Marco Polo Deluxe. It's a simple command button that you just click until you reach the desired bet size, and there's a similar button to determine how many of the ten paylines you want to activate.

Features include free spins with increasing win multipliers and wild camels, and the chance to win up to 500x the total bet when the explorer symbol crosses an active payline. The slot's autoplay option makes it easy to spin the reels without manual intervention.\n\nReliability and Fairness\n\nAs a Novomatic game, Marco Polo Deluxe is completely fair and reliable. The Austrian developer has a reputation for creating high-quality games with above-average return to player percentages, and this slot is no exception, with a RTP of over 95%.\n\nReturn to Player Percentage\n\nMarco Polo Deluxe has a high return to player percentage of over 95%. This makes it an attractive option for those looking to maximize their chances of winning while playing online slots.\n\nBetting Range\n\nThe betting range for Marco Polo Deluxe starts at 0.10 per spin, making it accessible to players with a range of budgets. The maximum bet is 100.00, making it suitable for high rollers as well. Players can adjust the bet size and number of paylines to suit their preferences.\n\nAutoplay Option\n\nMarco Polo Deluxe features an autoplay option, allowing players to spin the reels without manual intervention. This feature is simple to use and can help players to save time and increase their chances of winning.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nPlayers who enjoy Marco Polo Deluxe may also appreciate similar themed slot machines, such as The Voyages of Sinbad, which features more free spins with doubled value wins, and the Hat Trick slot, which has virtually identical bonus spins and a magical theme.\n\nTheme and Design\n\nMarco Polo Deluxe is an adventurous themed video slot game. While the graphics are not state-of-the-art, the game offers some semi-realistic character symbols, maps, treasure chests, and high card icons. The playing card symbols have a subtle Chinese style, which fits well with the overall theme. The generic series of fruit machine-like noises may disappoint those looking for an impressive soundtrack capturing the adventure of exploring new lands.\n\n        \n            ",

Players can adjust their bets on the command button according to their playing style and budget.\n\nAutoplay Option\n\nThe game features an Autoplay option, which players can activate with a simple click and stop with another click. This feature allows players more hands-free gameplay, with the betting amount and number of paylines remaining constant during the spins.\n\nOther Novomatic Games\n\nPlayers who enjoy Marco Polo Deluxe's gameplay can expect similar action in Hat Trick, another Novomatic game with nearly the same layout and bonus features. However, if they crave mythical creatures and more significant wins, they can try The Voyages of Sinbad, a 1x2Gaming game that innovates on the exploration theme.\n\n        \n            ",

The Novomatic video slot Marco Polo Deluxe is an adventurous themed game played on five reels and ten paylines, where you can find rich prizes like free spins with increasing win multipliers and wild camels. Land our intrepid explorer right through an active payline and collect a prize of 500x the total bet. It may not make you as rich as Marco Polo, but it still gives you a decent win.\n\nAnyone who has played a Novomatic slot machine will know that this Austrian developer is a bit behind compared to others in terms of the visual appeal of its games. Marco Polo Deluxe offers some semi-realistic character symbols plus maps, treasure chests, and high card icons, but it's not exactly state-of-the-art. If you were hoping for an impressive soundtrack that captured the adventure of exploring new lands, think again. It's just a generic series of fruit machine-like noises. But if you look beyond that, we think Marco Polo Deluxe has a lot to offer.\n\nGraphics for real explorers\nLike all Novomatic games, it's completely fair and reliable, with a high return to player percentage of over 95%. You can collect regular wins as the reels spin from left to right across any payline, and even if the features may not be particularly innovative, there's a chance to claim some big wins in the free game.\n\nThe only step to take to undertake this adventure is to enter a safe and recommended casino that uses Novomatic software, make a deposit, and load the game. You can also try the free video slots of Marco Polo Deluxe, but the starting point for playing with real money is only 0.10 per spin. In common with many slot machines, the smaller but more frequent winning combinations are created by the playing card symbols 10, J, Q, K, and A. These are all colorful icons that have received a subtle Chinese style to help them fit into the overall theme.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nEach of these symbols must land on reels one, two, and three through a line to be worth anything, but the higher paying picture symbols must be seen on the first two reels only to pay a prize. The map pays up to 25x the stake, the treasure chest is worth up to 50x, and Kublai Khan - the emperor who hosted Marco Polo on his travels - pays up to 100x. The biggest prizes come from Marco Polo himself, who shares his wealth with you by paying a high limit of 500x the bet when he crosses a payline.\n\nMarco Polo is also a wild symbol. He can replace all symbols except camels, and if he can complete a combination for you or extend a win across multiple reels for a higher win.\n\nCamels are known to be moody creatures, but the delightful dromedary on these reels should brighten your day when it lands in three or more places in one spin. It's a scatter symbol that initially rewards you with ten free spins. Any win during these games is doubled in value, and with another camel as a second wild symbol, it's a bit easier to collect some prizes.\n\nIf the bonus round is triggered by three or more camel scatter symbols in view, all wins in the next ten games will be tripled in value. Trigger them again to quadruple your prizes, and so on. There is no maximum limit to how many times the free games can be triggered. But being realistic, you will be lucky to have more than 20 or 30 bonus games in total.\n\nWith a betting range that goes from 0.10 with all lines active up to a maximum of 100.00, most players will find an ideal level for them when spinning the reels of Marco Polo Deluxe. It's a simple command button that you just click until you reach the desired bet size, and there's a similar button to determine how many of the ten paylines you want to activate. If possible, you should always play all lines and adjust the bet amount based on your budget.\n\nThe Marco Polo Deluxe slot also features an Autoplay option. It's another very simple command feature that starts with a click and continues until you decide to stop the engine with another click.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the style of this game, then you should spin the five reels of The Voyages of Sinbad, a 1x2Gaming online casino slot that takes the exploration theme to new heights. It's full of mythical creatures, more free spins with doubled value wins, and an extra scatter symbol in play throughout the feature.\n\nBut if it's the gameplay that attracts you to Marco Polo Deluxe, then the Hat Trick slot, also from Novomatic, has virtually identical bonus spins, along with the five reels and ten paylines layout. It also has a magical theme that will appeal to many players.\n            ",

The Novomatic video slot Marco Polo Deluxe is an adventurous themed game played on five reels and ten paylines, where you can find rich prizes like free spins with increasing win multipliers and wild camels. Land our intrepid explorer right through an active payline and collect a prize of 500x the total bet. It may not make you as rich as Marco Polo, but it still gives you a decent win.\n\nAnyone who has played a Novomatic slot machine will know that this Austrian developer is a bit behind compared to others in terms of the visual appeal of its games. Marco Polo Deluxe offers some semi-realistic character symbols plus maps, treasure chests, and high card icons, but it's not exactly state-of-the-art. If you were hoping for an impressive soundtrack that captured the adventure of exploring new lands, think again. It's just a generic series of fruit machine-like noises. But if you look beyond that, we think Marco Polo Deluxe has a lot to offer.\n\nGraphics for real explorers\nLike all Novomatic games, it's completely fair and reliable, with a high return to player percentage of over 95%. You can collect regular wins as the reels spin from left to right across any payline, and even if the features may not be particularly innovative, there's a chance to claim some big wins in the free game.\n\nThe only step to take to undertake this adventure is to enter a safe and recommended casino that uses Novomatic software, make a deposit, and load the game. You can also try the free video slots of Marco Polo Deluxe, but the starting point for playing with real money is only 0.10 per spin. In common with many slot machines, the smaller but more frequent winning combinations are created by the playing card symbols 10, J, Q, K, and A. These are all colorful icons that have received a subtle Chinese style to help them fit into the overall theme.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nEach of these symbols must land on reels one, two, and three through a line to be worth anything, but the higher paying picture symbols must be seen on the first two reels only to pay a prize. The map pays up to 25x the stake, the treasure chest is worth up to 50x, and Kublai Khan - the emperor who hosted Marco Polo on his travels - pays up to 100x. The biggest prizes come from Marco Polo himself, who shares his wealth with you by paying a high limit of 500x the bet when he crosses a payline.\n\nMarco Polo is also a wild symbol. He can replace all symbols except camels, and if he can complete a combination for you or extend a win across multiple reels for a higher win.\n\nCamels are known to be moody creatures, but the delightful dromedary on these reels should brighten your day when it lands in three or more places in one spin. It's a scatter symbol that initially rewards you with ten free spins. Any win during these games is doubled in value, and with another camel as a second wild symbol, it's a bit easier to collect some prizes.\n\nIf the bonus round is triggered by three or more camel scatter symbols in view, all wins in the next ten games will be tripled in value. Trigger them again to quadruple your prizes, and so on. There is no maximum limit to how many times the free games can be triggered. But being realistic, you will be lucky to have more than 20 or 30 bonus games in total.\n\nWith a betting range that goes from 0.10 with all lines active up to a maximum of 100.00, most players will find an ideal level for them when spinning the reels of Marco Polo Deluxe. It's a simple command button that you just click until you reach the desired bet size, and there's a similar button to determine how many of the ten paylines you want to activate. If possible, you should always play all lines and adjust the bet amount based on your budget.\n\nThe Marco Polo Deluxe slot also features an Autoplay option. It's another very simple command feature that starts with a click and continues until you decide to stop the engine with another click.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you like the style of this game, then you should spin the five reels of The Voyages of Sinbad, a 1x2Gaming online casino slot that takes the exploration theme to new heights. It's full of mythical creatures, more free spins with doubled value wins, and an extra scatter symbol in play throughout the feature.\n\nBut if it's the gameplay that attracts you to Marco Polo Deluxe, then the Hat Trick slot, also from Novomatic, has virtually identical bonus spins, along with the five reels and ten paylines layout. It also has a magical theme that will appeal to many players.\n        ",
