Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame overview\nGame features\nHow to win\nGame design\nBet size and RTP\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Big Bucks Buffalo Gigablox\nThe Wilds of Arizona\nAlongside the eagle, the buffalo is perhaps the symbol that best represents the United States, celebrated in Native American culture as one of the most important totems. These mammoth animals live in herds and when they move, the earth shakes, just like in Big Bucks Buffalo Gigablox, the new slot game from Yggdrasil that we are sure has all the cards to become a great classic in the world of online gambling.\nAs soon as you open the initial screen, you find yourself facing the arid lands of Nevada, with low and dry bushes and the tall peaks that could be those of Death Valley.\nThe game grid is enclosed in a wooden frame and the predominant colors are light brown, yellow, and gold. The symbols are well designed, with excellent use of black and shadows to give a sense of three-dimensionality. We liked the fact that with each Spin, the Gigablox reels start to shake as if a buffalo herd were passing by.\nBefore starting the game, you are asked if you want to turn off the music, a western motif that makes the game's atmosphere more vivid.\n\nFeatures of Big Bucks Buffalo Gigablox\nThe first thing to do to play is to place a bet, which starts from a minimum of €0.40. With 40 fixed paylines, this means that each line costs only €0.01. The game grid has 6 reels and 4 rows, but the number of symbols is variable. In fact, with each Spin, the icons can land with Gigablox sizes, that is, 2x2 or 4x4 dimensions. It goes without saying that this translates into more possibilities to form paying combos.\nWith Autoplay, you can decide to set a number of automatic spins ranging from 10 to 1,000.\nThe theoretical return to player is not very high, being equal to 94%. However, we remind you that this data refers to a very large number of games played by a multitude of players and minimally affects the individual player's bets.\n\nHow to win at Big Bucks Buffalo Gigablox\nTo win, it is necessary to form combos of at least three symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards adjacent reels on the right. Depending on the size, Gigablox symbols are worth as much as 4 or 8 symbols.\nThe playing card suits (hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs) are the symbols worth the least, followed by the moose, wolf, bald eagle, and buffalo. The Wild replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by the gold token. When 6 of them land on the reels, 3 Respins are awarded during which the tokens take on a value between 1x and 1,000x. If the token is a Gigablox type, then the sum is doubled. In addition, each new token is locked on the reels and the Respins reset to 3.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAre automatic Spins available?\nYes, the Autoplay feature is present and allows you to set from 10 to 1,000 automatic spins.\n            ",

The game grid is enclosed in a wooden frame, and the predominant colors are light brown, yellow, and gold. The symbols are well-designed, with black and shadows used to create a sense of three-dimensionality. The game's atmosphere is enriched by a Western-style musical theme.\n\nGame Features\n\nTo start playing, players must place a bet that starts at €0.40. The game has 40 fixed paylines, and each line costs only €0.01. The game grid has 6 reels and 4 rows, with the number of symbols varying with each spin. The Gigablox feature means symbols can appear in 2x2 or 4x4 dimensions, increasing the possibility of forming winning combinations. Players can set Autoplay for 10 to 1,000 spins. The game has a theoretical return to player of 94%.\n\nGameplay\n\nPlayers must form combinations of at least three symbols, beginning from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards adjacent reels on the right. Depending on the size, Gigablox symbols are worth as much as 4 or 8 symbols. The playing card suits are the symbols worth the least, followed by the moose, wolf, bald eagle, and buffalo. The Wild symbol replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the gold token. When 6 Scatter symbols appear, players receive 3 Respins during which tokens take on a value of 1x to 1,000x. If the token is a Gigablox type, the sum is doubled. Additionally, each new token is locked on the reels and Respins reset to 3.\n\nWinning Combinations and Symbols\n\nWinning combinations require a minimum of three symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards adjacent reels on the right.

The game grid has 6 reels and 4 rows, with 40 fixed paylines and variable symbols that can land with Gigablox sizes, providing more possibilities to form paying combos.\n\nGame features\n\nPlayers can start by placing a bet, which starts from a minimum of €0.40 per spin. The Autoplay feature allows for automatic spins ranging from 10 to 1,000. The game features a Wild symbol that replaces all symbols except for the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by the gold token and when 6 of them land on the reels, players are awarded 3 Respins, with the tokens taking on a value between 1x and 1,000x. If the token is a Gigablox type, the sum is doubled and each new token is locked on the reels.\n\nHow to win\n\nIn order to win, players must form combos of at least three symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards adjacent reels on the right. Gigablox symbols are worth as much as 4 or 8 symbols. The lowest paying symbols are the playing card suits, followed by the moose, wolf, bald eagle, and buffalo. The Wild symbol can help players form winning combos, while the Scatter can trigger Respins with the possibility of winning up to 1,000x the bet.\n\nGame design\n\nThe game's design features a wooden frame enclosing the game grid, with light brown, yellow, and gold as the predominant colors. The symbols are well-designed with excellent use of black and shadows for three-dimensionality. With each Spin, the Gigablox reels start to shake as if a buffalo herd were passing by. The western motif music can be turned off before starting the game.\n\nBet size and RTP\n\nThe minimum bet per spin is €0.40, with 40 fixed paylines and variable symbols that can land with Gigablox sizes. The theoretical return to player is 94%, which is not very high but is determined by a large number of games played by many players and minimally affects individual player bets.\n\n        \n            ",

These mammoth animals live in herds and when they move, the earth shakes, just like in Big Bucks Buffalo Gigablox, the new slot game from Yggdrasil that we are sure has all the cards to become a great classic in the world of online gambling.\nAs soon as you open the initial screen, you find yourself facing the arid lands of Nevada, with low and dry bushes and the tall peaks that could be those of Death Valley.\nThe game grid is enclosed in a wooden frame and the predominant colors are light brown, yellow, and gold. The symbols are well designed, with excellent use of black and shadows to give a sense of three-dimensionality. We liked the fact that with each Spin, the Gigablox reels start to shake as if a buffalo herd were passing by.\nBefore starting the game, you are asked if you want to turn off the music, a western motif that makes the game's atmosphere more vivid.\n\nFeatures of Big Bucks Buffalo Gigablox\nThe first thing to do to play is to place a bet, which starts from a minimum of €0.40. With 40 fixed paylines, this means that each line costs only €0.01. The game grid has 6 reels and 4 rows, but the number of symbols is variable. In fact, with each Spin, the icons can land with Gigablox sizes, that is, 2x2 or 4x4 dimensions. It goes without saying that this translates into more possibilities to form paying combos.\nWith Autoplay, you can decide to set a number of automatic spins ranging from 10 to 1,000.\nThe theoretical return to player is not very high, being equal to 94%. However, we remind you that this data refers to a very large number of games played by a multitude of players and minimally affects the individual player's bets.\n\nHow to win at Big Bucks Buffalo Gigablox\nTo win, it is necessary to form combos of at least three symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards adjacent reels on the right. Depending on the size, Gigablox symbols are worth as much as 4 or 8 symbols.\nThe playing card suits (hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs) are the symbols worth the least, followed by the moose, wolf, bald eagle, and buffalo. The Wild replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by the gold token. When 6 of them land on the reels, 3 Respins are awarded during which the tokens take on a value between 1x and 1,000x. If the token is a Gigablox type, then the sum is doubled. In addition, each new token is locked on the reels and the Respins reset to 3.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAre automatic Spins available?\nYes, the Autoplay feature is present and allows you to set from 10 to 1,000 automatic spins.\n            ",
