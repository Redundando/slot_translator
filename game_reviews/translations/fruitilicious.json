A feast of succulent fruits, an easy gameplay without special features or bonuses, Fruitilicious is perfect whether you're a veteran or stepping into this world for the first time!\n\nAlthough the theme is the ultimate classic, with this slot machine produced by Novomatic, you won't find a game that rests on its vintage laurels and neglects design! In fact, the slot's appearance is bold and bright, with a contrasting combination of green and purple colors. The symbols that alternate on the reels, despite being typical of the Fruit Machine tradition, are reproduced in a very detailed way and look truly inviting and delicious.\n\nEverything in this slot machine is presented in such a way as to give the game an overall fresh and bright look, which is a big step forward compared to many Fruit Machines that have a rather monotonous and even a bit sad appearance. Fruitilicious features very simple and relaxing sound effects, so you don't need to mute the audio while spinning the reels as you will be pleasantly accompanied by a non-intrusive background.\n\nKey features of the slot machine\nFruitilicious is a very simple and intuitive slot in terms of gameplay structure: it has five reels and three rows, while the paylines are only five. Despite the structure being so simple, it is a game with medium-high volatility, which means that you will have to be patient before obtaining winnings, but your patience could be rewarded with potentially very profitable prizes.\n\nThe betting amounts can be modified according to your gameplay strategies: if you are occasional players, you can bet a minimum of ten credits per line, while if you are high rollers, your bet can go up to 2,000 credits per line. The five betting lines are fixed, meaning that the overall betting range goes from 50 to 10,000 credits.\n\nThe theoretical return to player or RTP, with a not quite satisfying 95%, is a little below average.\n\nSymbols and features of Fruitilicious\nRegarding any special features, as we have already said, you won't find any on Fruitilicious, but you'll have to settle for a really stripped-down gameplay! Among the symbols, we have the classic ones of the Fruit Machine, which include lemons, cherries, plums, and oranges, with payouts up to 25 times the value of the bet, grapes, and watermelons that reward up to 100 times for alignments of five symbols, and the number 7, which among all the symbols is the most profitable of all, with a prize of up to 1,000 times your bet.\n\nThere are no Wild or Scatter symbols, but you can learn the value of each icon in the various combinations by simply consulting the paytable.",

The symbols that alternate on the reels, while typical of the Fruit Machine tradition, are reproduced in a very well cared for manner and look really inviting and delicious.\n\nEverything in this slot machine is presented in such a way as to give the game an overall fresh and bright look, which is a step forward compared to many Fruit Machines that have a rather monotonous and even a little sad look.\n\nFruitilicious has very simple and relaxing sound effects, so you won't need to mute the audio while spinning the reels, as you will be pleasantly accompanied in the gaming experience by a non-invasive background.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nFruitilicious is a very simple and intuitive slot from the point of view of the game structure: it has five reels and three rows, while the paylines are only five. Despite such a simple structure, it is a game with medium-high volatility, which means that you will have to be patient before getting any winnings, but that your patience could be rewarded with potentially very lucrative prizes.\n\nThe amounts of the bets can be modified depending on your gaming strategies: if you are occasional players you can bet a minimum of ten credits per line, while if you are high rollers your bet can go up to 2,000 credits per line. The five betting lines are fixed, which means that the range of total bets ranges from 50 to 10,000 credits.\n\nThe theoretical return to player or RTP, with a rather unsatisfactory 95%, is somewhat below average.\n\nSymbols and functionality of Fruitilicious\nAs far as any special features are concerned, as we have already said, you will not find them on Fruitilicious, but you will have to settle for a really stripped-down gameplay!\n\nAmong the symbols we have the classic ones of the Fruit Machine, which include lemons, cherries, plums and oranges, with payouts up to 25 times the value of the bet, grapes and watermelons that reward up to 100 times for alignments of five symbols and the number 7 which, among all the symbols, is the most profitable of all, with a prize of up to 1,000 times your bet.\n\nThere are no Wild or Scatter symbols, but you can learn the value of each icon in the various combinations simply by consulting the paytable.\n            ",

It has five reels, three rows, and 5 paylines. The game has a medium-high volatility, which means getting winnings may take some patience, but it offers potentially lucrative prizes.\n\nBet Range\n\nThe game offers a wide range of bets, from a minimum of ten credits per line for occasional players to a maximum of 2,000 credits per line for high rollers. The fixed paylines mean the range of total bets is between 50 and 10,000 credits.\n\nPayouts\n\nFruitilicious has classic fruit machine symbols, including lemons, cherries, plums, oranges, grapes, watermelons, and the number 7. Payouts range up to 25 times the value of the bet for lemons, cherries, plums, and oranges, up to 100 times for grapes and watermelons, and up to 1,000 times for the number 7. There are no Wild or Scatter symbols.\n\nGame Design\n\nFruitilicious offers a fresh and bright look compared to other fruit machines. The combination of green and purple colors on the reels creates a bold and inviting design. The symbols are traditionally styled but reproduced in an attractive and appetizing manner. The game has simple and relaxing sound effects that don't distract from the gameplay.\n\nRTP\n\nThe theoretical return to player or RTP of Fruitilicious is 95%, which is lower than average.\n\n        \n            ",

In fact, the look of the slot is bold and bright, with a combination of green and purple colors placed in contrast. The symbols that alternate on the reels, while typical of the Fruit Machine tradition, are reproduced in a very well cared for manner and look really inviting and delicious.\n\nEverything in this slot machine is presented in such a way as to give the game an overall fresh and bright look, which is a step forward compared to many Fruit Machines that have a rather monotonous and even a little sad look.\n\nFruitilicious has very simple and relaxing sound effects, so you won't need to mute the audio while spinning the reels, as you will be pleasantly accompanied in the gaming experience by a non-invasive background.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\nFruitilicious is a very simple and intuitive slot from the point of view of the game structure: it has five reels and three rows, while the paylines are only five. Despite such a simple structure, it is a game with medium-high volatility, which means that you will have to be patient before getting any winnings, but that your patience could be rewarded with potentially very lucrative prizes.\n\nThe amounts of the bets can be modified depending on your gaming strategies: if you are occasional players you can bet a minimum of ten credits per line, while if you are high rollers your bet can go up to 2,000 credits per line. The five betting lines are fixed, which means that the range of total bets ranges from 50 to 10,000 credits.\n\nThe theoretical return to player or RTP, with a rather unsatisfactory 95%, is somewhat below average.\n\nSymbols and functionality of Fruitilicious\nAs far as any special features are concerned, as we have already said, you will not find them on Fruitilicious, but you will have to settle for a really stripped-down gameplay!\n\nAmong the symbols we have the classic ones of the Fruit Machine, which include lemons, cherries, plums and oranges, with payouts up to 25 times the value of the bet, grapes and watermelons that reward up to 100 times for alignments of five symbols and the number 7 which, among all the symbols, is the most profitable of all, with a prize of up to 1,000 times your bet.\n\nThere are no Wild or Scatter symbols, but you can learn the value of each icon in the various combinations simply by consulting the paytable.\n        ",
