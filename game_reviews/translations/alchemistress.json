Alla destra dei rulli si trova invece un libro di incantesimi la cui funzione verrà spiegata più avanti.\nCosa aspettarci da Alchemistress\nLa High 5 Games ha deciso di puntare su una griglia classica 5×3 con 20 linee di pagamento fisse. La puntata minima fissata a 20 crediti, con ogni credito che costa 0,01 €. I pulsanti per le giocate sono sistemati sulla destra: oltre al tasto Start, troviamo l’Autoplay e il Turbo, utile per velocizzare le giocate.\nIl ritorno teorico del giocatore è buono, essendo al 96%. La volatilità è media, con un ottimo bilanciamento tra Spin effettuati e somme vinte.\nBonus e moltiplicatori per vincite di livello\nIn Alchemistress abbiamo solo simboli tematici legati tra loro. Il fiore arancione, le bacche viola e il ramo verde, poi ci sono tre ampolle anch’esse arancione, viola e verde e tre maghetti, con gli stessi identici colori sullo sfondo. Ad ogni combinazione pagante, le ampolle sulla griglia, che fungono da contatore, si riempiono. Una volta riempite tutte, il moltiplicatore aumenterà di 1x, generando vincite molto sostanziose.\nC’è poi il simbolo Jackpot, che è quello che paga più di tutti.\nL’anello è il simbolo Wild, può comparire soltanto sul rulli 2, 3 e 4, e sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter. Il libro chiuso è invece un simbolo bonus. Quando compare sui rulli, aumenterà il moltiplicatore che si trova sul libro di incantesimo alla destra della griglia. Tale moltiplicatore verrà applicato durante i Free Spins.\nIl libro aperto è il nostro Scatter e assegna da 7 a 20 Free Spins.\nI giri gratuiti si giocano su una griglia diversa da quella del gioco base e con simboli leggermente differenti. Il moltiplicatore di partenza è 2x ma il meccanismo è lo stesso del gioco principale: anche qui le combo vincenti fanno aumentare il moltiplicatore di x1.\n\nFAQ: Le risposte alle domande più frequenti \nHo letto che la volatilità è media. È una cosa buona?\n\nDipende dai gusti del giocatore. Per volatilità si intende il rapporto tra frequenza di vincite e somme elargite. Se la volatilità ècac media, si ottengono vincite né troppo alte né troppo basse e abbastanza frequenti.\n\n\n\nCi sono i giri automatici?\n\nSì, e si giocano con la stessa puntata scelta per gli Spin manuali. Volendo, si possono impostare limiti di vincita e di perdita superati i quali il gioco automatico si ferma.\n\n\n\nPosso giocare anche sullo Smartphone?\n\nCerto, Alchemistress è fruibile da tablet, cellulare e pc.\n\n\n\n",

The volatility is medium, with an excellent balance between spins and winnings.\n\nBonuses and Multipliers for level Wins\n\nIn Alchemistress, we only have thematic symbols related to each other.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and Mechanics\n\nAlchemistress has a classic 5x3 grid with 20 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is set at 20 credits, with each credit costing €0.01. Players can use the Start, Autoplay, and Turbo buttons located on the right of the game to initiate their spins. The theoretical return is good at 96%. The volatility is medium, with an excellent balance between spins and winnings.\n\nThematic Symbols and Design\n\nThe game has a Harry-Potter inspired design featuring potions, spells, and three young wizard apprentices with wands. The theme is consistent throughout the game with only thematic symbols present on the reels. The vials on the board fill up with each paying combination, and once all are full, the multiplier increases by 1x, generating substantial winnings. The game board is located in a candlelit room overlooking a dark forest, adding to the game's mysterious atmosphere.\n\nBonus Features and Free Spins\n\nAlchemistress features both a Wild and a Scatter symbol. The Wild symbol is the ring and only appears on reels 2, 3, and 4, replacing all symbols except the Scatter. The bonus symbol is a closed book, and once it appears on the reels, it increases the multiplier found in the spell book to the right of the board. That multiplier will be applied during Free Spins. The Scatter symbol is an open book and awards from 7 to 20 Free Spins. During Free Spins, players can see an increase in their winnings as the starting multiplier is 2x, but the mechanism is the same as the base game: winning combos increase the multiplier by x1.\n\nVolatility and Player Preferences\n\nThe game has medium volatility, which means that players can expect neither too high nor too low winnings quite frequently. If this volatility matches their taste, they will likely enjoy this game. The theoretical return of 96% is good, and the balance between spins and winnings is excellent.\n\nAccessibility on Desktop and Mobile Devices\n\nPlayers can access Alchemistress on tablets, mobile phones, and PCs. High 5 Games has optimized the game for mobile devices to ensure that players can enjoy the same experience on their smartphones as they would on their desktops. The game is suitable for players who prefer to play on-the-go, have a preference for playing on their desktop, or prefer playing on a tablet device.\n\n        \n            ",

Rowling's pen that has conquered generations of youth and adults around the world.\n\nAs in Harry Potter, potions, spells, and three young wizard apprentices with wands are present here as well. In the candlelit room, a young witch surveils the game board, at the top of which are various vials that function as special counters that accumulate multipliers. To the right of the reels is a spell book whose purpose will be explained later.\n\nWhat To Expect from Alchemistress\n\nHigh 5 Games has decided to focus on classic 5x3 grid with 20 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is set at 20 credits, with each credit costing €0.01. The play buttons are on the right: in addition to the Start button, we find Autoplay and Turbo, which is useful for speeding up plays.\n\nThe player's theoretical return is good at 96%. The volatility is medium, with an excellent balance between spins and winnings.\n\nBonuses and Multipliers for level Wins\n\nIn Alchemistress, we only have thematic symbols related to each other. The orange flower, purple berries, and green branch, then three vials also in orange, purple, and green, and three wizards, with the same identical colors in the background. With each paying combination, the vials on the board, which function as counters, fill up. Once all are full, the multiplier increases by 1x, generating very substantial winnings.\n\nThere is also the Jackpot symbol, which pays more than any other.\n\nThe ring is the Wild symbol, and it can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, replacing all symbols except the Scatter. The closed book is a bonus symbol. When it appears on the reels, it increases the multiplier found in the spell book to the right of the board. That multiplier will be applied during Free Spins. \n\nThe open book is our Scatter and awards from 7 to 20 Free Spins.\n\nFree spins are played on a different board than the base game and feature slightly different symbols. The starting multiplier is 2x, but the mechanism is the same as the base game: winning combos increase the multiplier by x1. \n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequent questions \n\nI read that volatility is medium. Is this a good thing?\n\nIt depends on the player's tastes. Volatility refers to the ratio between the frequency of wins and the amounts awarded. If the volatility is medium, one obtains neither too high nor too low winnings and quite frequently.\n\nAre there automatic spins?\n\nYes, and they are played with the same bet chosen for manual spins. If desired, win and loss limits can be set, which, once reached, will stop the automatic game.\n\nCan I also play on my smartphone?\n\nCertainly, Alchemistress is available for tablets, mobile phones, and PCs.\n            ",

Rowling's pen that has conquered generations of youth and adults around the world.\n\nAs in Harry Potter, potions, spells, and three young wizard apprentices with wands are present here as well. In the candlelit room, a young witch surveils the game board, at the top of which are various vials that function as special counters that accumulate multipliers. To the right of the reels is a spell book whose purpose will be explained later.\n\nWhat To Expect from Alchemistress\n\nHigh 5 Games has decided to focus on classic 5x3 grid with 20 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is set at 20 credits, with each credit costing €0.01. The play buttons are on the right: in addition to the Start button, we find Autoplay and Turbo, which is useful for speeding up plays.\n\nThe player's theoretical return is good at 96%. The volatility is medium, with an excellent balance between spins and winnings.\n\nBonuses and Multipliers for level Wins\n\nIn Alchemistress, we only have thematic symbols related to each other. The orange flower, purple berries, and green branch, then three vials also in orange, purple, and green, and three wizards, with the same identical colors in the background. With each paying combination, the vials on the board, which function as counters, fill up. Once all are full, the multiplier increases by 1x, generating very substantial winnings.\n\nThere is also the Jackpot symbol, which pays more than any other.\n\nThe ring is the Wild symbol, and it can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, replacing all symbols except the Scatter. The closed book is a bonus symbol. When it appears on the reels, it increases the multiplier found in the spell book to the right of the board. That multiplier will be applied during Free Spins. \n\nThe open book is our Scatter and awards from 7 to 20 Free Spins.\n\nFree spins are played on a different board than the base game and feature slightly different symbols. The starting multiplier is 2x, but the mechanism is the same as the base game: winning combos increase the multiplier by x1. \n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequent questions \n\nI read that volatility is medium. Is this a good thing?\n\nIt depends on the player's tastes. Volatility refers to the ratio between the frequency of wins and the amounts awarded. If the volatility is medium, one obtains neither too high nor too low winnings and quite frequently.\n\nAre there automatic spins?\n\nYes, and they are played with the same bet chosen for manual spins. If desired, win and loss limits can be set, which, once reached, will stop the automatic game.\n\nCan I also play on my smartphone?\n\nCertainly, Alchemistress is available for tablets, mobile phones, and PCs.\n            ",
