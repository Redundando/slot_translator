Monopoly Big Event esaudisce i vostri sogni con un gioco dalle altissime potenzialità ma certamente non adatto a coloro che non amano rischiare.\nIl tema, ovviamente, è quello del gioco di società, sviluppato in maniera davvero fedele e coerente, anche per quanto riguarda il compartimento grafico che si rifà del tutto al gioco della Hasbro.\nLa schermata iniziale si apre infatti con il volto del noto omino dai baffi bianchi del Monopoly (Mr Monopoly o zio Pennybags), mentre la schermata di gioco è accolta in uno sfondo di colore rosso scuro molto lineare e senza fronzoli, con i simboli che girano sui rulli in contrasto di colore verde.\nI tasti per il settaggio del gioco in Monopoly Big Event non si trovano in basso, al contrario della maggior parte delle slot machine, ma sono posizionati ai lati dei rulli: grazie ad essi si potrà impostare il valore della puntata, dare il via ai giri o giocare in modalità automatica grazie al tasto Autospin.\nStruttura di gioco, intervallo di scommesse, volatilità e RTP\nPer quanto riguarda la struttura di gioco, Monopoly Big Event è una slot machine abbastanza semplice: ha infatti cinque rulli e venti linee di pagamento e, sebbene preveda alcune funzionalità speciali, non si può dire che abbia un gameplay particolarmente articolato.\nCiò che rende particolare il gioco, e dunque interessante da giocare, è l’entità delle cifre che possono essere scommesse: il valore minimo del gettone è un canonico 1 centesimo, che moltiplicato per le venti linee determina una scommessa minima di soli 20 centesimi. Quando però andiamo a vedere il valore massimo del gettone ci troviamo davanti a uno sbalorditivo 25 €, che determina una puntata massima per giro di ben 500 €! Una slot machine con questo intervallo di scommesse non poteva non essere caratterizzata da un’alta volatilità, che promette premi di un certo valore!\nL’RTP di Monopoly Big Event si attesta invece su un soddisfacente 96 %.\nSimboli di Monopoly Big Event\nI due simboli più apprezzati in Monopoly Big Event sono lo zio Pennybags Wild e Rich (la leggendaria mascotte del gioco), che pagano 2000 volte la scommessa se compaiono su tutti i cinque rulli. Oltre a questi abbiamo il cane, il gatto, una macchina e una nave, oltre che i cosiddetti simboli reali (le carte dal 10 all’Asso).\nIl Wild è il logo della slot, mentre lo zio Pennybags dietro le sbarre rappresenta il simbolo.\nSono presenti diverse funzionalità speciali, tra le quali spicca la “Big Event” che permette di portare a casa delle vincite molto interessanti.\nPronti via, dunque, si va dritti verso i grandi premi senza dover passare mai per la prigione!\n",

And who hasn't dreamed, while playing Monopoly, that those colorful fake banknotes could magically turn into real money? Monopoly Big Event fulfills your dreams with a game of high potential but certainly not suitable for those who don't like to take risks. \nThe theme, of course, is that of the board game, developed in a truly faithful and consistent way, including for the graphic compartment that completely refers to the Hasbro game. The initial screen opens with the face of the well-known white-mustached Monopoly man (Mr. Monopoly or Uncle Pennybags), while the game screen is welcomed in a very linear and unfussy dark red background, with symbols spinning on the reels in contrasting green color. \nThe game settings buttons in Monopoly Big Event are not located at the bottom, unlike most slot machines, but are positioned on the sides of the reels: with them you can set the value of the bet, start the spins or play in automatic mode thanks to the Autospin button.\n\nGameplay structure, betting range, volatility and RTP\nAs for the game structure, Monopoly Big Event is a fairly simple slot machine: it has five reels and twenty paylines and, although it provides some special features, it cannot be said to have a particularly elaborate gameplay. What makes the game special, and therefore interesting to play, is the amount of money that can be bet: the minimum value of the token is a classic 1 cent, which multiplied by the twenty lines determines a minimum bet of only 20 cents. When we look instead at the maximum value of the token we find ourselves faced with a stunning €25, which determines a maximum bet per spin of €500! A slot machine with this betting range could not help but be characterized by high volatility, promising prizes of certain value!\nThe RTP of Monopoly Big Event is instead a satisfactory 96%.\n\nSymbols of Monopoly Big Event\nThe two most appreciated symbols in Monopoly Big Event are the Uncle Pennybags Wild and Rich (the legendary game mascot), which pay 2000 times the bet if they appear on all five reels. In addition to these, we have the dog, cat, car and ship symbols, as well as the so-called royal symbols (cards from 10 to Ace). \nThe Wild is the slot logo, while Uncle Pennybags behind bars represents the symbol.

And who hasn't dreamed, while playing Monopoly, that those colorful fake banknotes could magically turn into real money? Monopoly Big Event fulfills your dreams with a game of high potential but certainly not suitable for those who don't like to take risks. \nThe theme, of course, is that of the board game, developed in a truly faithful and consistent way, including for the graphic compartment that completely refers to the Hasbro game. The initial screen opens with the face of the well-known white-mustached Monopoly man (Mr. Monopoly or Uncle Pennybags), while the game screen is welcomed in a very linear and unfussy dark red background, with symbols spinning on the reels in contrasting green color. \nThe game settings buttons in Monopoly Big Event are not located at the bottom, unlike most slot machines, but are positioned on the sides of the reels: with them you can set the value of the bet, start the spins or play in automatic mode thanks to the Autospin button.\n\nGameplay structure, betting range, volatility and RTP\nAs for the game structure, Monopoly Big Event is a fairly simple slot machine: it has five reels and twenty paylines and, although it provides some special features, it cannot be said to have a particularly elaborate gameplay. What makes the game special, and therefore interesting to play, is the amount of money that can be bet: the minimum value of the token is a classic 1 cent, which multiplied by the twenty lines determines a minimum bet of only 20 cents. When we look instead at the maximum value of the token we find ourselves faced with a stunning €25, which determines a maximum bet per spin of €500! A slot machine with this betting range could not help but be characterized by high volatility, promising prizes of certain value!\nThe RTP of Monopoly Big Event is instead a satisfactory 96%.\n\nSymbols of Monopoly Big Event\nThe two most appreciated symbols in Monopoly Big Event are the Uncle Pennybags Wild and Rich (the legendary game mascot), which pay 2000 times the bet if they appear on all five reels. In addition to these, we have the dog, cat, car and ship symbols, as well as the so-called royal symbols (cards from 10 to Ace). \nThe Wild is the slot logo, while Uncle Pennybags behind bars represents the symbol. There are several special features, among which stands out the \"Big Event\" which allows you to take home very interesting winnings. Ready, set, go straight to the big prizes without ever having to go through jail!\n            ",

It has faithful and consistent graphic representations of the board game, including the white-mustached Monopoly man (Mr. Monopoly or Uncle Pennybags) and symbols that spin on the reels in contrasting green color.\n\nGame Structure and Betting Range\n\nMonopoly Big Event has a simple game structure, with five reels and twenty paylines. It provides some special features that make the game interesting to play, and the amount of money that can be bet is its main attraction. The minimum value of the token is 1 cent, which multiplied by the twenty lines determines a minimum bet of only 20 cents. The maximum value of the token, however, is €25, which determines a maximum bet per spin of €500.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nMonopoly Big Event has a satisfactory RTP of 96%. With its high betting range, the game is characterized by high volatility, promising prizes of certain value.\n\nSymbols and Special Features\n\nThe symbols of Monopoly Big Event include the Uncle Pennybags Wild and Rich, which pay 2000 times the bet if they appear on all five reels. Other symbols include the dog, cat, car, ship and royal symbols (cards from 10 to Ace). The Wild is the slot logo, while Uncle Pennybags behind bars represents the symbol. There are several special features, among which stands out the 'Big Event' which allows you to take home very interesting winnings. Players can also play in automatic mode thanks to the Autospin button.\n\nPrizes and Winnings\n\nMonopoly Big Event offers prizes and winnings that are worth the high betting risk. The standout feature is the 'Big Event' which allows players to win big prizes without having to go through jail. With its high volatility, Monopoly Big Event promises prizes that are worth pursuing, especially for those with a passion for the classic board game.\n\n        \n            ",

And who hasn't dreamed, while playing Monopoly, that those colorful fake banknotes could magically turn into real money? Monopoly Big Event fulfills your dreams with a game of high potential but certainly not suitable for those who don't like to take risks. \nThe theme, of course, is that of the board game, developed in a truly faithful and consistent way, including for the graphic compartment that completely refers to the Hasbro game. The initial screen opens with the face of the well-known white-mustached Monopoly man (Mr. Monopoly or Uncle Pennybags), while the game screen is welcomed in a very linear and unfussy dark red background, with symbols spinning on the reels in contrasting green color. \nThe game settings buttons in Monopoly Big Event are not located at the bottom, unlike most slot machines, but are positioned on the sides of the reels: with them you can set the value of the bet, start the spins or play in automatic mode thanks to the Autospin button.\n\nGameplay structure, betting range, volatility and RTP\nAs for the game structure, Monopoly Big Event is a fairly simple slot machine: it has five reels and twenty paylines and, although it provides some special features, it cannot be said to have a particularly elaborate gameplay. What makes the game special, and therefore interesting to play, is the amount of money that can be bet: the minimum value of the token is a classic 1 cent, which multiplied by the twenty lines determines a minimum bet of only 20 cents. When we look instead at the maximum value of the token we find ourselves faced with a stunning €25, which determines a maximum bet per spin of €500! A slot machine with this betting range could not help but be characterized by high volatility, promising prizes of certain value!\nThe RTP of Monopoly Big Event is instead a satisfactory 96%.\n\nSymbols of Monopoly Big Event\nThe two most appreciated symbols in Monopoly Big Event are the Uncle Pennybags Wild and Rich (the legendary game mascot), which pay 2000 times the bet if they appear on all five reels. In addition to these, we have the dog, cat, car and ship symbols, as well as the so-called royal symbols (cards from 10 to Ace). \nThe Wild is the slot logo, while Uncle Pennybags behind bars represents the symbol. There are several special features, among which stands out the \"Big Event\" which allows you to take home very interesting winnings. Ready, set, go straight to the big prizes without ever having to go through jail!\n            ",
