La grafica non è nulla di rivoluzionario, ma ci siamo certamente divertiti a giocare, soprattutto quando si sono scatenati i preziosi giri bonus.\nLe bobine con i simboli moltiplicatori wild possono portare alcuni grandi premi, e le caratteristiche in gioco sono quasi sicuramente in grado di creare una o due combo vincenti. Se state pensando di prendere l’opzione della scommessa bonus, vale la pena sapere che l’RTP durante la Genie Parade sale al 96,36%.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nAnche la slot Aladdin and the Sorcerer di Pragmatic Play è un gioco a cinque rulli e 20 linee.

Will Aladdin realize his jackpot wishes? Find out in our in-depth review of Golden Genie.\n\nGenies are famous for granting the wishes of those lucky enough to find the magic lamps they call home. With the Golden Genie slot machine, anyone looking for multiplier wild symbols, stacked wilds, and wandering icons will have all three wishes come true.\n\nThis is a five-reel, 20-line game featuring the handsome Aladdin, the beautiful Jasmine, and the powerful Genie. The Golden Genie online slot works on both desktop and mobile and brings a touch of magic to casinos with the Nolimit City range.\n\nA genie-like design\n\nThis is not the first game based on the story of an orphaned boy and his magical lamp, and we're sure it won't be the last. The grid of symbols with a golden frame is located on a starry sky background, and the vertical orientation of each symbol helps the game fit on smartphone and tablet screens.\n\nWhether the use of playing card icons is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but they do little to add to the magical theme of the Golden Genie slot machine. A cobra and a leopard are medium-level prizes, and although the leopard doesn't fit the story, the game looks good, so we won't complain.\n\nThe three main characters, each presented in a detailed but cartoonish style, offer the highest prizes. It's part of a relatively small but very popular range from Swedish developer Nolimit City.\n\nThe design is simple but classy in the Golden Genie slot. Based on the classic folk tale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. With a starry night sky in the background, the graphics are colorful and high definition. The bold images have a TV cartoon look. They are well-made.\n\nOn the reels, you'll see real A to 10 next to a leopard, panther, lamp, Aladdin, and a woman. This mysterious woman is the top standard symbol, awarding 1, 3.75, or 25 times your total bet if you land 3, 4 or 5 on a payline.\n\nThe genie is the wild and scatter symbol. It replaces all symbols to create winning combinations. The genie symbol also grants up to 25x your total stake per payline.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nNo need to rub a lamp to unlock the magic. Just spin the reels and watch out for the Genie. It's a wild symbol, behaving like others to complete a winning sequence, and it's also the trigger for a special Genie Parade feature.\n\nYou need at least three Genie symbols in sight, or you can cheat a little and trigger the feature with a bonus bet of 80 times your bet. It sounds like a lot, but so are the potential winnings of this Golden Genie online slot feature.\n\nAll Genies lock in place, and one of the triggering symbols becomes a Golden Genie. The rest of the reels take a breath as all Genies move one reel to the left. This continues with the Golden Genie increasing a multiplier with each respin. If it goes off-screen and other triggering symbols are still on the reels, the accumulated multiplier is transferred to the nearest Genie.\n\nWith a bit of luck, the Genie Parade runs and runs as others appear in respins and multipliers continue to rise.\n\nIt's not the only bonus in the Golden Genie slot machine. The Genie Lamps feature, randomly awarded, sees two and four reels fill with stacked wild lamps. Each new winning combination is calculated, and the game pays from both the left and right sides.\n\nThe Genie Wishes feature is triggered if Aladdin lands on the immediate left of the lamp on any spin. All examples of both symbols become extra wilds and multiply wins by 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, or 10x.\n\nIf you like magical themed slots and enchanting bonuses, you'll love the Golden Genie online slot. The graphics are nothing revolutionary, but we certainly had fun playing it, especially when the precious bonus spins were triggered.\n\nReels with multiplier wild symbols can bring in some big prizes, and the in-game features are almost certainly capable of creating one or two winning combos. If you're thinking of taking the bonus bet option, it's worth knowing that the RTP during the Genie Parade rises to 96.36%.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nPragmatic Play's Aladdin and the Sorcerer slot is also a five-reel, 20-line game.

Ogni nuova combinazione vincente viene calcolata, e il gioco paga sia dal lato sinistro che destro.\nLa funzione Genie Wishes si attiva se Aladdin atterra nell’immediata sinistra della lampada in qualsiasi rotazione. Tutti gli esempi di entrambi i simboli diventano extra wild e moltiplicano le vincite per 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, o 10x.\nSe vi piacciono le slot a tema magico e i bonus incantevoli, allora amerete la slot online Golden Genie. La grafica non è nulla di rivoluzionario, ma ci siamo certamente divertiti a giocare, soprattutto quando si sono scatenati i preziosi giri bonus.\nLe bobine con i simboli moltiplicatori wild possono portare alcuni grandi premi, e le caratteristiche in gioco sono quasi sicuramente in grado di creare una o due combo vincenti. Se state pensando di prendere l’opzione della scommessa bonus, vale la pena sapere che l’RTP durante la Genie Parade sale al 96,36%.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nAnche la slot Aladdin and the Sorcerer di Pragmatic Play è un gioco a cinque rulli e 20 linee. È caratterizzato da simboli wild di tipo Stacked e respingi bobina, dove i due personaggi principali si attaccano l’un l’altro. Se Aladdin vince, altri premi nel round vengono triplicati.\nGenie Wild, invece, è una slot di NextGen Gaming con grafica da cartone animato. Il Genio femminile è un simbolo wild, e durante un round di giochi gratuiti, si espande attraverso i rulli per aiutarti a vincere premi extra.\n\n        ",

These include symbols that transform into wilds and provide a multiplier boost, stacked wilds with both ways pays, and a bonus game where each walking wild symbol increases a 1x multiplier. Can Aladdin make His jackpot wishes come true? Find out in our detailed review of Golden Genie.\nThe Genie is famous for granting the wishes of those lucky enough to find the magic lamps they call home. With the Golden Genie slot machine, anyone looking for multiplying wild symbols, stacked wild symbols, and wandering icons will have all three wishes granted.\nIt's a five-reel, 20-line game featuring handsome Aladdin, beautiful Jasmine, and powerful Genie. The online Golden Genie slot works on desktop and mobile and brings a touch of magic to casinos with the Nolimit City range.\nGenie-themed graphics\nThis isn't the first game based on the story of an orphan boy and his magic lamp, and we're sure it won't be the last. The golden-framed symbol grid sits against a starry sky background, and the vertical orientation of each symbol helps the game adapt to smartphone and tablet screens.\nWhether using playing card icons on a slot game is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but they do little to add to the magical theme of the Golden Genie slot machine. A cobra and a leopard are mid-level prizes, and although the leopard doesn't fit the story, the game looks good, so we won't complain.\nThe three main characters, each presented in a detailed but cartoonish style, offer the highest prizes. It's part of a relatively small but popular range from Swedish developer Nolimit City.\nThe design is simple but classy in the Golden Genie slot. Based on the classic folk tale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. With a starry night sky background, the graphics are colorful and sharp. The bold images have a TV cartoon look about them. They're well done.\nOn the reels, you'll see A to 10 royals alongside a leopard, a panther, a lamp, Aladdin, and a woman. This mysterious woman is the top standard symbol, awarding 1, 3.75, or 25 times your total bet if you land 3, 4, or 5 on a payline.\nThe Genie is the wild and scatter. It therefore replaces all symbols to create winning combinations. The genie symbol also grants up to 25x your total bet per payline.\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThere's no need to rub a lamp to unlock the magic. Just spin the reels and watch out for the Genie. It's a wild symbol, behaving like others to complete a winning sequence, and it's also the trigger element of a special Genie Parade feature.\nYou need at least three Genie symbols in view, or you can cheat a little and launch the feature with a bonus bet of 80 times your bet. It sounds like a lot, but so are the potential wins from this Golden Genie online slot feature.\nAll Genies lock in position, and one of the triggering symbols becomes a Gold Genie. The rest of the reels respin as all Genies move one reel to the left. This continues, with the Golden Genie increasing a multiplier on each respin. If it goes off-screen and other triggering symbols are still on the reels, the accumulated multiplier transfers to the nearest Genie.\nWith a bit of luck, the Genie Parade runs and runs, with others appearing in respins and multipliers continuing to rise.\nIt's not the only bonus in the Golden Genie slot machine. The Genie Lamps feature, randomly awarded, sees two and four reels filling with stacked wild lamps. Each new winning combination is calculated, and the game pays both left and right.\nThe Genie Wishes feature is triggered if Aladdin lands immediately to the left of the lamp in any spin. All instances of both symbols become extra wilds and multiply wins by 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, or 10x.\nIf you like magical themed slots and enchanting bonuses, then you'll love the Golden Genie online slot. The graphics aren't revolutionary, but we certainly had fun playing, especially when the precious bonus spins were triggered.\nReels with multiplying wild symbols can bring some big prizes, and the in-game features are almost certainly capable of creating one or two winning combos. If you're thinking of taking the bonus bet option, it's worth knowing that the RTP during the Genie Parade rises to 96.36%.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nPragmatic Play's Aladdin and the Sorcerer slot is also a 5-reel, 20-line game. It features stacked wild symbols and reel respins, where the two main characters attack each other. If Aladdin wins, other prizes in the round are tripled.\nGenie Wild, on the other hand, is a NextGen Gaming slot with cartoon graphics. The female Genie is a wild symbol, and during a free games round, she expands across the reels to help you win extra prizes."

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay Features\nWild and Scatter Symbol\nGenie Parade Feature\nGenie Lamps Feature\nGenie Wishes Feature\nDesign and Graphics\nStoryline and Theme\nPayouts and Winnings\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Golden Genie\n\nCreated by Nolimit City, Golden Genie is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot with 3 functions. These include symbols that transform into wilds and provide a multiplier boost, stacked wilds with wins paying both ways, and a bonus game where each walking wild symbol that appears increases a 1x multiplier. Will Aladdin realize his jackpot wishes? Find out in our in-depth review of Golden Genie.\n\nGenies are famous for granting the wishes of those lucky enough to find the magic lamps they call home. With the Golden Genie slot machine, anyone looking for multiplier wild symbols, stacked wilds, and wandering icons will have all three wishes come true.\n\nThis is a five-reel, 20-line game featuring the handsome Aladdin, the beautiful Jasmine, and the powerful Genie. The Golden Genie online slot works on both desktop and mobile and brings a touch of magic to casinos with the Nolimit City range.\n\nA genie-like design\n\nThis is not the first game based on the story of an orphaned boy and his magical lamp, and we're sure it won't be the last. The grid of symbols with a golden frame is located on a starry sky background, and the vertical orientation of each symbol helps the game fit on smartphone and tablet screens.\n\nWhether the use of playing card icons is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but they do little to add to the magical theme of the Golden Genie slot machine. A cobra and a leopard are medium-level prizes, and although the leopard doesn't fit the story, the game looks good, so we won't complain.\n\nThe three main characters, each presented in a detailed but cartoonish style, offer the highest prizes. It's part of a relatively small but very popular range from Swedish developer Nolimit City.\n\nThe design is simple but classy in the Golden Genie slot. Based on the classic folk tale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. With a starry night sky in the background, the graphics are colorful and high definition. The bold images have a TV cartoon look. They are well-made.\n\nOn the reels, you'll see real A to 10 next to a leopard, panther, lamp, Aladdin, and a woman. This mysterious woman is the top standard symbol, awarding 1, 3.75, or 25 times your total bet if you land 3, 4 or 5 on a payline.\n\nThe genie is the wild and scatter symbol. It replaces all symbols to create winning combinations. The genie symbol also grants up to 25x your total stake per payline.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nNo need to rub a lamp to unlock the magic. Just spin the reels and watch out for the Genie. It's a wild symbol, behaving like others to complete a winning sequence, and it's also the trigger for a special Genie Parade feature.\n\nYou need at least three Genie symbols in sight, or you can cheat a little and trigger the feature with a bonus bet of 80 times your bet. It sounds like a lot, but so are the potential winnings of this Golden Genie online slot feature.\n\nAll Genies lock in place, and one of the triggering symbols becomes a Golden Genie. The rest of the reels take a breath as all Genies move one reel to the left. This continues with the Golden Genie increasing a multiplier with each respin. If it goes off-screen and other triggering symbols are still on the reels, the accumulated multiplier is transferred to the nearest Genie.\n\nWith a bit of luck, the Genie Parade runs and runs as others appear in respins and multipliers continue to rise.\n\nIt's not the only bonus in the Golden Genie slot machine. The Genie Lamps feature, randomly awarded, sees two and four reels fill with stacked wild lamps. Each new winning combination is calculated, and the game pays from both the left and right sides.\n\nThe Genie Wishes feature is triggered if Aladdin lands on the immediate left of the lamp on any spin. All examples of both symbols become extra wilds and multiply wins by 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, or 10x.\n\nIf you like magical themed slots and enchanting bonuses, you'll love the Golden Genie online slot. The graphics are nothing revolutionary, but we certainly had fun playing it, especially when the precious bonus spins were triggered.\n\nReels with multiplier wild symbols can bring in some big prizes, and the in-game features are almost certainly capable of creating one or two winning combos. If you're thinking of taking the bonus bet option, it's worth knowing that the RTP during the Genie Parade rises to 96.36%.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nPragmatic Play's Aladdin and the Sorcerer slot is also a five-reel, 20-line game. It features stacked wild symbols and reel respins, where the two main characters attach to each other. If Aladdin wins, other prizes in the round are tripled.\n\nGenie Wild, on the other hand, is a NextGen Gaming slot with cartoonish graphics. The female genie is a wild symbol, and during a round of free games, it expands across the reels to help you win extra prizes.\n            ",

The Golden Genie symbol increases the multiplier with each consecutive respin which can lead to big wins. </p>                <p>Next, we have the Genie Lamps feature which randomly awards players with two and four reels filled with stacked wild lamps. This feature can be very lucrative as it can activate more than once during a single spin. </p>                <p>If you are lucky enough to have Aladdin land on the immediate left of the lamp on any given spin, then the Genie Wishes feature will be triggered. This feature allows you to choose from a selection of lamps to reveal cash prizes, multipliers, or extra free spins. Keep an eye out for the purple lamp, as it can trigger the Golden Touch feature which will turn a random symbol wild.</p>                <p>In short, the bonus features in Golden Genie are impressive, adding an element of surprise and increasing the chances of winning big. With captivating graphics and sound effects and exciting gameplay, this is a game that will keep you entertained for hours.

One of the reasons why this game has become so popular among players is its exciting bonus features. Let’s take a closer look at the three main bonus features: Genie Parade, Genie Lamps, and Genie Wishes.</p>\\\n                <p>First up is the Genie Parade, which is triggered when you land three or more Genie symbols on the reels. This feature locks in the Genies and has them move one reel to the left for each respin. The Golden Genie symbol increases the multiplier with each consecutive respin which can lead to big wins. </p>\\\n                <p>Next, we have the Genie Lamps feature which randomly awards players with two and four reels filled with stacked wild lamps. This feature can be very lucrative as it can activate more than once during a single spin. </p>\\\n                <p>If you are lucky enough to have Aladdin land on the immediate left of the lamp on any given spin, then the Genie Wishes feature will be triggered. This feature allows you to choose from a selection of lamps to reveal cash prizes, multipliers, or extra free spins. Keep an eye out for the purple lamp, as it can trigger the Golden Touch feature which will turn a random symbol wild.</p>\\\n                <p>In short, the bonus features in Golden Genie are impressive, adding an element of surprise and increasing the chances of winning big. With captivating graphics and sound effects and exciting gameplay, this is a game that will keep you entertained for hours. And who knows, maybe you’ll even rub the lamp and summon your own real-life genie!</p>\"\n}"

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Features\n\nGolden Genie is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot that features wild and scatter symbols, stacked wilds, and multiple bonus features that are both fun and potentially profitable.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbol\n\nThe Genie symbol is both a wild and scatter symbol in Golden Genie. It can substitute for all other symbols to create winning combinations and can award up to 25x your total stake per payline.\n\nGenie Parade Feature\n\nThe Genie Parade feature in Golden Genie is triggered by landing three or more Genie symbols on the reels. All Genies lock in place, and one of the triggering symbols becomes a Golden Genie. The rest of the reels take a breath as all Genies move one reel to the left. This continues with the Golden Genie increasing a multiplier with each respin. If it goes off-screen and other triggering symbols are still on the reels, the accumulated multiplier is transferred to the nearest Genie.\n\nGenie Lamps Feature\n\nThe Genie Lamps feature is randomly triggered in Golden Genie, and it sees two and four reels fill with stacked wild lamps that pay from both the left and right sides. Each new winning combination is calculated, and the game pays from both the left and right sides.\n\nGenie Wishes Feature\n\nThe Genie Wishes feature in Golden Genie is triggered if Aladdin lands on the immediate left of the lamp on any spin. All examples of both symbols become extra wilds and multiply wins by 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, or 10x.\n\nDesign and Graphics\n\nGolden Genie has a well-made design that is simple but classy. The graphics are colorful and high definition, with a starry night sky background. The images look like they have a TV cartoon look.\n\nStoryline and Theme\n\nGolden Genie is based on the classic folk tale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. The game features the characters Aladdin, Jasmine, and the powerful Genie, and follows the story of uncovering the magic of the Golden Genie.\n\nPayouts and Winnings\n\nIn Golden Genie, the top standard symbol is the mysterious woman, which awards 1, 3.75, or 25 times your total bet if you land 3, 4 or 5 on a payline. The game's bonus features can bring in some big prizes, and the RTP during the Genie Parade rises to 96.36%.\n\n        \n            ",

The game features the popular characters from the classic folk tale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. The game can be played on desktop or mobile devices.\n\nDescription of game mechanics (reels, paylines, special functions)\n\nGolden Genie has a 5-reel, 20-payline setup with 3 functions, including symbols that transform into wilds and provide a multiplier boost, stacked wilds with wins paying both ways, and a bonus game where each walking wild symbol that appears increases a 1x multiplier.\n\nSpecial symbols and their functions (wilds, scatters, multipliers, bonus symbols)\n\nThe genie symbol is both the game's wild and scatter symbol.

The Genie Lamps feature randomly awards players with two and four reels filled with stacked wild lamps, and the Genie Wishes feature is triggered if Aladdin lands on the immediate left of the lamp on any given spin.\n\nMaximum payout and winning potential\n\nDuring the Genie Parade feature, the game's RTP rises to 96.36%. The top standard symbol awards 1, 3.75, or 25 times your total bet if you land 3, 4 or 5 on a payline.\n\nDesign and graphics\n\nThe game features a classic magical genie design with a golden frame and is set against a starry sky background.

Overall, the design is simple, classy and well-made.\n\nGame developer (Nolimit City)\n\nGolden Genie was developed by Nolimit City, a Swedish game developer specializing in online casino games. Nolimit City has a range of popular games known for their quality graphics and gameplay innovations.\n\nOverall impression and recommendation\n\nGolden Genie is a fun and engaging online slot game with exciting features and high payouts.

These include symbols that transform into wilds and provide a multiplier boost, stacked wilds with wins paying both ways, and a bonus game where each walking wild symbol that appears increases a 1x multiplier. Will Aladdin realize his jackpot wishes? Find out in our in-depth review of Golden Genie.\n\nGenies are famous for granting the wishes of those lucky enough to find the magic lamps they call home. With the Golden Genie slot machine, anyone looking for multiplier wild symbols, stacked wilds, and wandering icons will have all three wishes come true.\n\nThis is a five-reel, 20-line game featuring the handsome Aladdin, the beautiful Jasmine, and the powerful Genie. The Golden Genie online slot works on both desktop and mobile and brings a touch of magic to casinos with the Nolimit City range.\n\nA genie-like design\n\nThis is not the first game based on the story of an orphaned boy and his magical lamp, and we're sure it won't be the last. The grid of symbols with a golden frame is located on a starry sky background, and the vertical orientation of each symbol helps the game fit on smartphone and tablet screens.\n\nWhether the use of playing card icons is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but they do little to add to the magical theme of the Golden Genie slot machine. A cobra and a leopard are medium-level prizes, and although the leopard doesn't fit the story, the game looks good, so we won't complain.\n\nThe three main characters, each presented in a detailed but cartoonish style, offer the highest prizes. It's part of a relatively small but very popular range from Swedish developer Nolimit City.\n\nThe design is simple but classy in the Golden Genie slot. Based on the classic folk tale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. With a starry night sky in the background, the graphics are colorful and high definition. The bold images have a TV cartoon look. They are well-made.\n\nOn the reels, you'll see real A to 10 next to a leopard, panther, lamp, Aladdin, and a woman. This mysterious woman is the top standard symbol, awarding 1, 3.75, or 25 times your total bet if you land 3, 4 or 5 on a payline.\n\nThe genie is the wild and scatter symbol. It replaces all symbols to create winning combinations. The genie symbol also grants up to 25x your total stake per payline.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nNo need to rub a lamp to unlock the magic. Just spin the reels and watch out for the Genie. It's a wild symbol, behaving like others to complete a winning sequence, and it's also the trigger for a special Genie Parade feature.\n\nYou need at least three Genie symbols in sight, or you can cheat a little and trigger the feature with a bonus bet of 80 times your bet. It sounds like a lot, but so are the potential winnings of this Golden Genie online slot feature.\n\nAll Genies lock in place, and one of the triggering symbols becomes a Golden Genie. The rest of the reels take a breath as all Genies move one reel to the left. This continues with the Golden Genie increasing a multiplier with each respin. If it goes off-screen and other triggering symbols are still on the reels, the accumulated multiplier is transferred to the nearest Genie.\n\nWith a bit of luck, the Genie Parade runs and runs as others appear in respins and multipliers continue to rise.\n\nIt's not the only bonus in the Golden Genie slot machine. The Genie Lamps feature, randomly awarded, sees two and four reels fill with stacked wild lamps. Each new winning combination is calculated, and the game pays from both the left and right sides.\n\nThe Genie Wishes feature is triggered if Aladdin lands on the immediate left of the lamp on any spin. All examples of both symbols become extra wilds and multiply wins by 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, or 10x.\n\nIf you like magical themed slots and enchanting bonuses, you'll love the Golden Genie online slot. The graphics are nothing revolutionary, but we certainly had fun playing it, especially when the precious bonus spins were triggered.\n\nReels with multiplier wild symbols can bring in some big prizes, and the in-game features are almost certainly capable of creating one or two winning combos. If you're thinking of taking the bonus bet option, it's worth knowing that the RTP during the Genie Parade rises to 96.36%.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nPragmatic Play's Aladdin and the Sorcerer slot is also a five-reel, 20-line game. It features stacked wild symbols and reel respins, where the two main characters attach to each other. If Aladdin wins, other prizes in the round are tripled.\n\nGenie Wild, on the other hand, is a NextGen Gaming slot with cartoonish graphics. The female genie is a wild symbol, and during a round of free games, it expands across the reels to help you win extra prizes.\n            ",

Will Aladdin realize his jackpot wishes? Find out in our in-depth review of Golden Genie.\n\nGenies are famous for granting the wishes of those lucky enough to find the magic lamps they call home. With the Golden Genie slot machine, anyone looking for multiplier wild symbols, stacked wilds, and wandering icons will have all three wishes come true.\n\nThis is a five-reel, 20-line game featuring the handsome Aladdin, the beautiful Jasmine, and the powerful Genie. The Golden Genie online slot works on both desktop and mobile and brings a touch of magic to casinos with the Nolimit City range.\n\nA genie-like design\n\nThis is not the first game based on the story of an orphaned boy and his magical lamp, and we're sure it won't be the last. The grid of symbols with a golden frame is located on a starry sky background, and the vertical orientation of each symbol helps the game fit on smartphone and tablet screens.\n\nWhether the use of playing card icons is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but they do little to add to the magical theme of the Golden Genie slot machine. A cobra and a leopard are medium-level prizes, and although the leopard doesn't fit the story, the game looks good, so we won't complain.\n\nThe three main characters, each presented in a detailed but cartoonish style, offer the highest prizes. It's part of a relatively small but very popular range from Swedish developer Nolimit City.\n\nThe design is simple but classy in the Golden Genie slot. Based on the classic folk tale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. With a starry night sky in the background, the graphics are colorful and high definition. The bold images have a TV cartoon look. They are well-made.\n\nOn the reels, you'll see real A to 10 next to a leopard, panther, lamp, Aladdin, and a woman. This mysterious woman is the top standard symbol, awarding 1, 3.75, or 25 times your total bet if you land 3, 4 or 5 on a payline.\n\nThe genie is the wild and scatter symbol. It replaces all symbols to create winning combinations. The genie symbol also grants up to 25x your total stake per payline.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nNo need to rub a lamp to unlock the magic. Just spin the reels and watch out for the Genie. It's a wild symbol, behaving like others to complete a winning sequence, and it's also the trigger for a special Genie Parade feature.\n\nYou need at least three Genie symbols in sight, or you can cheat a little and trigger the feature with a bonus bet of 80 times your bet. It sounds like a lot, but so are the potential winnings of this Golden Genie online slot feature.\n\nAll Genies lock in place, and one of the triggering symbols becomes a Golden Genie. The rest of the reels take a breath as all Genies move one reel to the left. This continues with the Golden Genie increasing a multiplier with each respin. If it goes off-screen and other triggering symbols are still on the reels, the accumulated multiplier is transferred to the nearest Genie.\n\nWith a bit of luck, the Genie Parade runs and runs as others appear in respins and multipliers continue to rise.\n\nIt's not the only bonus in the Golden Genie slot machine. The Genie Lamps feature, randomly awarded, sees two and four reels fill with stacked wild lamps. Each new winning combination is calculated, and the game pays from both the left and right sides.\n\nThe Genie Wishes feature is triggered if Aladdin lands on the immediate left of the lamp on any spin. All examples of both symbols become extra wilds and multiply wins by 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, or 10x.\n\nIf you like magical themed slots and enchanting bonuses, you'll love the Golden Genie online slot. The graphics are nothing revolutionary, but we certainly had fun playing it, especially when the precious bonus spins were triggered.\n\nReels with multiplier wild symbols can bring in some big prizes, and the in-game features are almost certainly capable of creating one or two winning combos. If you're thinking of taking the bonus bet option, it's worth knowing that the RTP during the Genie Parade rises to 96.36%.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nPragmatic Play's Aladdin and the Sorcerer slot is also a five-reel, 20-line game. It features stacked wild symbols and reel respins, where the two main characters attach to each other. If Aladdin wins, other prizes in the round are tripled.\n\nGenie Wild, on the other hand, is a NextGen Gaming slot with cartoonish graphics. The female genie is a wild symbol, and during a round of free games, it expands across the reels to help you win extra prizes.\n            ",
