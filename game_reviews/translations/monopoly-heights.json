Ad arricchire la griglia di gioco ci sono anche i simboli reali delle carte, ovvero A, K, Q e J, le Automobili, un Anello con diamante, un Diamante, delle Monete, il logo di Monopoly Heights e molto altro ancora. Ricorda che il dado si comporta da simbolo Jolly e ha il compito di sostituire tutti i simboli fatta eccezione per lo Scatter.\nSenza ombra di dubbio la possibilità di espansione è la vera chiave della slot online: tutti i simboli che hai trovato sulla griglia si bloccano e girerà solo la nuova riga aggiunta nella parte alta.\nNon dimentichiamo la funzione jackpot che si attiva quando lo Scatter dell’hotel si posiziona rispettivamente sui rulli 1 e 5 nello stesso momento.

In linea generale sono così calcolati:\n • Mini Jackpot: se riempi 3 spazi puoi vincere un montepremi pari a 10 volte la tua scommessa;\n• Minor: devi riempire 4 spazi e vale 25 volte la tua scommessa;\n• Major: gli spazi da riempire sono 5 per aggiudicarsi 125x la tua puntata;\n• Grand Jackpot: servono 8 spazi pieni e avrai un premio pari a 2.500 volte la tua scommessa.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Monopoly Heights\nMonopoly Heights è una slot molto carina e ben riuscita: il suo è un design simpatico ma sono soprattutto interessanti le funzionalità che possono permettere di potenziare le vincite. Mr Monopoly è in assoluto il simbolo più fortunato e divertente che tu possa incontrare in fase di gioco: espandi le linee di pagamento e preparati a fare un grande incasso!\n",

The RTP is set at 95.85%. The dice symbol is the wild and the Scatter symbol is the hotel. When two hotels appear, the jackpot feature is activated.\n\nTheme\n\nMonopoly Heights is a themed slot game inspired by the famous board game. The game grid is set against a colorful town background with skyscrapers. The game symbols are inspired by the board game, including the Rich Uncle Pennybags, cars, a diamond ring, and more.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics in Monopoly Heights are well done with a cartoon-style background and charming symbols, especially the depiction of Rich Uncle Pennybags. When three symbols of him appear you are treated to an animation where he brings up a new payline with his cane. The royal card symbols, A, K, Q, and J, and other symbols like the cars and diamonds add to the charm.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe key to Monopoly Heights is the expansion feature, where all symbols found on the grid are locked and only the new line added to the top spins. There is also the jackpot feature, where the hotel Scatter symbol needs to appear on reels 1 and 5 and you have to choose between 32 bonus cards to potentially win one of four jackpots: Mini, Minor, Major, and Grand. The dice symbol acts as a wild, while the hotel symbol acts as a Scatter.\n\nPayout\n\nMonopoly Heights has a maximum payout of 2,500 times your bet if you fill 8 spaces of the Grand Jackpot. The Mini Jackpot is worth 10 times your bet, the Minor Jackpot is worth 25 times your bet, and the Major Jackpot is worth 125 times your bet.\n\n        \n            ",

Monopoly Heights is a themed slot machine inspired by the masterpiece signed by Scientific Games. It is produced by the Bally Technologies company, which has achieved its goal. That of entertaining! It comes with a 5-reel structure and offers 1,024 ways to win. However, it should be noted that the chances increase and reach up to 32,768 ways to win if you manage to take advantage of the extra features provided in the gameplay. But to understand the genius of this machine, whose RTP is set at 95.85%, it is essential to delve into its game and be fascinated by its performance.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nMonopoly Heights is well done graphics-wise: on the background we have the realization in cartoon style of a colorful town with its skyscrapers, on which the game grid can be expanded. The charming Rich Uncle Pennybags stands out among the symbols, the mustached grandpa whom we have been seeing depicted on Monopoly boxes for years. When you manage to place 3 icons on the reels, you will receive a pleasant surprise: an animation is started that sees Mister Monopoly use his cane to bring up a new payline. And this is repeated every time a new icon depicting him appears. To enrich the game grid, there are also the royal card symbols, namely A, K, Q, and J, the Cars, a Diamond Ring, a Diamond, Coins, the Monopoly Heights logo, and much more. Remember that the dice acts as a wild symbol and has the task of replacing all symbols except for the Scatter.\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, the expansion feature is the true key to the online slot: all the symbols you have found on the grid will be locked, and only the new line added to the top will spin.\n\nLet's not forget the jackpot feature that is activated when the hotel Scatter is respectively positioned on reels 1 and 5 at the same time. At that point, you will have to choose between 32 bonus cards, and you could get one of the four jackpots you see at the top of the screen. In general, they are calculated as follows:\n• Mini Jackpot: if you fill 3 spaces, you can win a prize equal to 10 times your bet;\n• Minor: you must fill 4 spaces and it's worth 25 times your bet;\n• Major: you need to fill 5 spaces to win 125x your bet;\n• Grand Jackpot: you need to fill 8 spaces and you will receive a prize equal to 2,500 times your bet.\n\nFinal considerations on Monopoly Heights slot\nMonopoly Heights is a very nice and well-made slot: its design is charming, but it is above all the features that can allow you to enhance your winnings that are interesting. Mr. Monopoly is by far the luckiest and most fun symbol you can encounter during gameplay: expand the paylines and get ready for a big win!\n        ",
