It seems like a picture that's truly difficult to avoid.\n\nWe're talking about a slot machine with 6 reels and 6 lines, a \"square\" system that's not very common but still has remarkable dimensions. There are minimum bets, with the possibility of winning up to 5000 times the amount you've put into the game. Is that it? Absolutely not, so let's discover all the new features of Elite of Evil: Portal of Gold together.\n\nA sparkling atmosphere\n\nOne thing you'll see happening very often in a gaming experience with this slot machine concerns explosions: this fantasy world, projected into a universe unknown to us, will lead you to face many evil characters, and battles will be fought following many explosions, which will have an impact both scenically and for your fortunes, as they'll generate additional advantages and benefits in addition to all those already included, starting from prizes to free spins.\n\nThe symbols and functions of Elite of Evil: Portal of Gold\n\nAnd don't think the fun ends here: adrenaline and high rhythms are not only present in big battles; in fact, as soon as you defeat a character, you'll immediately have the chance to access the jackpot mode. This is a classic function that belongs to the noblest traditions of slot machines: by spinning the jackpot wheel, you can obtain many game multipliers, as well as many other earnings. As suggested by the game setting we described earlier, all the symbols that will appear on the reels have to do with a fantasy universe, ready to explode at any moment in a tremendous fight. Besides this, thanks to G Games' deep attachment to the industry's traditions, the joker and scatter symbols couldn't be missing.\n\nIn short, Elite of Evil: Portal of Gold risks being a good alternative even for the most modern gaming consoles: its wonderful gaming experience will never make your moments spent in front of the screen banal. Don't hesitate any longer: we absolutely recommend trying this slot machine.\n        ",
