Proudly made by WMG, this game is based on the constant challenge between the chickens with golden eggs and the greedy fox trying to steal the big jackpot.

Today, we welcome Fowl Play XMas, the Christmas version of the popular game. \nThe slot opens with a Christmas jingle that loops throughout the game, adding to the festive spirit. The game board is set between two colorful poles resembling the North Pole, where Santa's workshop is located.

The symbols include classic Christmas elements such as gingerbread men, presents, colorful balls, and of course, the essential chickens and foxes (dressed in holiday attire or prepared for a Christmas feast). \nAs for the game mechanics, Fowl Play XMas boasts an RTP of 90%, which is lower than the market average of 95/96%, but not unusual for the Fowl Play series. The slot has low volatility, meaning players can expect frequent wins, although not necessarily high-paying. The game board consists of a 5x3 grid, displaying 15 symbols per spin. Despite the low volatility, there are only five starting paylines, limiting the variety and number of possible combinations. However, players can start with lower bets to get used to the game before increasing the number of paylines up to 20, following the market standard for greater possibilities. Special symbols include the fox, a wild symbol that can replace any other symbol in the game, and the chicken on a sled, a scatter symbol that triggers the bonus round. \nFor those seeking similar themed slots, we recommend other titles from the Fowl Play series, such as Fowl Play Gold (for those who want to try the original game), Fowl Play Centurion (for ancient Rome enthusiasts), and even Fowl Play London, for fans of Sherlock Holmes-inspired stories.

It features egg-laying hens and a fox competing for a rich booty. Fowl Play XMas is a Christmas-themed variation of the game that uses a 5*3 mechanism and 5 paylines, though players can increase the number of paylines up to 20. The game has low volatility, which means players can expect to win often, albeit not necessarily high-value prizes. The slot machine uses an RTP of 90%, which is lower than the market average of 95/96%. The game includes Wild and Scatter symbols represented by the Fox and the Chicken on the Sled, respectively. There are several other Fowl Play series slots available for those who enjoy this game's theme.\n        ",

While the game's volatility is on the lower side, with starting paylines of only 5, you can increase them up to 20 paylines to create even more combinations.</p><p>Now, let's talk about the special symbols - the Fox and the Chicken on the Sled. The Fox symbol is wild, which means it can replace all other symbols in the game. So, it's like having a sneaky fox on your team, helping create more winning combinations. On the other hand, the Chicken on the Sled is the scatter symbol, and if you get it, you have unlocked the bonus round, where you can win even bigger prizes for your efforts. Who knew chickens could be so generous?</p><p>All in all, the gameplay of Fowl Play Gold Xmas is essentially the same as its predecessor, only dressed with Christmas decorations and festive tunes. The game doesn't bring anything new to the table, but if you're looking for a fun and straightforward game to play this holiday season, then this one shouldn't disappoint.</p>\"\n}"

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics\n\nFowl Play Gold Xmas has a low RTP of 90%, which is not uncommon for the Fowl Play series slots. It has low volatility, but the starting paylines are only 5. Special symbols include the Wild symbol, represented by the Fox and the Chicken on the Sled which is a Scatter Symbol giving access to the bonus mode. The game grid uses a 5*3 type mechanism, with 15 symbols shown on each spin, and it is possible to increase the number of paylines up to 20, reaching market standards for the opportunity to obtain more combinations.\n\nBonus Features\n\nFowl Play Gold Xmas offers a bonus mode that can be activated by landing three or more Chicken on the Sled symbols. Before starting the bonus game, a second screen appears with three chests to choose from. The chest opens to reveal the number of free spins. Players can win up to 20 free spins, and during this mode, each winning combination is multiplied by three.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nWith its low volatility, Fowl Play Gold Xmas provides players with regular wins, but they may not necessarily be high in value. The slot machine uses an RTP of 90%, which is lower than the market average RTP of 95/96%. This low value is commonplace with Fowl Play series slots.\n\nGame Theme and Graphics\n\nAs a Christmas themed slot machine, Fowl Play Gold Xmas features a winter background with colorful poles, gingerbread men, Christmas gifts and colored balls, and of course, foxes and chickens. The background music is a cheerful Christmas jingle, and the game interface is designed to portray the North Pole where Santa's factory is often located.\n\nVariety of Fowl Play Series Slots\n\nThe Fowl Play series slots consist of different themes and settings; Fowl Play Gold is the original title, Fowl Play Centurion features ancient Rome, and Fowl Play London depicts the stories of Sherlock Holmes. Players looking for slots with a similar theme should explore the other titles in the Fowl Play series.\n\n        \n            ",

The game uses a 5*3 type mechanism, with fifteen symbols shown on each spin. The game's volatility is low, with starting paylines of only 5, so the variety of combinations will be conditioned by the shortage of lines along which to be distributed. However, it is possible to increase the number of paylines up to 20 to obtain many more combinations. The game's special symbols are the Fox, which is a Wild symbol that replaces all other normal symbols in the game, and the Chicken on the Sled, which is a Scatter Symbol that grants access to the bonus round.\n\nSymbols\n\nFowl Play Gold Xmas features symbols expected from a Christmas theme, such as gingerbread men, gifts, colored balls, and foxes and chickens dressed up in Christmas gear or plated for Christmas lunch. The game's special symbols are the Fox, which is a Wild symbol that replaces all other normal symbols in the game, and the Chicken on the Sled, which is a Scatter Symbol that grants access to the bonus round.\n\nChristmas Theme\n\nFowl Play Gold Xmas has a Christmas theme, with the game grid enclosed between two colorful poles reminiscent of the North Pole and the cute old man flying away on his sleigh in the upper left corner. The symbols found inside the grid add to the Christmas theme, with gingerbread men, gifts, colored balls, and foxes and chickens dressed up or plated for Christmas lunch. An accompanying looped music plays throughout the various plays, reminiscent of the many Christmas jingles heard in December.\n\nVolatility\n\nFowl Play Gold Xmas has low volatility, meaning that players can expect wins more frequently, although not necessarily high in value. This is due to the low RTP of 90%. However, the game's starting paylines are only 5, so the variety of combinations will be limited. Players can increase the number of paylines up to 20 to achieve more combinations.\n\nOther Fowl Play Games\n\nFor those who enjoy the Fowl Play series, Fowl Play Gold Xmas is a great addition, featuring a Christmas-themed game with a low volatility. Other recommended titles in the series include Fowl Play Gold, the original title, Fowl Play Centurion for those who love ancient Rome, and Fowl Play London for those who appreciate Sherlock Holmes stories.\n\n        \n            ",

The game grid is enclosed between two colorful poles reminiscent of those of the North Pole where Santa's factory is located.\n\nAnd it is precisely the North Pole that forms the background of the entire game interface, with the cute old man flying away on his sleigh in the upper left.\n\nThe symbols found inside the grid are those you can expect from a theme of this type: gingerbread men, gifts, colored balls, and of course, foxes and chickens (the latter dressed in Christmas theme or plated for Christmas lunch).\n\nFowl Play XMas - Gameplay mechanics\n\nLet's now focus on the technical aspects of Fowl Play XMas: we are faced with a slot machine that uses an RTP of 90%.

Proudly Italian, WMG slot machines are based on the continuous challenge between egg-laying hens and a fox trying to seize a rich booty.\n\nOver time, numerous variations have emerged that introduce this theme into very different settings (we'll discuss this in the section dedicated to slots similar to this one), and now Fowl Play XMas, the Christmas slot machine, has arrived on the market.\n\nFowl Play XMas - It's finally Christmas\n\nThe slot machine opens with a looped music that will accompany us throughout our various plays and sounds like one of the many Christmas jingles heard in December. The game grid is enclosed between two colorful poles reminiscent of those of the North Pole where Santa's factory is located.\n\nAnd it is precisely the North Pole that forms the background of the entire game interface, with the cute old man flying away on his sleigh in the upper left.\n\nThe symbols found inside the grid are those you can expect from a theme of this type: gingerbread men, gifts, colored balls, and of course, foxes and chickens (the latter dressed in Christmas theme or plated for Christmas lunch).\n\nFowl Play XMas - Gameplay mechanics\n\nLet's now focus on the technical aspects of Fowl Play XMas: we are faced with a slot machine that uses an RTP of 90%. A low value, considering the market average around 95/96%, but not uncommon for Fowl Play series slots.\n\nThe slot machine's volatility is low, so we can expect not to wait too long to see some wins, although not necessarily high in value. The game grid uses a 5*3 type mechanism, with fifteen symbols shown on each spin.\n\nDespite the low volatility, the starting paylines are only 5, so the number and variety of combinations will be conditioned by the shortage of lines along which to be distributed. Fortunately, it is possible to bet rather low amounts if we want to take some time to get used to the same slot.\n\nAt this point, it will be possible to increase the number of paylines up to 20, reaching market standards and obtaining the opportunity to obtain many more combinations.\n\nSpecial symbols are represented by the Fox, which is a Wild symbol capable of replacing all other normal symbols in the game, and the Chicken on the Sled, which is instead a Scatter Symbol that allows access to the bonus mode.\n\nSimilar slots to Fowl Play XMas\n\nFor those looking for slots with the same flavor, we can only recommend other titles in the Fowl Play series: from Fowl Play Gold (for those who want to try the original title) to Fowl Play Centurion (for lovers of ancient Rome) and even Fowl Play London, for those who have appreciated the stories of Sherlock Holmes.\n        ",
