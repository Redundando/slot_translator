Parliamo delle meraviglie che sono state inserite all’interno del gameplay della slot Golden Ticket 2, firmata da Play N Go. Partiamo da una struttura composta da una griglia 5×5 che tratta, come accennato, il tema circense per catapultare il giocatore negli anni ’20. Grazie ai suoi simboli a cascata è possibile mettere a segno una serie importante di vincite consecutive che vanno ad aumentare il valore finale del moltiplicatore. Troviamo anche qui gli imperdibili giri gratuiti e le funzioni Jolly che meritano di essere approfondite nel capitolo successivo. Ma prima di procedere è giusto svelare il suo RTP che è fissato a un 96,5%, valore al di sopra della media per le macchinette online. \nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nEntriamo in un tendone ricco di premi dove si sbloccano le vincite grazie all’abbinamento di 3 o più simboli uguali in orizzontale o in verticale. Il gioco altro non è che il secondo capitolo della slot Golden Ticket che aveva già riscosso un discreto successo. Sotto l’aspetto grafico è un vero colpo di genio: moderna, intuitiva e facile da giocare. I suoi colori luminosi coinvolgono il giocatore e lo accompagnano in un’avventura che è coinvolgente fin dal primo minuto.\nAnche in questo caso abbiamo i classici oggetti di scena sulla griglia: dai coltelli al bersaglio, passando per il Clown. Il più alto valore assoluto è quello attribuito al simbolo del Ringmaster, seguito dal lanciatore e dal Clown. Ognuno paga 0,5, 1 o 10 volte la puntata in base alla combinazione formata da 3, 4 o 5 simboli uguali. Il simbolo Wild invece è quello che rappresenta il tendone.\nDurante il gameplay è possibile sbloccare 4 funzioni bonus, partendo dai simboli a cascata e i moltiplicatori crescenti, che si uniscono ai moltiplicatori jolly e alla funzione Giri gratuiti. Nel caso in cui si liberi un’intera riga del bonus si possono attivare in combo Free Spin e moltiplicatori: \n • 5 giri con moltiplicatore 3x;\n• 7 spin e moltiplicatore 2x;\n• 9 giri e moltiplicatore 1x.\nQuando un giocatore riesce a liberare l’intera griglia, svuotandola dalle icone di gioco, è possibile vincere un premio pari a 50 volte la tua puntata. \nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Golden Ticket 2\nLa slot Golden Ticket 2 è in assoluto uno dei titoli più belli che siano mai stati presentati sul mercato del gambling online. Il tema non è dei più originali, ma è presentato e sviluppato in modo impeccabile. Sorprende non solo per la sua grafica ma anche per le animazioni che si alternano sulla griglia, grazie anche ai moltiplicatori e alle sue funzionalità bonus. In base ai dati registrati questa slot permette di mettere mano su una vincita di 20.578 volte la scommessa che viene effettuata dal gamer. Per riuscire però a superare ogni limite e puntare sempre più in alto è ideale avere fortuna con i moltiplicatori che possono far balzare la tua vittoria alle stelle.\nSe le tue aspettative sono alte, le tue vincite potranno esserlo ancora di più!\n",
