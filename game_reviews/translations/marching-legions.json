These reels traverse 243 ways to win, which means that wins are made by matching symbols regardless of their position on the line. Players will find high variance in Marching Legions, an impressive theoretical return to player of 98.12% and a maximum win potential of 10,000x multiplied by the winning bet.\n\nThe armies of ancient Rome invade the five reels of Relax Gaming's Marching Legions online slot. The cartoon-style graphics feature swords, banners, and laurel wreaths, while piles of legionnaires conquer entire reels at a time. These stacked symbols trigger respins, accumulating a meter and leading to a free spin bonus round. Advancing through a series of waves, it is possible to win 10,000x your total bet during the free games.\n\nMarching Legions slot machine is a fun and fast-paced game with an exceptionally high return to player percentage of 98.12%.\n\nAncient Rome graphics\nRelax Gaming takes us to a public square in ancient Rome where the main attraction is the legionnaires representing the defining symbol of the game. This symbol is provided in single units to cover a square on the grid, but being legions, and marching towards it, invites that symbol to appear in stacks along the entire reel. \n\nThe visual field on the Marching Legions slots is full of movement. Soldiers march towards the reel-set, there are slams and thuds when the push feature triggers, and a few other visual bits and pieces that make the game fun. The symbols are drawn similar to a video game, with a total of three low-cost symbols, three high-cost symbols, and the legionnaires. \n\nAs the game loads on PC or mobile, there is a beautiful animated sequence where soldiers start their march under a scorching sun. The scene then transforms into a bird's-eye view of a Roman road, with a temple above, and statues below. The 5x3 symbol grid is skillfully intertwined in the stone of the road. You need to land three or more matching symbols across the reels, from the left side, you have 243 different ways to win. \n\nAlongside the Roman soldiers and other high-value theme symbols, you'll see a stone-effect eagle, a temple, and Caesar's profile. A soundtrack that could come from an epic Roman movie accompanies the game.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nRelax Gaming has provided players with the familiar layout for game controls and buttons. These are located below the reel-set, at the bottom of the screen. Here players can set up the gameplay that awaits them or change the settings at any time.\n\nTo start spinning the reels and invite Marching Legions figurines, press the double arrow button at the bottom center. This causes the reels to spin once for the active bet. Another way to play is hands-free. This is possible with the autoplay option.\n\nPress the button to the right of Spin to open the menu where you can select preset autoplay spins. There are optional settings that allow players to set spending limits or stop autoplay mode when the bonus feature is triggered.\n\nFinally, but not least, there is the sound button in the bottom-left corner of the screen and the menu, where players can view the game rules or browse the paytable. Bets in Marching Legions start at 10 cents per spin and end at a maximum of 100.00 euros.\n\nThe game has two reel modifiers. One is the Marching Respins. It is triggered when a stack of three legionnaires falls on the reels. The soldiers will march a reel to the left for every remaining turn, until the reels exit. Each additional stack results in another series of respins.\n\nLanding two or more stacks of legionnaires can trigger a push feature, which causes the stack to fill up and trigger the respin.\n\nThe free spins bonus is triggered when there have been five stacks of legionnaires that have marched towards the leftmost reel. Free Spins come in waves. Each wave starts with a stack of soldiers leaving the fifth reel and marching towards the first.\n\nThe Buy Feature function allows you to buy the feature at a huge 120x multiplied by the bet.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nNaturally, Roman life was not all marching through the Empire. They also enjoyed a good party, which is the subject of High 5 Games' Roman Revelry online slot. It is another five-reel, 243 ways-to-win game with a cartoon aesthetic. Roman gods have fun in a garden, triggering free spins. A Blinking Buck feature leads to a big credit payout or entry into a jackpot round.\n\nAn epic film arrives in online casinos with Playtech's Gladiator slot machine. Real images of the main cast (minus Russell Crowe) appear on the five reels and 25 lines.

The symbols are drawn similar to a video game, with a total of three low-cost symbols, three high-cost symbols, and the legionnaires. \n\nAs the game loads on PC or mobile, there is a beautiful animated sequence where soldiers start their march under a scorching sun.

Free Spins come in waves. Each wave starts with a stack of soldiers leaving the fifth reel and marching towards the first.\n\nThe Buy Feature function allows you to buy the feature at a huge 120x multiplied by the bet.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nNaturally, Roman life was not all marching through the Empire.

These reels traverse 243 ways to win, which means that wins are made by matching symbols regardless of their position on the line. Players will find high variance in Marching Legions, an impressive theoretical return to player of 98.12% and a maximum win potential of 10,000x multiplied by the winning bet.\n\nThe armies of ancient Rome invade the five reels of Relax Gaming's Marching Legions online slot. The cartoon-style graphics feature swords, banners, and laurel wreaths, while piles of legionnaires conquer entire reels at a time. These stacked symbols trigger respins, accumulating a meter and leading to a free spin bonus round. Advancing through a series of waves, it is possible to win 10,000x your total bet during the free games.\n\nMarching Legions slot machine is a fun and fast-paced game with an exceptionally high return to player percentage of 98.12%.\n\nAncient Rome graphics\nRelax Gaming takes us to a public square in ancient Rome where the main attraction is the legionnaires representing the defining symbol of the game. This symbol is provided in single units to cover a square on the grid, but being legions, and marching towards it, invites that symbol to appear in stacks along the entire reel. \n\nThe visual field on the Marching Legions slots is full of movement. Soldiers march towards the reel-set, there are slams and thuds when the push feature triggers, and a few other visual bits and pieces that make the game fun. The symbols are drawn similar to a video game, with a total of three low-cost symbols, three high-cost symbols, and the legionnaires. \n\nAs the game loads on PC or mobile, there is a beautiful animated sequence where soldiers start their march under a scorching sun. The scene then transforms into a bird's-eye view of a Roman road, with a temple above, and statues below. The 5x3 symbol grid is skillfully intertwined in the stone of the road. You need to land three or more matching symbols across the reels, from the left side, you have 243 different ways to win. \n\nAlongside the Roman soldiers and other high-value theme symbols, you'll see a stone-effect eagle, a temple, and Caesar's profile. A soundtrack that could come from an epic Roman movie accompanies the game.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nRelax Gaming has provided players with the familiar layout for game controls and buttons. These are located below the reel-set, at the bottom of the screen. Here players can set up the gameplay that awaits them or change the settings at any time.\n\nTo start spinning the reels and invite Marching Legions figurines, press the double arrow button at the bottom center. This causes the reels to spin once for the active bet. Another way to play is hands-free. This is possible with the autoplay option.\n\nPress the button to the right of Spin to open the menu where you can select preset autoplay spins. There are optional settings that allow players to set spending limits or stop autoplay mode when the bonus feature is triggered.\n\nFinally, but not least, there is the sound button in the bottom-left corner of the screen and the menu, where players can view the game rules or browse the paytable. Bets in Marching Legions start at 10 cents per spin and end at a maximum of 100.00 euros.\n\nThe game has two reel modifiers. One is the Marching Respins. It is triggered when a stack of three legionnaires falls on the reels. The soldiers will march a reel to the left for every remaining turn, until the reels exit. Each additional stack results in another series of respins.\n\nLanding two or more stacks of legionnaires can trigger a push feature, which causes the stack to fill up and trigger the respin.\n\nThe free spins bonus is triggered when there have been five stacks of legionnaires that have marched towards the leftmost reel. Free Spins come in waves. Each wave starts with a stack of soldiers leaving the fifth reel and marching towards the first.\n\nThe Buy Feature function allows you to buy the feature at a huge 120x multiplied by the bet.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nNaturally, Roman life was not all marching through the Empire. They also enjoyed a good party, which is the subject of High 5 Games' Roman Revelry online slot. It is another five-reel, 243 ways-to-win game with a cartoon aesthetic. Roman gods have fun in a garden, triggering free spins. A Blinking Buck feature leads to a big credit payout or entry into a jackpot round.\n\nAn epic film arrives in online casinos with Playtech's Gladiator slot machine. Real images of the main cast (minus Russell Crowe) appear on the five reels and 25 lines. Features include a prize-pickpot round and a free spins feature that can bring the riches of Rome to you in any spin.\n            ",
