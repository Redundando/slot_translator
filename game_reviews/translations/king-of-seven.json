TPG, the provider of the game, has designed the symbols with bright colors and larger-than-life graphics, that will surely delight even the most discerning gamblers. The gaming grid is set against a black background, with a golden frame dividing the reels into 15 compartments. The console is found at the bottom of the screen, providing options to adjust your bets and initiate the game. On the left-hand side are buttons to turn off the background music and sound effects while the payout table is located on the right side. \n\nThe game offers minimal stakes yet astonishing payouts. You can play with a minimum stake of 0.1 € for each of the 25 fixed pay lines that span across a 5x3 grid. The King of Seven offers an intriguing gameplay where winning symbols will remain fixed on the reels for your next spin, while only the losing symbols will change. This makes it possible to land longer and more lucrative symbol strings or even generate entirely new winning combinations. Payouts are awarded only after the last spin with no winning combinations. Another classic function is the autoplay feature, where you can choose to have your spins from 10 to 999, including a button to speed up the spinning process.\n\nThe game boasts both low and high payout symbols, including two special ones. The low payout symbols are the playing cards from Jack to Ace, with a payout ranging from 4-10 times your initial bet with a combination of five symbols. On the other hand, the high payout symbols consist of the horseshoe, cherry, four-leaf clover, bell, and the number 7, with payouts from 12.5 times your bet for the horseshoe up to 100 times your bet for the number 7. The Wild symbol, the diamond, will substitute for all the other symbols except the Scatter symbol, represented by the silver star. Landing five to 15 scatter symbols will trigger the game's bonus round, offering 10 to 30 free spins with a 3x multiplier for all wins. The free spins can be reactivated multiple times, providing endless chances of winning big. \n\nOverall, King of Seven is a must-try classic-themed slot game that delivers enticing payouts and impressive graphics.

TPG, the provider of the game, has designed the symbols with bright colors and larger-than-life graphics, that will surely delight even the most discerning gamblers. The gaming grid is set against a black background, with a golden frame dividing the reels into 15 compartments. The console is found at the bottom of the screen, providing options to adjust your bets and initiate the game. On the left-hand side are buttons to turn off the background music and sound effects while the payout table is located on the right side. \n\nThe game offers minimal stakes yet astonishing payouts. You can play with a minimum stake of 0.1 € for each of the 25 fixed pay lines that span across a 5x3 grid. The King of Seven offers an intriguing gameplay where winning symbols will remain fixed on the reels for your next spin, while only the losing symbols will change. This makes it possible to land longer and more lucrative symbol strings or even generate entirely new winning combinations. Payouts are awarded only after the last spin with no winning combinations. Another classic function is the autoplay feature, where you can choose to have your spins from 10 to 999, including a button to speed up the spinning process.\n\nThe game boasts both low and high payout symbols, including two special ones. The low payout symbols are the playing cards from Jack to Ace, with a payout ranging from 4-10 times your initial bet with a combination of five symbols. On the other hand, the high payout symbols consist of the horseshoe, cherry, four-leaf clover, bell, and the number 7, with payouts from 12.5 times your bet for the horseshoe up to 100 times your bet for the number 7. The Wild symbol, the diamond, will substitute for all the other symbols except the Scatter symbol, represented by the silver star. Landing five to 15 scatter symbols will trigger the game's bonus round, offering 10 to 30 free spins with a 3x multiplier for all wins. The free spins can be reactivated multiple times, providing endless chances of winning big. \n\nOverall, King of Seven is a must-try classic-themed slot game that delivers enticing payouts and impressive graphics. Make sure to give it a spin and see for yourself what this game has in store for you.\n        ",
