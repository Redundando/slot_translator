Delve into one of the world's oldest civilizations and uncover its secrets in Egyptian Experience, the slot machine produced by Novomatic. \n\nThis online slot with five reels and three rows takes you on a journey through pyramid mazes full of treasures from ancient Egypt. Playable from just 0.10 credits per spin, the game offers wins on 10 paylines, with the chance to win up to 9,000x your bet line by matching symbols on reels that look like they're covered in papyrus paper.\n\nThe mask of Tutankhamun's death is the wild symbol, which doubles all wins when it substitutes. You can unlock even more treasures by entering the Free Spins mode, where all wins are multiplied by 3x. And if you're feeling bold, you can enter the gambling mode for the chance to double your wins.\n\nThe graphics of Egyptian Experience transport you back in time to ancient Egypt, with all the symbols appearing against a backdrop of papyrus paper. Each of the five reels is adorned with a blue and gold frame reminiscent of the famous funerary mask of Tutankhamun.\n\nThe symbols of the playing cards, ranging from 9 to Ace, are carved in limestone. You'll also see camels, boats, pharaoh statues, and the Great Sphinx of Giza during your journey through ancient Egypt. The funerary mask of King Tutankhamun pays the most as the wild symbol, delivering wins up to 9,000x your bet line.\n\nUnfortunately, the sound effects do not immerse you in the theme. They're the same stock sounds you'll be used to hearing if you've played online slots developed by Novomatic in the past.\n\nYou can adjust the 10 paylines when you play Egyptian Experience online. However, with such a generous selection of betting options, why risk losing any wins?\n\nCoin values of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50, and 1 are available. This means you can explore treasure-filled pyramids for as little as 0.10 credits per spin. Have deeper pockets? Then you might be interested in betting up to 100 credits when playing with real money in an online casino.\n\nOur review of the Egyptian Experience slot machine reveals a return-to-player (RTP) of 95.06%. While the Austrian gambling giant has no idea how volatile it is, our experts agreed that it's probably a medium volatility online slot. It certainly played that way when we put it to the test.\n\nYou may have noticed that the ankh is one of the most common hieroglyphic symbols when playing online slots with an ancient Egyptian theme. Therefore, you shouldn't be surprised to see it as the scatter symbol when spinning the reels of the Egyptian Experience slot machine.\n\nWins of 2x, 5x, 20x, or 500x are awarded for finding two, three, four, or five scatter symbols, respectively. Three or more ankh hieroglyph symbols result in pharaoh's rewards, granting you 15 free games. Not only is it possible to trigger the feature again, but all accumulated wins are generously multiplied by 3x.\n\nThe Egyptian Experience online slot machine also allows you to gamble after each winning spin. If you choose to activate the gambling feature, simply guess whether the next card will be red or black. Your win is doubled when you guess correctly, while the pharaohs take your win when you're wrong.\n\nEgyptian Experience may not be the best Egyptian-themed slot we've ever reviewed, but it's far from the worst. Although it looks ancient, the winning animations are surprisingly good. We particularly enjoyed watching the worker chipping away at the limestone to build a pyramid.\n\nThe wild symbols that pay out up to 9,000x your bet line and the free games mode with all wins tripled are the main reasons to play the Egyptian Experience online slot.\n\nOther similar slot machines include A While on the Nile by NextGen Gaming, which offers 50 paylines and rewards fit for a pharaoh for matching symbols such as beetles and pyramids. It also boasts NextGen's SuperBet feature, as well as a pick'em game and free spins. Alternatively, you could join Rich Wilde in the popular Play'n GO slot Book of Dead.

Egyptian Experience, produced by Novomatic, invites experienced gamblers to explore one of the oldest civilizations and its secrets. This online slot game, playable from just 0.10 credits per spin, has five reels and three rows offering wins on 10 paylines. You can win up to 9,000x your line bet by matching symbols on reels that resemble papyrus paper. \n\nThe death mask of Tutankhamun represents the Wild symbol, doubling all wins it substitutes. Unlock even more treasures by entering the Free Spins mode, where all wins are tripled. For the bold, there's also a gambling mode for the chance to double your wins. \n\nThe graphics transport you to ancient Egypt, accentuated by the papyrus paper backdrop against which all the symbols appear. You will see camels, boats, pharaoh statues, and the Great Sphinx of Giza on your journey. The stone-carved playing card symbols range from 9 to Ace, and the death mask of Tutankhamun pays out the most as the Wild symbol, delivering wins up to 9,000x your line bet. \n\nWhile the sound effects don't quite immerse you in the theme, Egyptian Experience is still a solid choice for those seeking adventure in the world of online slots. The game has an RTP of 95.06%, and while Austrian gambling giant Novomatic doesn't specify volatility, our experts agree that it's likely a medium volatility slot. \n\nThe ankh is a common hieroglyphic symbol in Ancient Egyptian-themed slots, hence its appearance as the Scatter symbol when you spin the reels of Egyptian Experience. The Scatter symbol awards wins of 2x, 5x, 20x, or 500x for finding two, three, four, or five symbols respectively. Three or more ankh symbols result in the Pharaohs' Treasure feature, which grants 15 free games, and all wins earned during it are generously multiplied by 3x. \n\nEgyptian Experience also allows you to gamble after each win, simply by guessing whether the next card will be red or black. Choosing right doubles your winnings, but choose wrongly, and the Pharaohs will take your winnings away. \n\nWhile not the best Ancient Egyptian-themed slot we've reviewed, Egyptian Experience is certainly not the worst. The winning animations are impressively well-done, and we particularly enjoyed watching the worker chisel the limestone to build a pyramid. The Wild symbols that pay up to 9,000x your line bet and the free games feature with all wins tripled are the primary reasons to give Egyptian Experience a spin. \n\nOther similar slot games to check out after playing Egyptian Experience include A While on the Nile by NextGen Gaming, which has 50 paylines and features SuperBet and a pick 'em game, as well as Book of Dead by Play'n GO, offering free spins triggered by three or more golden books and expanding special symbols for wins up to 5,000x your bet."

While the Austrian gambling giant has no idea how volatile it is, our experts agreed that it's probably a medium volatility online slot.

Three or more ankh hieroglyph symbols result in pharaoh's rewards, granting you 15 free games.

It also boasts NextGen's SuperBet feature, as well as a pick'em game and free spins. Alternatively, you could join Rich Wilde in the popular Play'n GO slot Book of Dead. Like Egyptian Experience, this free slot allows you to spin the reels for just 0.10 credits.

It certainly played that way when we put it to the test.\n\nYou may have noticed that the ankh is one of the most common hieroglyphic symbols when playing online slots with an ancient Egyptian theme. Therefore, you shouldn't be surprised to see it as the scatter symbol when spinning the reels of the Egyptian Experience slot machine.\n\nWins of 2x, 5x, 20x, or 500x are awarded for finding two, three, four, or five scatter symbols, respectively. Three or more ankh hieroglyph symbols result in pharaoh's rewards, granting you 15 free games. Not only is it possible to trigger the feature again, but all accumulated wins are generously multiplied by 3x.\n\nThe Egyptian Experience online slot machine also allows you to gamble after each winning spin. If you choose to activate the gambling feature, simply guess whether the next card will be red or black. Your win is doubled when you guess correctly, while the pharaohs take your win when you're wrong.\n\nEgyptian Experience may not be the best Egyptian-themed slot we've ever reviewed, but it's far from the worst. Although it looks ancient, the winning animations are surprisingly good. We particularly enjoyed watching the worker chipping away at the limestone to build a pyramid.\n\nThe wild symbols that pay out up to 9,000x your bet line and the free games mode with all wins tripled are the main reasons to play the Egyptian Experience online slot.\n\nOther similar slot machines include A While on the Nile by NextGen Gaming, which offers 50 paylines and rewards fit for a pharaoh for matching symbols such as beetles and pyramids. It also boasts NextGen's SuperBet feature, as well as a pick'em game and free spins. Alternatively, you could join Rich Wilde in the popular Play'n GO slot Book of Dead. Like Egyptian Experience, this free slot allows you to spin the reels for just 0.10 credits. Find three or more golden books to spin the reels for free with a special expansion symbol for the chance to win up to 5,000x your bet.\n            ",

Delve into one of the world's oldest civilizations and uncover its secrets in Egyptian Experience, the slot machine produced by Novomatic. \n\nThis online slot with five reels and three rows takes you on a journey through pyramid mazes full of treasures from ancient Egypt. Playable from just 0.10 credits per spin, the game offers wins on 10 paylines, with the chance to win up to 9,000x your bet line by matching symbols on reels that look like they're covered in papyrus paper.\n\nThe mask of Tutankhamun's death is the wild symbol, which doubles all wins when it substitutes. You can unlock even more treasures by entering the Free Spins mode, where all wins are multiplied by 3x. And if you're feeling bold, you can enter the gambling mode for the chance to double your wins.\n\nThe graphics of Egyptian Experience transport you back in time to ancient Egypt, with all the symbols appearing against a backdrop of papyrus paper. Each of the five reels is adorned with a blue and gold frame reminiscent of the famous funerary mask of Tutankhamun.\n\nThe symbols of the playing cards, ranging from 9 to Ace, are carved in limestone. You'll also see camels, boats, pharaoh statues, and the Great Sphinx of Giza during your journey through ancient Egypt. The funerary mask of King Tutankhamun pays the most as the wild symbol, delivering wins up to 9,000x your bet line.\n\nUnfortunately, the sound effects do not immerse you in the theme. They're the same stock sounds you'll be used to hearing if you've played online slots developed by Novomatic in the past.\n\nYou can adjust the 10 paylines when you play Egyptian Experience online. However, with such a generous selection of betting options, why risk losing any wins?\n\nCoin values of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50, and 1 are available. This means you can explore treasure-filled pyramids for as little as 0.10 credits per spin. Have deeper pockets? Then you might be interested in betting up to 100 credits when playing with real money in an online casino.\n\nOur review of the Egyptian Experience slot machine reveals a return-to-player (RTP) of 95.06%.

This exciting casino slot game is all about immersing yourself in the mysteries of ancient Egypt while having the opportunity to win big. </p><p>With bets starting from just 0.10 credits per spin, players have the chance to win up to 9,000x the bet line by matching symbols on the reels. That's enough to fill up the treasure room of a pyramid! You'll definitely need some luck on your side, though. Pro tip: rubbing a cat's belly might do the trick.</p><p>One of the most exciting features of Egyptian Experience is its wild symbol: the mask of Tutankhamun's death. Not only is it an amazing-looking symbol, but it doubles all the wins it substitutes for. That's one powerful wild! It's almost like having a genie on your side, granting your every wish.</p><p>But wait, there's more! Egyptian Experience also offers a Free Spins mode, where the treasures you can find are even greater. In this mode, all wins are multiplied by 3x. So, not only do you get a chance to explore the mysteries of Egypt, but you also have the possibility of striking it rich. Who knows? Maybe you'll even become the next Howard Carter, discovering a hidden tomb filled with gold and treasures.</p>\"\n}"

It has an ancient Egyptian theme and immerses players in the mysteries of pyramid mazes and hidden treasures.\n\nGameplay and winning potential\n\nPlayers can place bets from just 0.10 credits per spin, and the game offers wins on ten bet lines, with the chance to win up to 9,000x the bet line by matching symbols on the reels. The game also features a wild symbol, which is the mask of Tutankhamun's death. This wild symbol doubles all wins when it substitutes, and there are more treasures to be found in the Free Spins mode, where all wins are multiplied by 3x.\n\nSymbols and bonus features\n\nThe symbols of the playing cards range from 9 to Ace, and they are carved in limestone. Players will also come across camels, boats, pharaoh statues, and the Great Sphinx of Giza. The funerary mask of King Tutankhamun pays the most and delivers wins up to 9,000x the bet line as the wild symbol. The ankh is the scatter symbol, and players can win 2x, 5x, 20x, or 500x by finding two, three, four, or five scatter symbols, respectively. Three or more ankh hieroglyph symbols trigger the Free Spins mode, resulting in 15 free games where all wins are multiplied by 3x. The game also features a gambling mode where players can double their wins by guessing whether the next card is red or black.\n\nFree Spins mode\n\nThe Free Spins mode is triggered when three or more ankh hieroglyph symbols appear on the reels. Players are awarded 15 free games, and all accumulated wins are multiplied by 3x. It is also possible to trigger the feature again.\n\nGambling mode\n\nThe gambling feature in Egyptian Experience allows players to double their wins by guessing whether the next card will be red or black. If players guess correctly, their win is doubled. However, when they guess wrong, the pharaohs take their win.\n\nReturn-to-player (RTP)\n\nThe return-to-player (RTP) for the Egyptian Experience online slot machine is 95.06%. While the volatility of the game is unknown, it is estimated to be a medium volatility game.\n\nVolatility and target audience\n\nOur review suggests that the Egyptian Experience slot is a medium volatility game with a target audience of players who enjoy online slots with an ancient Egyptian theme. Players who like to play slots for small bets will appreciate the ability to explore the treasure-filled pyramids for as little as 0.10 credits per spin. Meanwhile, the max bet of 100 credits will appeal to high rollers.\n\n        \n            ",

To win, you need to match symbols on the paylines from left to right, starting with the leftmost reel. Betting starts at 0.10 credits per spin, and the game offers a return-to-player (RTP) rate of 95.06%.\n\nPaylines and Betting Options\n\nEgyptian Experience has ten paylines, which can be adjusted, allowing you to bet as low as 0.10 credits per spin. Coin values range from 0.01 to 1, so you can also choose how much to bet per line. The maximum bet with real money is 100 credits per spin.\n\nValue of Symbols Including Wilds\n\nThere are playing card symbols ranging from 9 to Ace, decorated with hieroglyphs, as well as thematic symbols including camels, boats, pharaoh statues, and the Sphinx. The wild symbol is the mask of Tutankhamun, which doubles all wins when it substitutes. The wild symbol also delivers the biggest payout of 9,000x your bet line when you land five of them on a payline.\n\nSpecial Features Including Free Spins and Gambling Mode\n\nEgyptian Experience offers a Free Spins mode, which is triggered by landing three or more ankh hieroglyph symbols. You'll get 15 free games, and all wins are multiplied by 3x. You can re-trigger the feature by landing three or more ankh symbols. After each winning spin, you can activate the gambling feature to double your win by guessing the color of the next card.\n\nTheme and Visual Design\n\nEgyptian Experience has an ancient Egypt theme, with symbols against a backdrop of papyrus paper. Each reel has a blue and gold frame resembling the famous funerary mask of Tutankhamun. The symbols of playing cards are carved in limestone, while thematic symbols include camels, boats, pharaoh statues, and the Sphinx. Overall, the graphics are decent, transporting you back in time, but the sound effects could be better.\n\nPotential for Big Wins\n\nThe biggest payout in Egyptian Experience is 9,000x your bet line, which you can win by landing five wild symbols. The Free Spins feature also offers great potential for big wins, with all wins multiplied by 3x.\n\nOverall Probability and Return-to-Player Rate\n\nEgyptian Experience has an RTP of 95.06% and is probably a medium volatility online slot. While the RTP is decent, the game doesn't offer much in terms of special features and big payouts compared to some other online slots with an ancient Egypt theme.\n\n        \n            ",

Delve into one of the world's oldest civilizations and uncover its secrets in Egyptian Experience, the slot machine produced by Novomatic. \n\nThis online slot with five reels and three rows takes you on a journey through pyramid mazes full of treasures from ancient Egypt. Playable from just 0.10 credits per spin, the game offers wins on 10 paylines, with the chance to win up to 9,000x your bet line by matching symbols on reels that look like they're covered in papyrus paper.\n\nThe mask of Tutankhamun's death is the wild symbol, which doubles all wins when it substitutes. You can unlock even more treasures by entering the Free Spins mode, where all wins are multiplied by 3x. And if you're feeling bold, you can enter the gambling mode for the chance to double your wins.\n\nThe graphics of Egyptian Experience transport you back in time to ancient Egypt, with all the symbols appearing against a backdrop of papyrus paper. Each of the five reels is adorned with a blue and gold frame reminiscent of the famous funerary mask of Tutankhamun.\n\nThe symbols of the playing cards, ranging from 9 to Ace, are carved in limestone. You'll also see camels, boats, pharaoh statues, and the Great Sphinx of Giza during your journey through ancient Egypt. The funerary mask of King Tutankhamun pays the most as the wild symbol, delivering wins up to 9,000x your bet line.\n\nUnfortunately, the sound effects do not immerse you in the theme. They're the same stock sounds you'll be used to hearing if you've played online slots developed by Novomatic in the past.\n\nYou can adjust the 10 paylines when you play Egyptian Experience online. However, with such a generous selection of betting options, why risk losing any wins?\n\nCoin values of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50, and 1 are available. This means you can explore treasure-filled pyramids for as little as 0.10 credits per spin. Have deeper pockets? Then you might be interested in betting up to 100 credits when playing with real money in an online casino.\n\nOur review of the Egyptian Experience slot machine reveals a return-to-player (RTP) of 95.06%. While the Austrian gambling giant has no idea how volatile it is, our experts agreed that it's probably a medium volatility online slot. It certainly played that way when we put it to the test.\n\nYou may have noticed that the ankh is one of the most common hieroglyphic symbols when playing online slots with an ancient Egyptian theme. Therefore, you shouldn't be surprised to see it as the scatter symbol when spinning the reels of the Egyptian Experience slot machine.\n\nWins of 2x, 5x, 20x, or 500x are awarded for finding two, three, four, or five scatter symbols, respectively. Three or more ankh hieroglyph symbols result in pharaoh's rewards, granting you 15 free games. Not only is it possible to trigger the feature again, but all accumulated wins are generously multiplied by 3x.\n\nThe Egyptian Experience online slot machine also allows you to gamble after each winning spin. If you choose to activate the gambling feature, simply guess whether the next card will be red or black. Your win is doubled when you guess correctly, while the pharaohs take your win when you're wrong.\n\nEgyptian Experience may not be the best Egyptian-themed slot we've ever reviewed, but it's far from the worst. Although it looks ancient, the winning animations are surprisingly good. We particularly enjoyed watching the worker chipping away at the limestone to build a pyramid.\n\nThe wild symbols that pay out up to 9,000x your bet line and the free games mode with all wins tripled are the main reasons to play the Egyptian Experience online slot.\n\nOther similar slot machines include A While on the Nile by NextGen Gaming, which offers 50 paylines and rewards fit for a pharaoh for matching symbols such as beetles and pyramids. It also boasts NextGen's SuperBet feature, as well as a pick'em game and free spins. Alternatively, you could join Rich Wilde in the popular Play'n GO slot Book of Dead. Like Egyptian Experience, this free slot allows you to spin the reels for just 0.10 credits. Find three or more golden books to spin the reels for free with a special expansion symbol for the chance to win up to 5,000x your bet.\n            ",
