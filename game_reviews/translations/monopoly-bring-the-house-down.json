Monopoly Bring the House Down is one of these, and just like its sister slots, faithfully reproduces the characters and style of the well-known board game.\n\nJust as Hasbro's Monopoly has stood the test of time as an enduring favorite among players of all ages, Barcrest has sought to make their Monopoly slot machines unforgettable. While they can be cute and have a fairly intuitive and entertaining gameplay, it is also true that big winnings are obtained by investing considerable sums of money that not everyone is willing to spend.\n\nGameplay, betting range, RTP\n\nMonopoly Bring the House Down is a fairly linear slot machine, featuring 5 reels, 40 paylines, and an easy and intuitive gameplay, made more interesting by the presence of special features and bonus games.\n\nWhat stands out the most and could represent a weakness of this slot machine, in our opinion, is the maximum bet per spin of €500. Betting such a high amount in a single spin is certainly enticing, as it offers the possibility of taking home truly significant amounts of money.
