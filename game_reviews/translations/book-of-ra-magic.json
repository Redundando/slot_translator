Dal titolo originale sono passati infatti anni e con il tempo sono state proposte varianti e versioni migliorate del titolo.\nBook of Ra Magic è una di queste e oggi andremo a vedere velocemente cosa ha da offrirci questa slot.\n\nBook of Ra Magic: il comparto visivo\nSi comincia, come nostra consuetudine, dall’aspetto più immediato che colpisce l’attenzione dei nuovi giocatori: quello grafico. Book of Ra Magic dimostra di aver giovato di un investimento sotto questo punto di vista, con una grafica migliorata sia per quanto riguarda l’interfaccia di gioco, sia per i simboli che vanno ad affollarne la griglia.\nCome per altri titoli della serie, anche in questo caso notiamo una cura migliorata nei dettagli, come nelle lettere delle carte da gioco (A, K, Q, J e 10) che sono state rielaborate in chiave di geroglifici, così da non stonare nel tema della slot stessa.\n\nBook of Ra Magic: le meccaniche di gioco\nDa un punto di vista prettamente tecnico, ci troviamo di fronte e una slot molto tradizionale e in linea con gli standard dei titoli casino online aams. Infatti possiamo contare i classici cinque rulli e tre linee orizzontali che permettono di avere quindici simboli a ogni giocata. Le linee di vincita sono 10, come in Book of Ra Deluxe.\nCome nelle sue gemelle, anche in questo caso il libro di Ra ricopre sia il ruolo di simbolo Wild che di Scatter. Nel primo caso è un jolly che può sostituire tutti gli altri simboli e ci permette così di ottenere molte combinazioni anche in assenza dei simboli necessari. Nel secondo caso ci permette di accedere alla Feature Mode, ovvero una modalità a giri gratuiti in cui ci vengono dati 10 giri gratis con un simbolo in espansione.\nIn questo caso il simbolo, se coinvolto in una o più combinazioni, si andrà ad espandere lungo tutto il rullo dando così la possibilità di ottenere ulteriori combinazioni. Inoltre è possibile innescare nuovamente la modalità bonus trovando il libro più volte e ricevendo ulteriori giri gratuiti.\nInsomma, un titolo che non può mancare nel repertorio degli amanti di questa sega, per le funzioni migliorate ma la tradizione rispettata.\n\nSlot simili a Book of Ra Magic\nParlando di titoli affini a questa slot, sicuramente ci troviamo ad elencare le varie slot del catalogo Novomatic, da Book of Ra e Book of Ra Deluxe, arrivando a Book of Ra 6.\nAltri titoli che sfruttano la meccanica dell’antico Egitto sono molteplici, come ad esempio: Queen of Gold della Pragmatic Play, Pharaoh’s Treasure della Ash Gaming o ancora Sonnenkafer della Merkur.\nQuesta non è che la punta dell’iceberg, dato che stiamo parlando di uno dei temi più comuni nelle slot machine online che può contare decine se non centinaia di titoli ad esso dedicati.\n\n\nDomande più frequenti - Book of Ra Magic \nDove posso giocare gratuitamente a Book of Ra Magic?\n\nSu SlotJava si può provare la versione gratuita di Book of Ra Magic e di tantissime altre slot senza aver bisogno di creare un conto gioco e depositare dei soli, e neanche di registrarsi o scaricare un software.\n\n\n\nPosso giocare a Book of Ra Magic con soldi veri?\n\nCerto, basterà collegarsi a un casinò online come Starcasinò o Starvegas. È importante scegliere solo casinò forniti di licenza rilasciata dall’ADM, gli unici sicuri al 100%. Per farti un’idea su quali siano i casinò migliori in circolazione, ti consigliamo di dare un’occhiata alle nostre guide presenti su SlotJava.\n\n\n\nPosso ottenere dei bonus senza deposito e giri gratuiti per giocare a Book of Ra Magic?\n\nSì, basterà collegarsi a una delle tante siti che offrono ai propri clienti la possibilità di usufruire di bonus senza deposito e di giri gratuiti, così da poter provare il gioco senza dover investire del denaro reale.

Since the original title, years have passed and over time, improved versions and variations of the title have been proposed.\nBook of Ra Magic is one of these, and today we will quickly see what this slot has to offer us.\n\nBook of Ra Magic: the visual component\n\nAs usual, we start with the most immediate aspect that catches the attention of new players: the graphics. Book of Ra Magic demonstrates to have benefited from an investment in this respect, with improved graphics both in terms of the game interface and in the symbols that populate the grid.\nAs with other titles in the series, we note an improved attention to detail, as seen in the lettering of the playing cards (A, K, Q, J and 10) which have been reworked in the form of hieroglyphics, so as not to clash with the theme of the slot itself.\n\nBook of Ra Magic: game mechanics\n\nFrom a strictly technical point of view, we are facing a very traditional slot in line with the standards of the AAMS online casino titles. In fact, we can count on the classic five reels and three horizontal lines which allow for fifteen symbols per play. There are 10 paylines, as in Book of Ra Deluxe.\nAs in its sister slots, in this case, the Book of Ra symbol covers both the role of the Wild symbol and the Scatter symbol. In the first case, it is a wild card that can replace all other symbols and allows us to obtain many combinations even in the absence of the necessary symbols. In the second case, it allows us to access the Feature Mode, which is a free spin mode where we are given 10 free spins with an expanding symbol.\nIn this case, the symbol, if involved in one or more combinations, will expand along the entire reel, thus giving the possibility of obtaining additional combinations. Additionally, it is possible to trigger the bonus mode again by finding the book several times and receiving additional free spins.\nIn short, a title that cannot be missing from the repertoire of lovers of this genre, for its improved features, but with respect for tradition.\n\nSimilar slots to Book of Ra Magic\n\nSpeaking of titles that are similar to this slot, we can certainly list the various slots in the Novomatic catalog, from Book of Ra and Book of Ra Deluxe, to Book of Ra 6.\nOther titles that exploit the mechanics of ancient Egypt are numerous, such as: Queen of Gold by Pragmatic Play, Pharaoh's Treasure by Ash Gaming, or even Sonnenkafer by Merkur.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg, given that we are talking about one of the most common themes in online slot machines, which can count dozens, if not hundreds of titles dedicated to it.\n\n\nFAQs - Book of Ra Magic\nWhere can I play Book of Ra Magic for free?\n\nOn SlotJava you can try the free version of Book of Ra Magic and many other slots without needing to create a gaming account or deposit any money, nor even register or download software.\n\n\nCan I play Book of Ra Magic with real money?\n\nCertainly, just connect to an online casino like Starcasinò or Starvegas. It is essential to choose only casinos supplied with a license issued by ADM, the only ones that are 100% secure.

Years have passed since the original title, and with time, variants and improved versions of the title have been proposed.\nBook of Ra Magic is one of these, and today we will quickly see what this slot has to offer.\n\nBook of Ra Magic: the visual aspect\nAs usual, we start with the most immediate aspect that catches the attention of new players: the graphic. Book of Ra Magic shows to have benefited from an investment from this point of view, with improved graphics both regarding the game interface and for the symbols that populate the grid.\nAs with other titles in the series, in this case, we also notice an improved attention to detail, such as the lettering on the playing cards (A, K, Q, J and 10), which have been re-elaborated into hieroglyphs, so as not to clash with the slot's theme itself.\n\nBook of Ra Magic: gameplay mechanics\nFrom a purely technical point of view, we find ourselves facing a very traditional slot, in line with the standards of online casino titles in Italy. In fact, we can count on the classic five reels and three horizontal lines that allow fifteen symbols for each play. The paylines are 10, as in Book of Ra Deluxe.\nAs with its siblings, in this case, the Book of Ra covers both the role of the Wild symbol and the Scatter symbol. In the first case, it's a wildcard that can replace all other symbols, allowing us to obtain many combinations even in the absence of the necessary symbols. In the second case, it allows us to access the Feature Mode, a free spin mode where we are given 10 free spins with an expanding symbol.\nIn this case, the symbol, if involved in one or more combinations, will expand along the entire reel, thus giving the possibility of obtaining further combinations.

Years have passed since the original title, and with time, variants and improved versions of the title have been proposed.\nBook of Ra Magic is one of these, and today we will quickly see what this slot has to offer.\n\nBook of Ra Magic: the visual aspect\nAs usual, we start with the most immediate aspect that catches the attention of new players: the graphic. Book of Ra Magic shows to have benefited from an investment from this point of view, with improved graphics both regarding the game interface and for the symbols that populate the grid.\nAs with other titles in the series, in this case, we also notice an improved attention to detail, such as the lettering on the playing cards (A, K, Q, J and 10), which have been re-elaborated into hieroglyphs, so as not to clash with the slot's theme itself.\n\nBook of Ra Magic: gameplay mechanics\nFrom a purely technical point of view, we find ourselves facing a very traditional slot, in line with the standards of online casino titles in Italy. In fact, we can count on the classic five reels and three horizontal lines that allow fifteen symbols for each play. The paylines are 10, as in Book of Ra Deluxe.\nAs with its siblings, in this case, the Book of Ra covers both the role of the Wild symbol and the Scatter symbol. In the first case, it's a wildcard that can replace all other symbols, allowing us to obtain many combinations even in the absence of the necessary symbols. In the second case, it allows us to access the Feature Mode, a free spin mode where we are given 10 free spins with an expanding symbol.\nIn this case, the symbol, if involved in one or more combinations, will expand along the entire reel, thus giving the possibility of obtaining further combinations. Moreover, it's possible to trigger the bonus mode again by finding the book multiple times and receiving additional free spins.\nIn short, it's a title that can't be missing from the repertoire of lovers of this series for the improved features and the respected tradition.\n\nSimilar slots to Book of Ra Magic\nSpeaking of titles similar to this slot, we are certainly listing the various slots in the Novomatic catalog, from Book of Ra and Book of Ra Deluxe, to Book of Ra 6.\nVarious other titles that exploit the mechanic of ancient Egypt are also available, such as: Queen of Gold by Pragmatic Play, Pharaoh's Treasure by Ash Gaming, or even Sonnenkafer by Merkur.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg since we're talking about one of the most common themes in online slot machines, which can count on dozens if not hundreds of titles dedicated to it.\n\nFAQs - Book of Ra Magic\nWhere can I play Book of Ra Magic for free?\nOn SlotJava, you can try the free version of Book of Ra Magic and many other slots without needing to create a gaming account and depositing any money, nor registering or downloading any software.\n\nCan I play Book of Ra Magic for real money?\nOf course, simply connect to an online casino such as Starcasinò or Starvegas.

Years have passed since the original title, and with time, variants and improved versions of the title have been proposed.\nBook of Ra Magic is one of these, and today we will quickly see what this slot has to offer.\n\nBook of Ra Magic: the visual aspect\nAs usual, we start with the most immediate aspect that catches the attention of new players: the graphic. Book of Ra Magic shows to have benefited from an investment from this point of view, with improved graphics both regarding the game interface and for the symbols that populate the grid.\nAs with other titles in the series, in this case, we also notice an improved attention to detail, such as the lettering on the playing cards (A, K, Q, J and 10), which have been re-elaborated into hieroglyphs, so as not to clash with the slot's theme itself.\n\nBook of Ra Magic: gameplay mechanics\nFrom a purely technical point of view, we find ourselves facing a very traditional slot, in line with the standards of online casino titles in Italy. In fact, we can count on the classic five reels and three horizontal lines that allow fifteen symbols for each play. The paylines are 10, as in Book of Ra Deluxe.\nAs with its siblings, in this case, the Book of Ra covers both the role of the Wild symbol and the Scatter symbol. In the first case, it's a wildcard that can replace all other symbols, allowing us to obtain many combinations even in the absence of the necessary symbols. In the second case, it allows us to access the Feature Mode, a free spin mode where we are given 10 free spins with an expanding symbol.\nIn this case, the symbol, if involved in one or more combinations, will expand along the entire reel, thus giving the possibility of obtaining further combinations. Moreover, it's possible to trigger the bonus mode again by finding the book multiple times and receiving additional free spins.\nIn short, it's a title that can't be missing from the repertoire of lovers of this series for the improved features and the respected tradition.\n\nSimilar slots to Book of Ra Magic\nSpeaking of titles similar to this slot, we are certainly listing the various slots in the Novomatic catalog, from Book of Ra and Book of Ra Deluxe, to Book of Ra 6.\nVarious other titles that exploit the mechanic of ancient Egypt are also available, such as: Queen of Gold by Pragmatic Play, Pharaoh's Treasure by Ash Gaming, or even Sonnenkafer by Merkur.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg since we're talking about one of the most common themes in online slot machines, which can count on dozens if not hundreds of titles dedicated to it.\n\nFAQs - Book of Ra Magic\nWhere can I play Book of Ra Magic for free?\nOn SlotJava, you can try the free version of Book of Ra Magic and many other slots without needing to create a gaming account and depositing any money, nor registering or downloading any software.\n\nCan I play Book of Ra Magic for real money?\nOf course, simply connect to an online casino such as Starcasinò or Starvegas.
