The slot also features unique Western letter symbols that resemble Japanese ideograms.\n\nTheme and design\n\nGeisha's Fan has a beautiful Japanese-inspired design that features cherry blossoms, a wooden bridge crossing a river, and an ancient Japanese castle in the distance.

It features a Japanese theme, with symbols and aesthetics that reflect the culture of ancient Japan. The game's highest value symbol is the geisha, and the white fan symbol acts as both the wild and scatter symbol.\n\nTom Horn\n\nTom Horn is a Malta-based online casino game developer that has been making online slots since 2008. They have over 100 games in their portfolio, ranging from classic 3-reel slots to more complex video slots and table games.\n\nJapanese theme and symbols\n\nGeisha's Fan's Japanese theme is evident in its aesthetics and symbols. The game features a beautiful cherry blossom background, with a wooden bridge crossing a river and an ancient Japanese castle in the distance. The symbols on the reels include traditional Japanese objects like bamboo and paper umbrellas, Chinese gold ingots, and the lotus flower. The playing card symbols are also present, but they are represented as Western letters stylized to look like Japanese ideograms.\n\nGameplay features\n\nGeisha's Fan's gameplay is typical of online slots, with a 5x3 grid and 9 pay lines. However, the game does feature a unique expanding symbol feature during its free spin mode. When activated, a symbol is chosen to expand and cover the entire reel where it appears. This can lead to higher value winnings for lucky players. The white fan symbol acts as both the scatter and wild symbol, helping players create more winning combinations. Geisha's Fan promises to offer greater control over a player's gaming account, thanks to its limited number of pay lines. \n\nComparison to other Eastern-themed slots\n\nThere are many other online slots that feature an Eastern theme like Geisha's Fan. Some examples include Dragon Dance, Emperor of the Sea, and Aristocrat's Geisha. Eastern Emeralds, from Quickspin, is another popular online slot with an Eastern theme and similar gameplay features like the expanding symbol and free spin mode. Geisha's Fan's unique feature is its stylized Western letter playing card symbols, which add a touch of individuality to the game.\n\n        \n            ",

In perfect harmony with the setting, the symbols refer to objects of Eastern culture. Such as the traditional bamboo and paper umbrella, Chinese gold ingots, and the lotus flower. The beautiful enigmatic face of the geisha represents the symbol with the highest value, while her white fan represents both the SCATTER and WILD symbols.\n\nIn addition to these, we will also find the symbols of playing cards. As often happens in other slots, these symbols are simply represented with their initials (A, K, Q, J and 10) and the fonts are often too bare.\n\nIn Geisha's Fan, however, the symbols are Western letters but reminiscent of the Japanese ideograms. Thus making them unique and very special. Perhaps also a little less immediate, but it takes little to get used to and recognize them.\n\nThe music that accompanies the slot is typically Eastern, perhaps more Chinese than Japanese, but despite this, it is pleasant to listen to.\n\nBut let's move on immediately to the technical part of this beautiful slot.\n\nGeisha's Fan - Charm made into a slot\nWith its Japanese style and other oriental contaminations, Geisha's Fan fails to break free from the canons dictated by online slots.\n\nWhat we are facing, in fact, is the typical 5x3 type slot that differs from other online titles only for the reduced number of winning lines which are 9. This value, which pales in comparison to the thousands of lines that some slots boast of having, promises instead to obtain higher value winnings and thus have greater control over your gaming account.\n\nInside the game grid, we find a special symbol, namely the fan that gives its name to the same slot. This symbol performs the dual function of WILD and SCATTER symbol by covering the function of a wild card to obtain more winning combinations and to access the free spins.\n\nAt the beginning of this function, a symbol will be chosen which will obtain the characteristic of expanding on the entire reel where it is located. The value that this function can reach, therefore, will depend largely on the symbol that is thus obtained.\n\nSimilar slots to Geisha Fan\nThe Japanese and Eastern world, by extension, have a large number of slots on their side. Just to mention some: Dragon Dance, Emperor of the Sea, Aristocrat's Geisha, and Eastern Emeralds.\n            ",

In perfect harmony with the setting, the symbols refer to objects of Eastern culture. Such as the traditional bamboo and paper umbrella, Chinese gold ingots, and the lotus flower. The beautiful enigmatic face of the geisha represents the symbol with the highest value, while her white fan represents both the SCATTER and WILD symbols.\n\nIn addition to these, we will also find the symbols of playing cards. As often happens in other slots, these symbols are simply represented with their initials (A, K, Q, J and 10) and the fonts are often too bare.\n\nIn Geisha's Fan, however, the symbols are Western letters but reminiscent of the Japanese ideograms. Thus making them unique and very special. Perhaps also a little less immediate, but it takes little to get used to and recognize them.\n\nThe music that accompanies the slot is typically Eastern, perhaps more Chinese than Japanese, but despite this, it is pleasant to listen to.\n\nBut let's move on immediately to the technical part of this beautiful slot.\n\nGeisha's Fan - Charm made into a slot\nWith its Japanese style and other oriental contaminations, Geisha's Fan fails to break free from the canons dictated by online slots.\n\nWhat we are facing, in fact, is the typical 5x3 type slot that differs from other online titles only for the reduced number of winning lines which are 9. This value, which pales in comparison to the thousands of lines that some slots boast of having, promises instead to obtain higher value winnings and thus have greater control over your gaming account.\n\nInside the game grid, we find a special symbol, namely the fan that gives its name to the same slot. This symbol performs the dual function of WILD and SCATTER symbol by covering the function of a wild card to obtain more winning combinations and to access the free spins.\n\nAt the beginning of this function, a symbol will be chosen which will obtain the characteristic of expanding on the entire reel where it is located. The value that this function can reach, therefore, will depend largely on the symbol that is thus obtained.\n\nSimilar slots to Geisha Fan\nThe Japanese and Eastern world, by extension, have a large number of slots on their side. Just to mention some: Dragon Dance, Emperor of the Sea, Aristocrat's Geisha, and Eastern Emeralds.\n            ",
