E’ davvero impossibile immaginarlo, perché questa tematica ha saputo regalarci grandi emozioni negli anni. Una delle proposte più riuscite è sicuramente quella di Age of the Gods Fate Sisters, firmata da Playtech che ha voluto sorprendere i giocatori con un jackpot progressivo che fa sempre gola a chiunque. Abbiamo una struttura di 5 rulli e 25 linee di pagamento sulle quali si posizionano tre figure femminili particolari, pronte a influenzare il destino del gamer. Lo faranno attraverso vincite, giri gratuiti, una funzione di re-spin che incontriamo sul gioco base e una strepitosa funzionalità Portal Free Games di Fates dove possono essere offerti moltiplicatori fino a 5x e Wild fissi.

E’ la storia stessa a colpire con effetti speciali: racconta le avventure di tre sorelle, note al mondo come le tre Parche: Cloto, Lachesi e Atropo. La prima era colei che filava il filo della vita. La seconda lo avvolgeva sul fuso e decideva quanto filo spettasse a ogni persona. E infine la terza è quella che, con le cesoie, lo tagliava andando così a porre fine alla vita di una persona.\nPer rendere accattivante tutto questo sono state presentate diverse funzionalità bonus, come la Sisters’ Gift che si attiva quando vedi le tre protagoniste posizionarsi contemporaneamente sui rulli 1, 3, 5. Resteranno fisse nelle loro posizioni e pagheranno come uno Scatter. Ma questa non è la miglior funzione in assoluto: sei pronto a provare Portal Free Games di Fates? Consiste nell’offerta di giri gratuiti che possono vivacizzare l’esperienza del giocatore. \n 1. Atropo: offre 15 giri gratuiti e moltiplicatore dinamico da 2x a 5x. Se la figura di Atropo appare su uno dei rulli il moltiplicatore aumenta di uno rispettando però il range massimo che abbiamo appena presentato.\n2. Lachesis: si hanno 10 giri gratuiti e Wild fissi che si bloccano per i 3 spin gratis seguenti. Nel caso in cui i Wild si fermino su uno già fisso, si resetterà la sua posizione.\n3.

It's impossible to imagine, because this theme has given us great emotions over the years. One of the most successful proposals is certainly Age of the Gods Fate Sisters, signed by Playtech who wanted to surprise players with a progressive jackpot that always appeals to everyone. We have a structure of 5 reels and 25 paylines on which three particular female figures are positioned, ready to influence the fate of the gamer. They will do so through winnings, free spins, a re-spin feature that we encounter on the base game and a sensational Portal Free Games of Fates functionality where multipliers up to 5x and fixed Wilds can be offered. Let's discover then how Fate can influence not only the story of the slot, but also your lucky winnings.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nLet's start with the graphics, on which there is little to say: the background and symbols that we can admire on the game grid are well thought out and made with care in detail. It is the story itself that impresses with special effects: it tells the adventures of three sisters, known to the world as the three Fates: Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos. The first was the one who spun the thread of life. The second wound it on the spindle and decided how much thread was to be allotted to each person. And finally, the third is the one who, with scissors, cut it, thus putting an end to a person's life.\n\nTo make all this attractive, several bonus features have been presented, such as the Sisters' Gift, which is activated when you see the three protagonists simultaneously positioned on reels 1, 3, 5. They will remain fixed in their positions and pay as a Scatter. But this is not the best function: are you ready to try Portal Free Games of Fates? It consists of the offer of free spins that can liven up the player's experience.\n\n1. Atropos: offers 15 free spins and a dynamic multiplier from 2x to 5x. If the figure of Atropos appears on one of the reels, the multiplier increases by one, but respecting the maximum range that we have just presented.\n\n2. Lachesis: there are 10 free spins and fixed Wilds that are locked for the next 3 free spins. In case the Wilds stop on one already fixed, their position will be reset.\n\n3. Clotho: starts with 8 free spins and random Jokers. 3 random Jokers are added for each free spin.\n\nFinal considerations on the slot Age of the Gods Fate Sisters\n\nAge of the Gods Fate Sisters is definitely a fantastic slot for the functions it offers, capable of worthily representing the entire gaming experience. The idea is not bad, the graphic project is well made, but the maximum care in the bonus games will definitely surprise every type of player.\n\nLet's not forget the 4 progressive jackpots to be won, directly influenced by the higher or lower value of the bet. You can play a random game where to look for 3 identical symbols relating to the Power, Extra Power, Super Power or Ultimate Power jackpot.\n            ",

It's impossible to imagine, because this theme has given us great emotions over the years. One of the most successful proposals is certainly Age of the Gods Fate Sisters, signed by Playtech who wanted to surprise players with a progressive jackpot that always appeals to everyone. We have a structure of 5 reels and 25 paylines on which three particular female figures are positioned, ready to influence the fate of the gamer. They will do so through winnings, free spins, a re-spin feature that we encounter on the base game and a sensational Portal Free Games of Fates functionality where multipliers up to 5x and fixed Wilds can be offered. Let's discover then how Fate can influence not only the story of the slot, but also your lucky winnings.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nLet's start with the graphics, on which there is little to say: the background and symbols that we can admire on the game grid are well thought out and made with care in detail. It is the story itself that impresses with special effects: it tells the adventures of three sisters, known to the world as the three Fates: Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos. The first was the one who spun the thread of life. The second wound it on the spindle and decided how much thread was to be allotted to each person. And finally, the third is the one who, with scissors, cut it, thus putting an end to a person's life.\n\nTo make all this attractive, several bonus features have been presented, such as the Sisters' Gift, which is activated when you see the three protagonists simultaneously positioned on reels 1, 3, 5. They will remain fixed in their positions and pay as a Scatter. But this is not the best function: are you ready to try Portal Free Games of Fates? It consists of the offer of free spins that can liven up the player's experience.\n\n1. Atropos: offers 15 free spins and a dynamic multiplier from 2x to 5x. If the figure of Atropos appears on one of the reels, the multiplier increases by one, but respecting the maximum range that we have just presented.\n\n2. Lachesis: there are 10 free spins and fixed Wilds that are locked for the next 3 free spins. In case the Wilds stop on one already fixed, their position will be reset.\n\n3. Clotho: starts with 8 free spins and random Jokers. 3 random Jokers are added for each free spin.\n\nFinal considerations on the slot Age of the Gods Fate Sisters\n\nAge of the Gods Fate Sisters is definitely a fantastic slot for the functions it offers, capable of worthily representing the entire gaming experience. The idea is not bad, the graphic project is well made, but the maximum care in the bonus games will definitely surprise every type of player.\n\nLet's not forget the 4 progressive jackpots to be won, directly influenced by the higher or lower value of the bet. You can play a random game where to look for 3 identical symbols relating to the Power, Extra Power, Super Power or Ultimate Power jackpot.\n            ",
