            "response": "Step into the woods today and you're in for a surprise, as Little Red Riding Hood has grown up! The Miss Red video slot is based on the classic tale of a girl in a red cloak making her way through the woods with a basket of food for her sick grandmother while a big bad wolf lurks nearby, hoping to intercept her and swallow the grandma whole before dressing up like her and swallowing the girl as well.\n\nWith a design more provocative than you might expect from an online slot based on a children's story, you'll likely find yourself drooling over the beautiful Miss Red, all grown up and ready to burst out of her corset. The main symbols in this game include an overtly provocative Red Riding Hood-cum-cover model, the Wolf, the Grandma's House, the Grandma herself and the Hunters.\n\nThe lady in the red is certainly not small anymore, as she appears as charming as a model to make the players drool with envy as she joins the big bad wolf on the reels as a special expanding symbol on later reels. Miss Red is a Ways-Win slot that offers 1024 paylines for symbol combinations from left to right - the structure is called MultiwayXtra, generating payouts for at least three icons in connected positions. If matching symbols land in the same column, the payout amount will be multiplied. The coin value ranges from €1 to €50, setting the table limits at €45 for the minimum bet and €2250 for the maximum bet. The expected payback is calculated at 92 - 96.16%, ranking the slot as a high or medium variance game.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nBig Bad Wolf and Miss Red are both expanding Wilds - all icons that are positioned between the Big Bad Wolf will also transform into Wolf. The rule does not apply to Miss Red and if this icon is one of the symbols between the two Wolves, a double icon will be formed, combining both icons into one. The same goes for icons that land on the reel positions between the two Miss Red symbols; all except the Wolf will become Miss Red, while the Wolf will become part of the Wolf-Red Riding Hood icon. This hybrid will then behave like a Wild, substituting both symbols separately and potentially transforming other icons.\n\nIf a symbol that is already part of a payable combination is transformed, the payouts will be combined. Even the bonus icon that triggers free spins can be transformed, which will not affect the activation of free spins.\n\nThis game has coin values ranging from 1.00 to 50 coins, with a total bet of up to 2,250 coins. The MultiWay Xtra wins the same symbol in any position in adjacent columns. Having the same symbol in the same column multiplies the win. MultiWay Xtra wins pay from right to left, left to right, and the center 3 reels.\n\nGranny's House will start the free spin round and the number of initial spins will be determined by the flower and fruit basket that the player will randomly choose. The feature can be reactivated by the same combination of Bonus symbols, with the possibility of winning 280 spins in total.\n\nOther symbols you'll see while playing this free Miss Red slot game include the grandmother's cottage (which is the Bonus symbol and can only appear on the second, third and fourth reels), the grandmother herself with her greeting of up to 150 coins, a woodsman in the forest who can give you up to 125 coins, you'll receive up to 25 coins for spotting rabbits and squirrels, while up to 15 coins are offered for seeing mushrooms, pine cones and colorful flowers.\n\nThe wolf and Miss Red are both expanding symbols. Any symbol caught between 2 Wolves will automatically be transformed into a wolf, unless it is Miss Red, and in that case the symbol will be transformed into the Wolf-Red Riding Hood Symbol, and the same goes for all symbols caught between 2 Miss Red symbols.\n\nIt is also worth noting that one of the most recent online slots to be released based on the children's story is NetEnt's Fairytale Legends Red Riding Hood, which boasts stunning design and incredible bonus features, so you should also check out our review.",

The coin value starts at €1 and goes up to €50, setting the table limits at €45 for the minimum bet and €2250 for the maximum bet. The expected payback is calculated at 92 - 96.16%, classifying the slot as a high or medium variance game.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols \nBoth Big Bad Wolf and Miss Red are expanding Wilds - all icons that are positioned between Big Bad Wolf will also transform into Wolf. The rule does not apply to Miss Red, and if this icon is one of the symbols between the two Wolves, a double icon will be formed, combining both icons into one. The same applies to icons that land on the reel positions between Miss Red symbols; all except the Wolf will become Miss Red, while the Wolf will become part of the Wolf-Red icon. This hybrid will then behave like a Wild, replacing both symbols separately and potentially transforming other icons.\nIf a symbol that is already part of a payable combination is transformed, the payouts will be combined. The bonus icon that triggers free spins can also be transformed, which will not affect the activation of free spins.\nThis game has coin values ranging from 1.00 to 50 coins, with a total bet of up to 2,250 coins. MultiWay Xtra wins the same symbol in any position on adjacent columns. Having the same symbol in the same column multiplies the win. MultiWay Xtra wins pay from right to left, left to right, and for the center 3 reels.\nGranny's House will start the round of free spins, and the number of initial spins will be determined by the flower and fruit basket that the player will randomly choose. The feature can be reactivated by the same combination of Bonus symbols, with the chance to win 280 spins in total.\nOther symbols you'll see while playing this free Miss Red slot game include Granny's cottage (which is the Bonus symbol and can appear only on the second, third, and fourth reels), Granny herself with her greeting for a maximum of 150 coins, a woodsman in the forest who can give you up to 125 coins, you'll receive up to 25 coins for spotting rabbits and squirrels, while up to 15 coins are on offer for seeing mushrooms, pine cones, and colorful flowers.\nBoth the wolf and Miss Red are expanding symbols. Any symbol caught between 2 wolves will automatically be transformed into a wolf, unless it's Miss Red, and in that case, the symbol will be transformed into the Wolf-Red Symbol, and the same applies to all symbols caught between 2 Miss Red symbols.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIt's also worth noting that one of the latest online slot games to be released based on the children's tale is NetEnt's Fairytale Legends Red Riding Hood, which boasts stunning design and incredible bonus features, so you should also check out our review."

Miss Red video slot is based on the classic fairy tale of a girl in a red cape wandering through the forest with a basket of food for her ailing grandmother, while a big bad wolf lurks nearby, trying to figure out where she's headed so he can devour the grandma then dress up like her and eat the girl too. \nWith a design more provocative than you’d expect from a slot game based on a children's story, you'll find yourself drooling over the beautiful Miss Red, who has grown up and seems ready to burst out of her corset.\nA fairy tale graphic\nHave you ever wondered what an all grown-up, sexy version of Little Red Riding Hood would look like? Neither have we, but IGT has decided to give us the answer to a question that was never asked (at least not publicly) and the developer has released Miss Red, a slot game that should be rated R in every way. \nThe main symbols of this game include an overtly provocative Little Red Riding Hood - grown in a way you could never have predicted - the Wolf, Granny's House, Granny, and the Hunters. \nThe lady in red is certainly no longer small, charming the players like a model as she joins the big bad wolf on the reels as a special expanding symbol, but only on the following reels.\nMiss Red is a Ways-Win slot that offers 1024 pay lines for symbol combinations from left to right - the structure is called MultiwayXtra, generating payouts for at least three icons in connected positions. If matching symbols land in the same column, the win amount will be multiplied. The coin value starts at €1 and goes up to €50, setting the table limits at €45 for the minimum bet and €2250 for the maximum bet. The expected payback is calculated at 92 - 96.16%, classifying the slot as a high or medium variance game.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols \nBoth Big Bad Wolf and Miss Red are expanding Wilds - all icons that are positioned between Big Bad Wolf will also transform into Wolf. The rule does not apply to Miss Red, and if this icon is one of the symbols between the two Wolves, a double icon will be formed, combining both icons into one. The same applies to icons that land on the reel positions between Miss Red symbols; all except the Wolf will become Miss Red, while the Wolf will become part of the Wolf-Red icon. This hybrid will then behave like a Wild, replacing both symbols separately and potentially transforming other icons.\nIf a symbol that is already part of a payable combination is transformed, the payouts will be combined. The bonus icon that triggers free spins can also be transformed, which will not affect the activation of free spins.\nThis game has coin values ranging from 1.00 to 50 coins, with a total bet of up to 2,250 coins. MultiWay Xtra wins the same symbol in any position on adjacent columns. Having the same symbol in the same column multiplies the win. MultiWay Xtra wins pay from right to left, left to right, and for the center 3 reels.\nGranny's House will start the round of free spins, and the number of initial spins will be determined by the flower and fruit basket that the player will randomly choose. The feature can be reactivated by the same combination of Bonus symbols, with the chance to win 280 spins in total.\nOther symbols you'll see while playing this free Miss Red slot game include Granny's cottage (which is the Bonus symbol and can appear only on the second, third, and fourth reels), Granny herself with her greeting for a maximum of 150 coins, a woodsman in the forest who can give you up to 125 coins, you'll receive up to 25 coins for spotting rabbits and squirrels, while up to 15 coins are on offer for seeing mushrooms, pine cones, and colorful flowers.\nBoth the wolf and Miss Red are expanding symbols. Any symbol caught between 2 wolves will automatically be transformed into a wolf, unless it's Miss Red, and in that case, the symbol will be transformed into the Wolf-Red Symbol, and the same applies to all symbols caught between 2 Miss Red symbols.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIt's also worth noting that one of the latest online slot games to be released based on the children's tale is NetEnt's Fairytale Legends Red Riding Hood, which boasts stunning design and incredible bonus features, so you should also check out our review.\n            ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame Overview\nPay Lines and Structure\nWild Symbols\nFree Spins Feature\nCoin Value Range\nTheme and Design\nBonus Features\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Miss Red\nIf you venture into the woods today, you're sure to get a big surprise, as Little Red Riding Hood has grown up! Miss Red video slot is based on the classic fairy tale of a girl in a red cape wandering through the forest with a basket of food for her ailing grandmother, while a big bad wolf lurks nearby, trying to figure out where she's headed so he can devour the grandma then dress up like her and eat the girl too. \nWith a design more provocative than you’d expect from a slot game based on a children's story, you'll find yourself drooling over the beautiful Miss Red, who has grown up and seems ready to burst out of her corset.\nA fairy tale graphic\nHave you ever wondered what an all grown-up, sexy version of Little Red Riding Hood would look like? Neither have we, but IGT has decided to give us the answer to a question that was never asked (at least not publicly) and the developer has released Miss Red, a slot game that should be rated R in every way. \nThe main symbols of this game include an overtly provocative Little Red Riding Hood - grown in a way you could never have predicted - the Wolf, Granny's House, Granny, and the Hunters. \nThe lady in red is certainly no longer small, charming the players like a model as she joins the big bad wolf on the reels as a special expanding symbol, but only on the following reels.\nMiss Red is a Ways-Win slot that offers 1024 pay lines for symbol combinations from left to right - the structure is called MultiwayXtra, generating payouts for at least three icons in connected positions. If matching symbols land in the same column, the win amount will be multiplied. The coin value starts at €1 and goes up to €50, setting the table limits at €45 for the minimum bet and €2250 for the maximum bet. The expected payback is calculated at 92 - 96.16%, classifying the slot as a high or medium variance game.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols \nBoth Big Bad Wolf and Miss Red are expanding Wilds - all icons that are positioned between Big Bad Wolf will also transform into Wolf. The rule does not apply to Miss Red, and if this icon is one of the symbols between the two Wolves, a double icon will be formed, combining both icons into one. The same applies to icons that land on the reel positions between Miss Red symbols; all except the Wolf will become Miss Red, while the Wolf will become part of the Wolf-Red icon. This hybrid will then behave like a Wild, replacing both symbols separately and potentially transforming other icons.\nIf a symbol that is already part of a payable combination is transformed, the payouts will be combined. The bonus icon that triggers free spins can also be transformed, which will not affect the activation of free spins.\nThis game has coin values ranging from 1.00 to 50 coins, with a total bet of up to 2,250 coins. MultiWay Xtra wins the same symbol in any position on adjacent columns. Having the same symbol in the same column multiplies the win. MultiWay Xtra wins pay from right to left, left to right, and for the center 3 reels.\nGranny's House will start the round of free spins, and the number of initial spins will be determined by the flower and fruit basket that the player will randomly choose. The feature can be reactivated by the same combination of Bonus symbols, with the chance to win 280 spins in total.\nOther symbols you'll see while playing this free Miss Red slot game include Granny's cottage (which is the Bonus symbol and can appear only on the second, third, and fourth reels), Granny herself with her greeting for a maximum of 150 coins, a woodsman in the forest who can give you up to 125 coins, you'll receive up to 25 coins for spotting rabbits and squirrels, while up to 15 coins are on offer for seeing mushrooms, pine cones, and colorful flowers.\nBoth the wolf and Miss Red are expanding symbols. Any symbol caught between 2 wolves will automatically be transformed into a wolf, unless it's Miss Red, and in that case, the symbol will be transformed into the Wolf-Red Symbol, and the same applies to all symbols caught between 2 Miss Red symbols.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIt's also worth noting that one of the latest online slot games to be released based on the children's tale is NetEnt's Fairytale Legends Red Riding Hood, which boasts stunning design and incredible bonus features, so you should also check out our review.\n            ",

Developed by IGT, this sloth game boasts 1024 pay lines through the MultiwayXtra winning structure, and it offers bet sizes ranging from €1 to €50. The expected payback is between 92% and 96.16%.\n\nGame design and graphics\n\nThe design of the game is a fairy tale-based, with symbols that include Little Red Riding Hood, Granny's House, Granny herself, and the Big Bad Wolf. IGT went for a sexier, more provocative appeal, and it's worth noting that Miss Red is quite voluptuous and wearing what appears to be a corset. The graphics are top-notch and immersive, creating an authentic forest atmosphere.\n\nPay lines and MultiwayXtra structure\n\nMiss Red has a MultiwayXtra winning structure, which means that players can win from 1024 pay lines. The slot pays out for at least three connected symbols from left to right, and multiplier wins apply to pay lines where symbols land in the same column. A payout of a combination of multiplier wins and connected symbols is possible, delivering medium to a high level of variance.\n\nCoin value and betting options\n\nMiss Red has a betting range of €1 to €50 per coin, and using this range allows for a total bet of up to 2,250 coins. Players have the option to wager on the 1024 pay lines on each spin, and the expected payback varies between 92% and 96.16%.\n\nExpanding Wilds - Wolf and Miss Red\n\nBoth the Big Bad Wolf and Miss Red are expanding wilds. If any symbol is positioned between the two wolves, it will transform into a wolf, but this rule does not apply to Miss Red. Meanwhile, if any symbol is placed between two Miss Red symbols, all icons except the wolf will transform into Miss Red. The hybrid of these two symbols can also potentially replace other symbols as a wild.\n\nFree spins round triggered by Granny's House\n\nThe bonus symbol that triggers the round of free spins is Granny's House, and it only appears on the second, third, and fourth reels. To activate this bonus round, players must land three Bonus symbols. The house symbol awards initial free spins, and the basket icon will determine how many free spins players can get in the round. This bonus round feature can be reactivated through the same bonus combination, potentially enabling players to win up to 280 spins.\n\nOverall gameplay and experience\n\nMiss Red is an immersive slot game with top-quality graphics and sound to fit its fairy tale theme. The MultiwayXtra wins and expanding wilds offer gameplay variety, while the Free Spins with the chance to reactivate the round offers the possibility of prolonging gameplay. However, the sensualized Little Red Riding Hood may not be everyone's cup of tea. NetEnt's Fairytale Legends Red Riding Hood is a recent slot game based on the same story, and it may be worth considering for players who prefer a more traditional approach.\n\n        \n            ",

Developed by IGT, the game features an adult version of Little Red as its main character, a big bad wolf and 4 other symbols, including Granny's House and the Hunters. It is a Ways-Win slot with 1024 pay lines, and its structure is called MultiwayXtra, meaning that payouts are generated for at least three icons in connected positions. The expected payback is calculated at 92 - 96.16%, classifying the slot as a high or medium variance game.\n\nPay Lines and Structure\n\nMiss Red is a Ways-Win slot that offers 1024 pay lines for symbol combinations from left to right - the structure is called MultiwayXtra, generating payouts for at least three icons in connected positions. If matching symbols land in the same column, the win amount will be multiplied. The coin value starts at €1 and goes up to €50, setting the table limits at €45 for the minimum bet and €2250 for the maximum bet. The expected payback is calculated at 92 - 96.16%, classifying the slot as a high or medium variance game.\n\nWild Symbols\n\nBoth the Big Bad Wolf and Miss Red are expanding Wild symbols. All icons that are positioned between the Big Bad Wolf will also transform into Wolf. The rule does not apply to Miss Red, and if this icon is one of the symbols between the two Wolves, a double icon will be formed, combining both icons into one. The same applies to icons that land on the reel positions between Miss Red symbols; all except the Wolf will become Miss Red, while the Wolf will become part of the Wolf-Red icon. This hybrid will then behave like a Wild, replacing both symbols separately and potentially transforming other icons.\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nGranny's House will start the round of free spins, and the number of initial spins will be determined by the flower and fruit basket that the player will randomly choose. The feature can be reactivated by the same combination of Bonus symbols, with the chance to win 280 spins in total.\n\nCoin Value Range\n\nThe coin value starts at €1 and goes up to €50, setting the table limits at €45 for the minimum bet and €2250 for the maximum bet. This game has coin values ranging from 1.00 to 50 coins, with a total bet of up to 2,250 coins.\n\nTheme and Design\n\nMiss Red is a slot game based on the classic fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood. It features an adult version of Little Red as its main character, a big bad wolf, Granny's House, Granny, and the Hunters. The provocative design of Miss Red's character is not what one would expect from a slot game based on a children's story.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe Bonus symbol in Miss Red is Granny's Cottage, and it can appear only on the second, third, and fourth reels. Other symbols in the game include Granny herself with her greeting for a maximum of 150 coins, a woodsman in the forest who can give you up to 125 coins, and various other symbols such as rabbits, squirrels, mushrooms, pine cones, and flowers.\n\n        \n            ",

Miss Red video slot is based on the classic fairy tale of a girl in a red cape wandering through the forest with a basket of food for her ailing grandmother, while a big bad wolf lurks nearby, trying to figure out where she's headed so he can devour the grandma then dress up like her and eat the girl too. \nWith a design more provocative than you’d expect from a slot game based on a children's story, you'll find yourself drooling over the beautiful Miss Red, who has grown up and seems ready to burst out of her corset.\nA fairy tale graphic\nHave you ever wondered what an all grown-up, sexy version of Little Red Riding Hood would look like? Neither have we, but IGT has decided to give us the answer to a question that was never asked (at least not publicly) and the developer has released Miss Red, a slot game that should be rated R in every way. \nThe main symbols of this game include an overtly provocative Little Red Riding Hood - grown in a way you could never have predicted - the Wolf, Granny's House, Granny, and the Hunters. \nThe lady in red is certainly no longer small, charming the players like a model as she joins the big bad wolf on the reels as a special expanding symbol, but only on the following reels.\nMiss Red is a Ways-Win slot that offers 1024 pay lines for symbol combinations from left to right - the structure is called MultiwayXtra, generating payouts for at least three icons in connected positions. If matching symbols land in the same column, the win amount will be multiplied. The coin value starts at €1 and goes up to €50, setting the table limits at €45 for the minimum bet and €2250 for the maximum bet. The expected payback is calculated at 92 - 96.16%, classifying the slot as a high or medium variance game.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols \nBoth Big Bad Wolf and Miss Red are expanding Wilds - all icons that are positioned between Big Bad Wolf will also transform into Wolf. The rule does not apply to Miss Red, and if this icon is one of the symbols between the two Wolves, a double icon will be formed, combining both icons into one. The same applies to icons that land on the reel positions between Miss Red symbols; all except the Wolf will become Miss Red, while the Wolf will become part of the Wolf-Red icon. This hybrid will then behave like a Wild, replacing both symbols separately and potentially transforming other icons.\nIf a symbol that is already part of a payable combination is transformed, the payouts will be combined. The bonus icon that triggers free spins can also be transformed, which will not affect the activation of free spins.\nThis game has coin values ranging from 1.00 to 50 coins, with a total bet of up to 2,250 coins. MultiWay Xtra wins the same symbol in any position on adjacent columns. Having the same symbol in the same column multiplies the win. MultiWay Xtra wins pay from right to left, left to right, and for the center 3 reels.\nGranny's House will start the round of free spins, and the number of initial spins will be determined by the flower and fruit basket that the player will randomly choose. The feature can be reactivated by the same combination of Bonus symbols, with the chance to win 280 spins in total.\nOther symbols you'll see while playing this free Miss Red slot game include Granny's cottage (which is the Bonus symbol and can appear only on the second, third, and fourth reels), Granny herself with her greeting for a maximum of 150 coins, a woodsman in the forest who can give you up to 125 coins, you'll receive up to 25 coins for spotting rabbits and squirrels, while up to 15 coins are on offer for seeing mushrooms, pine cones, and colorful flowers.\nBoth the wolf and Miss Red are expanding symbols. Any symbol caught between 2 wolves will automatically be transformed into a wolf, unless it's Miss Red, and in that case, the symbol will be transformed into the Wolf-Red Symbol, and the same applies to all symbols caught between 2 Miss Red symbols.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIt's also worth noting that one of the latest online slot games to be released based on the children's tale is NetEnt's Fairytale Legends Red Riding Hood, which boasts stunning design and incredible bonus features, so you should also check out our review.\n            ",

Miss Red video slot is based on the classic fairy tale of a girl in a red cape wandering through the forest with a basket of food for her ailing grandmother, while a big bad wolf lurks nearby, trying to figure out where she's headed so he can devour the grandma then dress up like her and eat the girl too. \nWith a design more provocative than you’d expect from a slot game based on a children's story, you'll find yourself drooling over the beautiful Miss Red, who has grown up and seems ready to burst out of her corset.\nA fairy tale graphic\nHave you ever wondered what an all grown-up, sexy version of Little Red Riding Hood would look like? Neither have we, but IGT has decided to give us the answer to a question that was never asked (at least not publicly) and the developer has released Miss Red, a slot game that should be rated R in every way. \nThe main symbols of this game include an overtly provocative Little Red Riding Hood - grown in a way you could never have predicted - the Wolf, Granny's House, Granny, and the Hunters. \nThe lady in red is certainly no longer small, charming the players like a model as she joins the big bad wolf on the reels as a special expanding symbol, but only on the following reels.\nMiss Red is a Ways-Win slot that offers 1024 pay lines for symbol combinations from left to right - the structure is called MultiwayXtra, generating payouts for at least three icons in connected positions. If matching symbols land in the same column, the win amount will be multiplied. The coin value starts at €1 and goes up to €50, setting the table limits at €45 for the minimum bet and €2250 for the maximum bet. The expected payback is calculated at 92 - 96.16%, classifying the slot as a high or medium variance game.\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols \nBoth Big Bad Wolf and Miss Red are expanding Wilds - all icons that are positioned between Big Bad Wolf will also transform into Wolf. The rule does not apply to Miss Red, and if this icon is one of the symbols between the two Wolves, a double icon will be formed, combining both icons into one. The same applies to icons that land on the reel positions between Miss Red symbols; all except the Wolf will become Miss Red, while the Wolf will become part of the Wolf-Red icon. This hybrid will then behave like a Wild, replacing both symbols separately and potentially transforming other icons.\nIf a symbol that is already part of a payable combination is transformed, the payouts will be combined. The bonus icon that triggers free spins can also be transformed, which will not affect the activation of free spins.\nThis game has coin values ranging from 1.00 to 50 coins, with a total bet of up to 2,250 coins. MultiWay Xtra wins the same symbol in any position on adjacent columns. Having the same symbol in the same column multiplies the win. MultiWay Xtra wins pay from right to left, left to right, and for the center 3 reels.\nGranny's House will start the round of free spins, and the number of initial spins will be determined by the flower and fruit basket that the player will randomly choose. The feature can be reactivated by the same combination of Bonus symbols, with the chance to win 280 spins in total.\nOther symbols you'll see while playing this free Miss Red slot game include Granny's cottage (which is the Bonus symbol and can appear only on the second, third, and fourth reels), Granny herself with her greeting for a maximum of 150 coins, a woodsman in the forest who can give you up to 125 coins, you'll receive up to 25 coins for spotting rabbits and squirrels, while up to 15 coins are on offer for seeing mushrooms, pine cones, and colorful flowers.\nBoth the wolf and Miss Red are expanding symbols. Any symbol caught between 2 wolves will automatically be transformed into a wolf, unless it's Miss Red, and in that case, the symbol will be transformed into the Wolf-Red Symbol, and the same applies to all symbols caught between 2 Miss Red symbols.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIt's also worth noting that one of the latest online slot games to be released based on the children's tale is NetEnt's Fairytale Legends Red Riding Hood, which boasts stunning design and incredible bonus features, so you should also check out our review.\n            ",
