The first promising detail is that the game features a wild symbol. The second promising fact is that the wild symbol can be equipped with a multiplier, which, thanks to its multiplications, can lead you to a greater effect on winning results.

Read our review to find out more.\n\nA very strange and curious graphic\n\nThe theme of this game is a collision between the unmistakable American cartoon style of the '20s and '30s and a fruit theme, which is also unmistakably original in the world of slot machines. Briefly or not, both ideas date back to the same historical period, and Play'n GO combinen the two themes, like a hand in a glove.\n\nThe Charlie Chance In Hell To Pay slot has a quirky theme. The caricature on the left has done something to ensure its place on the shores of the Styx. Maybe Charlie Chance is the fantasy detective Charlie Chan from the roaring '20s, or Play'n GO simply loved the name. Whatever it is, they have produced one of the most beautiful and potentially popular three-reel slots of 2020.\n\nThe controls at the bottom of the screen contain everything you need to start the game. The big green Spin button is located in the lower right corner, and immediately next to it is the autoplay button.

Just select one of the blocks containing the bet amount and then press the play button to place the first bet against the Charlie Chance In Hell To Pay slot. The range of available bets starts at just €0.10 per spin and has a maximum of €100.00.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe five paylines are guaranteed by a 3x3 reel-set. The identity of the fruit slot features symbols such as grapes, cherries, lemons, and apples, which form the category of low-cost symbols. The other end of the equation has a medium set of bells, the BAR symbol, and triple six.\n\nIn terms of value, the most profitable symbol is the bells, in other words, a combination of them, composed of three symbols or one or two symbols joined by wild symbols. The bells pay 4x multiplied by the bet. The remaining symbols pay lower amounts.\n\nThe Charlie Chance in Hell to Pay slot has more than one wild symbol, but we'll talk about that later.\n\nA regular wild symbol replaces all symbols on the paytable except the Scatter. The Wild can appear with an additional multiplier value that can be either x2 or x3. The best part of the game is that the multipliers cross each other, thus when more than one wild multiplier lands on the screen, and there is likely to be a winning result, the amount of the win will be increased thanks to a nice booster.\n\nThe game has a free spins feature, but this is just one of the five features that are displayed on the board: guaranteed win; respin with a random number of wilds; respin with x2, x3, or x25 wild multipliers; and a cash prize.\n\nTo trigger the feature board, there must be a result with three scatter symbols, which are represented by the symbol of the beautiful girl.\n\nOne way to play is the autoplay mode. Select the corresponding button and choose one of the buttons that has the automatic spins on it. There are few other options in that menu, such as setting one or more conditions that will stop the spins when some predetermined conditions have been met during the game.\n\nIn the lower-left corner of the screen, there are five buttons that activate or open the sound setting, fast spins, game rules, spin history, and menu.\n\nThis is a moderately volatile game with an RTP of 96.23%, which falls within the average range of typical slot RTPs.

The first promising detail is that the game features a wild symbol. The second promising fact is that the wild symbol can be given a multiplier, and that these multipliers can, thanks to their multiplications, direct you towards a greater effect on winning results. Furthermore, a series of respin features makes the game more exciting, and of course there is a potential winning that we had mentioned at the top.\n\nTravel to the not-so-scary depths of hell for a chance to win 6,666x your bet with some impressive multipliers. Is this diabolical slot worth your money? Read our review to find out more.\n\nA very strange and curious graphics.\n\nThe theme of this game is a clash between the unmistakable American cartoon-style of the 20s and 30s and a fruit theme, in turn unmistakably original in the world of slot machines. Concisely or not, both ideas date back to the same historical period and Play'n GO has made them fit together as a hand in a glove.\n\nThe Charlie Chance In Hell To Pay slot has a bizarre theme. The cartoon on the left has done something to ensure his place on the shores of the Styx. Perhaps Charlie Chance is the fictional detective Charlie Chan of the roaring 20s, or Play'n GO just loved the name. Whatever it is, they have produced one of the most beautiful and potentially popular three-reel slots of 2020.\n\nThe controls at the bottom of the screen contain everything you need to start the game. The big green Spin button is located in the bottom right corner and immediately next to it is the autoplay button. On the left is a window where the current bet amount is displayed and in the opposite corner is the balance amount.\n\nChoosing the bet is done in the blink of an eye. Just select one of the blocks containing the bet amount and then press the play button to make the first bet against the Charlie Chance In Hell To Pay slot. The range of available bets starts from just €0.10 per spin and has a maximum of €100.00.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine.\n\nThe five paylines are guaranteed by a 3x3 reel-set. The identity of the fruit slot carries symbols such as grapes, cherries, lemons, and apples, which comprise the low-cost symbol category. The other end of the equation has a medium set of bells, the BAR symbol, and the triple six.\n\nIn terms of value, the most profitable symbol is the bells, in other words, a combination of them, consisting of three symbols or one or two symbols joined by wild symbols. The bells pay 4x multiplied by the bet. The remaining symbols pay lower amounts.\n\nCharlie Chance in Hell to Pay slot has more than one wild symbol, but we'll tell you more about that later.\n\nA regular Wild symbol replaces all symbols on the paytable, except for the Scatter. The Wild can appear with an additional multiplier value that can be either x2 or x3. The best part of the game is that the multipliers intersect by multiplying, so when more than one wild multiplier lands on the screen, and there is probably a winning result, the amount of the win will be increased thanks to a nice booster.\n\nThe game has a free spins feature, but this is only one of the five features that are displayed on the board: guaranteed win; respin with a random number of wilds; respin with wild multipliers of x2, x3, or x25; and a cash prize.\n\nTo trigger the feature board, there needs to be a result with three scatter symbols, which are represented by the symbol of the beautiful girl.\n\nOne way to play is the autoplay mode.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics and Features:\n\nCharlie Chance in Hell to Pay has five paylines, which enhances the dynamics of the three-reel layout. The game features a regular and multiplier Wild symbol and a series of respin features that make the game more exciting. Additionally, there is a feature board with five features that can be triggered by three scatter symbols, which are represented by the symbol of a girl.\n\nSymbol Design and Their Values:\n\nThe identity of the fruit slot carries symbols such as grapes, cherries, lemons, and apples, which comprise the low-cost symbol category. The other end of the equation has a medium set of bells, the BAR symbol, and the triple six. In terms of value, the most profitable symbol is the bells and the remaining symbols pay lower amounts.\n\nUnique Theme:\n\nThe theme of this game is a clash between the unmistakable American cartoon-style of the 20s and 30s and a fruit theme, in turn, an unmistakably original idea in the world of slot machines.\n\nWild Symbol and Potential for Multipliers:\n\nThe game has a regular Wild symbol that replaces all symbols on the paytable, except for the Scatter. The Wild can appear with an additional multiplier value that can be either x2 or x3. Together, these multipliers have the potential to increase the amount of the win whenever there is a winning combination.\n\nControls and Bet Selection Options:\n\nThe controls at the bottom of the screen contain everything players need to start the game. The big green Spin button is located in the bottom right corner. The autoplay mode is available, and choosing the bet is done in the blink of an eye. The range of available bets starts from just €0.10 per spin and has a maximum of €100.00.\n\nRTP Percentage and Volatility:\n\nIt is a moderately volatile game with an RTP of 96.23%, which falls within the average range of typical slot RTPs. Most players prefer a medium volatility slot as they tend to be less unpredictable.\n\nComparison to Other Similar Slot Games:\n\nBlueprint Gaming's Ted Pub Fruit slots offer a similar pub-style fruit structure, traditional symbols, and classic bonus features. However, Charlie Chance in Hell to Pay stands out with its unique theme that clashes a cartoon-style of the 20s and 30s with a fruit theme, a feature board, and a moderately volatile experience that appeals to most players.\n\n        \n            ",

The first promising detail is that the game features a wild symbol. The second promising fact is that the wild symbol can be given a multiplier, and that these multipliers can, thanks to their multiplications, direct you towards a greater effect on winning results. Furthermore, a series of respin features makes the game more exciting, and of course there is a potential winning that we had mentioned at the top.\n\nTravel to the not-so-scary depths of hell for a chance to win 6,666x your bet with some impressive multipliers. Is this diabolical slot worth your money? Read our review to find out more.\n\nA very strange and curious graphics.\n\nThe theme of this game is a clash between the unmistakable American cartoon-style of the 20s and 30s and a fruit theme, in turn unmistakably original in the world of slot machines. Concisely or not, both ideas date back to the same historical period and Play'n GO has made them fit together as a hand in a glove.\n\nThe Charlie Chance In Hell To Pay slot has a bizarre theme. The cartoon on the left has done something to ensure his place on the shores of the Styx. Perhaps Charlie Chance is the fictional detective Charlie Chan of the roaring 20s, or Play'n GO just loved the name. Whatever it is, they have produced one of the most beautiful and potentially popular three-reel slots of 2020.\n\nThe controls at the bottom of the screen contain everything you need to start the game. The big green Spin button is located in the bottom right corner and immediately next to it is the autoplay button. On the left is a window where the current bet amount is displayed and in the opposite corner is the balance amount.\n\nChoosing the bet is done in the blink of an eye. Just select one of the blocks containing the bet amount and then press the play button to make the first bet against the Charlie Chance In Hell To Pay slot. The range of available bets starts from just €0.10 per spin and has a maximum of €100.00.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine.\n\nThe five paylines are guaranteed by a 3x3 reel-set. The identity of the fruit slot carries symbols such as grapes, cherries, lemons, and apples, which comprise the low-cost symbol category. The other end of the equation has a medium set of bells, the BAR symbol, and the triple six.\n\nIn terms of value, the most profitable symbol is the bells, in other words, a combination of them, consisting of three symbols or one or two symbols joined by wild symbols. The bells pay 4x multiplied by the bet. The remaining symbols pay lower amounts.\n\nCharlie Chance in Hell to Pay slot has more than one wild symbol, but we'll tell you more about that later.\n\nA regular Wild symbol replaces all symbols on the paytable, except for the Scatter. The Wild can appear with an additional multiplier value that can be either x2 or x3. The best part of the game is that the multipliers intersect by multiplying, so when more than one wild multiplier lands on the screen, and there is probably a winning result, the amount of the win will be increased thanks to a nice booster.\n\nThe game has a free spins feature, but this is only one of the five features that are displayed on the board: guaranteed win; respin with a random number of wilds; respin with wild multipliers of x2, x3, or x25; and a cash prize.\n\nTo trigger the feature board, there needs to be a result with three scatter symbols, which are represented by the symbol of the beautiful girl.\n\nOne way to play is the autoplay mode. Select the corresponding button and choose one of the buttons that has automatic spins on it. There are a few other options in that menu, such as setting one or more conditions that will stop the spins when certain predetermined conditions have been met during the game.\n\nIn the lower left corner of the screen, there are five buttons that activate or open the sound setting, fast spins, game rules, spin history, and the menu.\n\nIt is a moderately volatile game with an RTP of 96.23%, which falls within the average range of typical slot RTPs. Most players prefer a medium volatility slot as they tend to be less unpredictable.\n\nOther similar slot machines.\n\nJoin the favorite TV teddy bear, Ted, in Blueprint Gaming's Ted Pub Fruit slots.

The image should feature a happy Maya warrior with glasses, as this symbol appears in the game and adds to its quirky charm. The image should also showcase some of the game's elements, such as the fruit symbols and potential multipliers. The cartoon-style should be bright and colorful, with bold lines and playful details that appeal to both casual and experienced slot players. Overall, the feature image should convey the fun and exciting nature of the game, while also highlighting its unique blend of themes and features."
