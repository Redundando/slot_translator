Il numero di simboli che atterrano sui rulli è diverso per ogni giro. Le bobine incastonate in una cornice decorata includono:\n\nCalici, Scudi, Cavalieri, una Regina e un Re, una misteriosa Donna in viola, uno Standard Reale, Pietre Preziose rosse e blu e un Drago. Il Drago è il simbolo più redditizio in mostra, assegnando 250 monete per una combinazione di 6 simboli;\nIl Giullare femminile è il Wild del gioco: può atterrare completamente impilata e colpire fino a 2 bobine nello stesso giro.

Characterized by a refined design, this 6-reel and 117,649 ways to win (Megaways) game comes with stacked Wild Multipliers and a Bonus Feature that initially awards up to 50 Free Spins! Embark on your mission by betting from 0.20€ up to 40.00€ per spin.\n\nGame Modes and Key Features\nThe first thing you will notice when playing Dragon Born is that the machine uses the Megaways game engine, which offers up to 117,649 ways to win – winning combinations are created by landing the same symbol on adjacent reels. The number of symbols that land on the reels is different for each spin. The reels set in a decorated frame include:\n\nGoblets, Shields, Knights, a Queen and King, a mysterious Lady in Purple, a Royal Standard, Red and Blue Gemstones, and a Dragon. The Dragon is the most profitable symbol on display, awarding 250 coins per 6-symbol combination.\n\nThe female Jester is the Wild of the game: it can land fully stacked and hit up to 2 reels in the same spin. Wins, including the Wild, are also boosted by a multiplier that can exceed 7 times depending on how many symbols appear. If you combine the 2 fully stacked Wild reels, the multiplier can reach 49x!\n\nAlso look for the Diamond symbol, which is the Scatter and the key to unlocking the game's sole feature, the Free Spins Feature – 3, 4, 5, or 6 diamonds landing anywhere on the reels in a single spin will earn you 6, 12, 25, or even 50 free spins.\n\nBoth single and stacked Wilds can hit during the feature: you can also retrigger more free spins if the diamonds land again. There is no limit to the number of times the feature can be retriggered. Each of these Free Spins is played on a complete 7x7 set with 117,649 ways to win, maximizing the chances of landing a winning combination.\n\nMy Final Thoughts: Excellent gameplay and good gaming action\nConsidering the many history/medieval-themed slots already on the market, I had fun with Dragon Born. The animations are incredibly smooth and the images are well-made. The gameplay also convinced me, thanks to a nice mix of base game action with the thrilling Bonus feature. The free slot game Dragon Born Megaways thus becomes an option to consider if you love this kind of plot. Also try it with real money or discover in our selected casinos the other available titles!",

With its exquisite design, this 6-reel and 117,649 ways to win (Megaways) game comes with stacked Wild Multipliers and a Bonus Feature that initially rewards up to 50 Free Spins! Begin your mission by betting from €0.20 up to €40.00 per spin.\n\nGameplay and Main Features\nThe first thing you will notice while playing Dragon Born is that the machine uses a Megaways game engine, which offers a staggering 117,649 ways to win - winning combinations are created by landing the same symbol on adjacent reels. The number of symbols that land on the reels is different for each spin. The reels embedded in a decorated frame include:\n\nGoblets, Shields, Knights, a Queen and a King, a mysterious Lady in purple, a Royal Standard, red and blue Precious Stones, and a Dragon. The Dragon is the most profitable symbol on display, awarding 250 coins for a combination of 6 symbols;\n\nThe female Jester is the Wild of the game: she can land completely stacked and hit up to 2 reels in the same spin. Wins, including the Wild, are also boosted by a multiplier that can go up to 7 times depending on how many symbols appear. If you combine the 2 completely stacked Wild reels, the multiplier can reach 49x!\n\nAlso, look for the Diamond symbol, which is the Scatter and the key to unlocking the only game feature, the Free Spins Function - 3, 4, 5, or 6 diamonds in any position on the reels in a single spin will earn you 6, 12, 25, or even 50 free spins.\n\nBoth single and stacked Wilds can hit during the feature: you can reactivate more free spins if the diamonds land again. There is no limit to the number of times the function can be reactivated. Each of these Free Spins is played on a complete 7x7 set with 117,649 ways to win, maximizing your chances of landing a winning combination.\n\nMy final considerations: excellent gameplay and good gaming action\nConsidering the many historical/medieval-themed slots already on the market, I had a blast with Dragon Born. The animations are incredibly smooth, and the images are well done. The gameplay also convinced me, thanks to a nice mix of basic gaming action with the exciting Bonus feature. The free Dragon Born Megaways slot thus becomes an option to consider if you love this type of storyline. Also, try it with real money or discover in our selected casinos the other titles available!\n            ",

Begin your mission by betting from €0.20 up to €40.00 per spin.\n\nGameplay and Main Features\nThe first thing you will notice while playing Dragon Born is that the machine uses a Megaways game engine, which offers a staggering 117,649 ways to win - winning combinations are created by landing the same symbol on adjacent reels. The number of symbols that land on the reels is different for each spin. The reels embedded in a decorated frame include:\n\nGoblets, Shields, Knights, a Queen and a King, a mysterious Lady in purple, a Royal Standard, red and blue Precious Stones, and a Dragon. The Dragon is the most profitable symbol on display, awarding 250 coins for a combination of 6 symbols;\n\nThe female Jester is the Wild of the game: she can land completely stacked and hit up to 2 reels in the same spin. Wins, including the Wild, are also boosted by a multiplier that can go up to 7 times depending on how many symbols appear. If you combine the 2 completely stacked Wild reels, the multiplier can reach 49x!\n\nAlso, look for the Diamond symbol, which is the Scatter and the key to unlocking the only game feature, the Free Spins Function - 3, 4, 5, or 6 diamonds in any position on the reels in a single spin will earn you 6, 12, 25, or even 50 free spins.\n\nBoth single and stacked Wilds can hit during the feature: you can reactivate more free spins if the diamonds land again.

With its exquisite design, this 6-reel and 117,649 ways to win (Megaways) game comes with stacked Wild Multipliers and a Bonus Feature that initially rewards up to 50 Free Spins! Begin your mission by betting from €0.20 up to €40.00 per spin.\n\nGameplay and Main Features\nThe first thing you will notice while playing Dragon Born is that the machine uses a Megaways game engine, which offers a staggering 117,649 ways to win - winning combinations are created by landing the same symbol on adjacent reels. The number of symbols that land on the reels is different for each spin. The reels embedded in a decorated frame include:\n\nGoblets, Shields, Knights, a Queen and a King, a mysterious Lady in purple, a Royal Standard, red and blue Precious Stones, and a Dragon. The Dragon is the most profitable symbol on display, awarding 250 coins for a combination of 6 symbols;\n\nThe female Jester is the Wild of the game: she can land completely stacked and hit up to 2 reels in the same spin. Wins, including the Wild, are also boosted by a multiplier that can go up to 7 times depending on how many symbols appear. If you combine the 2 completely stacked Wild reels, the multiplier can reach 49x!\n\nAlso, look for the Diamond symbol, which is the Scatter and the key to unlocking the only game feature, the Free Spins Function - 3, 4, 5, or 6 diamonds in any position on the reels in a single spin will earn you 6, 12, 25, or even 50 free spins.\n\nBoth single and stacked Wilds can hit during the feature: you can reactivate more free spins if the diamonds land again. There is no limit to the number of times the function can be reactivated. Each of these Free Spins is played on a complete 7x7 set with 117,649 ways to win, maximizing your chances of landing a winning combination.\n\nMy final considerations: excellent gameplay and good gaming action\nConsidering the many historical/medieval-themed slots already on the market, I had a blast with Dragon Born. The animations are incredibly smooth, and the images are well done. The gameplay also convinced me, thanks to a nice mix of basic gaming action with the exciting Bonus feature. The free Dragon Born Megaways slot thus becomes an option to consider if you love this type of storyline. Also, try it with real money or discover in our selected casinos the other titles available!\n            ",
