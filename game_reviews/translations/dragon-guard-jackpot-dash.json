However, the mountaintops are also the home of a majestic dragon that will do anything to protect its valuable treasures.\n\nHigh 5 Games offers a graphically perfect slot game with a grid at the center of the screen and above it, 5 special counters that, once filled, award a multiplier ranging from 15x to 1,500x! This game is not only substance but also aesthetics, thanks to the high-level graphics. The symbols (gems, dragons, and specials) are drawn with precision, and the game benefits from micro-animations linked to wins.\n\nThe sound is also impressive, with a knightly-style music that combines occasional electronic flourishes.\n\nFeatures of Dragon Guard Jackpot Dash\n\nThere are 243 ways to win on a classic 5-reel, 3-row grid. The minimum bet is 0.15 Demo coins, and the maximum is 600. With a single spin, it's possible to win up to 1,830 times your bet. With the Turbo button, you can accelerate the reels' spin, while the Autoplay allows you to activate a variable number of automatic spins. You can set win and loss limits to keep your balance under control. The game's variability is high, with an RTP of 96%.\n\nSymbols in Dragon Guard Jackpot Dash\n\nTo win at Dragon Guard Jackpot Dash, you need to match 3 to 5 symbols except for the dragon, with which you can create combos of up to 10 symbols. Values of the symbols vary, with the least lucrative being the playing cards from J to A, followed by the three diadems (pink, green, and blue). The dragon is the most valuable symbol, while the icon with two dragons counts as two symbols.\n\nWilds substitute all symbols except for the Scatter. When the Wild has a combo with the dragon, it replaces two symbols. The Bonus Scatter activates 10 free spins when at least 3 appear. During the Bonus Game, players move to a new grid, and with another 3 Scatters, you earn another 5 free spins. During the base game, symbols may appear with a gem identical to that on its counter above the grid. When the counter is full, a multiplier ranging from 15x to 1,500x is applied to your bet.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow many ways are there to win in Dragon Guard Jackpot Dash?\n\nThere are 243 ways to win in Dragon Guard Jackpot Dash.\n\nWhat is the highest payout in Dragon Guard Jackpot Dash?\n\nThe highest payout is 1,830 times your bet.\n\nWhat is the volatility of this slot game?\n\nThe volatility in Dragon Guard Jackpot Dash is high.\n            ",
