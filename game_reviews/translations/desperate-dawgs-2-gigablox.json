Here, all dawgs have unique features with which you can win up to 9,872 times your bet per spin. Sounds interesting? Then read my complete review below and find out more about this fantastic version.\n\nHow to play Desperate Dawgs 2 slot:\nThe Gigablox Desperate Dawgs 2 slot plays on 6 reels, 4 rows, and 40 paylines. However, the reels can increase up to 8 rows during the bonus round, guaranteeing 100 paylines, which is not bad at all. Thanks to the Gigablox mechanic, max sized symbols from 2×2 to 6×6 can be created randomly. Utilizing the bonus features like Train Robber, Gunslinger, and Bad Boy will make the game even more exciting.\n\nBets and Payouts offered in Desperate Dawgs 2:\nThe available betting options in Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox range from €0.10 to €100 per spin, offering more than enough combinations to meet your gaming needs. While testing the game and preparing my review, I found out that the maximum win can reach 9,872 times the bet, and the RTP is 95.50%. In terms of volatility, this registration-free slot is classified as medium to high, resulting in less frequent but higher value payouts.\n\nSymbols and Graphics in Desperate Dawgs sequel:\nSimilar to the first Desperate Dawgs slot, the sequel has a Wild West theme with 3 angry dogs at the center of the gameplay. The design is fluid and colorful, with modernized graphics compared to the first version. The reels are dominated by different symbols divided into two groups:\n1. The first group includes standard low-value card suit icons (flowers, spades, diamonds, and hearts);\n2. The second group is comprised of typical Far West symbols such as a revolver, the sheriff's badge, and the slot's logo. There is also a wild symbol that substitutes for all regular symbols to help you form winning combinations. Finally, the three dog stars act as scatter symbols and are called: Train Robber, Gunslinger, and Bad Boy. Each of them activates their respective functions.\n\nGameplay and Special Features in the game:\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox slot is built with the Gigablox mechanic. This means that during your spins, you can expect to get larger symbols from 2×2 to 6×6, resulting in high-value wins. In addition to Gigablox, you will benefit from 3 exciting features. Let's see what they have to offer!\n· Train Robber Feature: To activate the Train Robber feature, you must land 6 or more red scatter symbols in the same spin. The number of free spins you will get is equal to the number of scatters that triggered the feature. In each free spin, you will see 3 railway carriages that can contain gold, silver, banknotes, dynamite, or an empty space (consult the Paytable for all details);\n· Gunslinger Feature: To activate the Gunslinger feature, you must land 6 or more yellow scatter symbols in the same spin. You will win a number of shots equal to the number of scatters that activated the bonus. At the beginning, you will have to choose between a lower or higher volatile gun. The lower one offers multipliers of 1x, 2x, 2x, 3x, 3x, or 4x the bet, while the higher one offers five 1x and one 10x. Each shot will reveal a multiplier that will be added to the total win amount;\n· Bad Boy Feature: To activate the Bad Boy feature, you must land 6 or more green scatter symbols in the same spin. The number of FS you will get is equal to the number of scatters that activated the feature. When a winning combination is formed, 1 extra row and 15 extra paylines are added to the reels. If you form a new winning combination on the expanded reel set, you will win 2 extra spins. Reels can increase up to 6×8 in size with 100 paylines;\n· Golden Bet Feature: You can activate the Golden Bet for 50% of the bet amount to increase your chances of activating a bonus round.\n\nFAQs:\n What are the other Wild West-themed slots from Reflex Gaming?\n\nOn our always updated Reflex Gaming catalog, you can try the following free slots in Demo version: Wild Chapo Dream Drop, Desperate Dawgs, and Hillbilly Vegas. If you prefer to go straight to the real money version, all you have to do is select one of the ADM casinos, register, and withdraw the new 2023 welcome bonus.\n\nWhat is the highest paying symbol in the game?\n\nThe most rewarding element is Wild. Five Wilds on the payline award a 20x multiplier.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player in Desperate Dawgs 2 slot?\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) rate of the Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox slot is 95.50%, slightly below the industry average."

Here, all dawgs have unique features with which you can win up to 9,872 times your bet per spin. Sounds interesting? Then read my complete review below and find out more about this fantastic version.\n\nHow to play Desperate Dawgs 2 slot:\nThe Gigablox Desperate Dawgs 2 slot plays on 6 reels, 4 rows, and 40 paylines. However, the reels can increase up to 8 rows during the bonus round, guaranteeing 100 paylines, which is not bad at all. Thanks to the Gigablox mechanic, max sized symbols from 2×2 to 6×6 can be created randomly. Utilizing the bonus features like Train Robber, Gunslinger, and Bad Boy will make the game even more exciting.\n\nBets and Payouts offered in Desperate Dawgs 2:\nThe available betting options in Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox range from €0.10 to €100 per spin, offering more than enough combinations to meet your gaming needs. While testing the game and preparing my review, I found out that the maximum win can reach 9,872 times the bet, and the RTP is 95.50%. In terms of volatility, this registration-free slot is classified as medium to high, resulting in less frequent but higher value payouts.\n\nSymbols and Graphics in Desperate Dawgs sequel:\nSimilar to the first Desperate Dawgs slot, the sequel has a Wild West theme with 3 angry dogs at the center of the gameplay. The design is fluid and colorful, with modernized graphics compared to the first version. The reels are dominated by different symbols divided into two groups:\n1. The first group includes standard low-value card suit icons (flowers, spades, diamonds, and hearts);\n2. The second group is comprised of typical Far West symbols such as a revolver, the sheriff's badge, and the slot's logo. There is also a wild symbol that substitutes for all regular symbols to help you form winning combinations. Finally, the three dog stars act as scatter symbols and are called: Train Robber, Gunslinger, and Bad Boy. Each of them activates their respective functions.\n\nGameplay and Special Features in the game:\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox slot is built with the Gigablox mechanic. This means that during your spins, you can expect to get larger symbols from 2×2 to 6×6, resulting in high-value wins. In addition to Gigablox, you will benefit from 3 exciting features. Let's see what they have to offer!\n· Train Robber Feature: To activate the Train Robber feature, you must land 6 or more red scatter symbols in the same spin. The number of free spins you will get is equal to the number of scatters that triggered the feature. In each free spin, you will see 3 railway carriages that can contain gold, silver, banknotes, dynamite, or an empty space (consult the Paytable for all details);\n· Gunslinger Feature: To activate the Gunslinger feature, you must land 6 or more yellow scatter symbols in the same spin. You will win a number of shots equal to the number of scatters that activated the bonus. At the beginning, you will have to choose between a lower or higher volatile gun. The lower one offers multipliers of 1x, 2x, 2x, 3x, 3x, or 4x the bet, while the higher one offers five 1x and one 10x. Each shot will reveal a multiplier that will be added to the total win amount;\n· Bad Boy Feature: To activate the Bad Boy feature, you must land 6 or more green scatter symbols in the same spin. The number of FS you will get is equal to the number of scatters that activated the feature. When a winning combination is formed, 1 extra row and 15 extra paylines are added to the reels. If you form a new winning combination on the expanded reel set, you will win 2 extra spins. Reels can increase up to 6×8 in size with 100 paylines;\n· Golden Bet Feature: You can activate the Golden Bet for 50% of the bet amount to increase your chances of activating a bonus round.\n\nFAQs:\n What are the other Wild West-themed slots from Reflex Gaming?\n\nOn our always updated Reflex Gaming catalog, you can try the following free slots in Demo version: Wild Chapo Dream Drop, Desperate Dawgs, and Hillbilly Vegas. If you prefer to go straight to the real money version, all you have to do is select one of the ADM casinos, register, and withdraw the new 2023 welcome bonus.\n\nWhat is the highest paying symbol in the game?\n\nThe most rewarding element is Wild. Five Wilds on the payline award a 20x multiplier.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player in Desperate Dawgs 2 slot?\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) rate of the Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox slot is 95.50%, slightly below the industry average.\n            ",

Here, all dawgs have unique features with which you can win up to 9,872 times your bet per spin. Sounds interesting? Then read my complete review below and find out more about this fantastic version.\n\nHow to play Desperate Dawgs 2 slot:\nThe Gigablox Desperate Dawgs 2 slot plays on 6 reels, 4 rows, and 40 paylines. However, the reels can increase up to 8 rows during the bonus round, guaranteeing 100 paylines, which is not bad at all. Thanks to the Gigablox mechanic, max sized symbols from 2×2 to 6×6 can be created randomly. Utilizing the bonus features like Train Robber, Gunslinger, and Bad Boy will make the game even more exciting.\n\nBets and Payouts offered in Desperate Dawgs 2:\nThe available betting options in Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox range from €0.10 to €100 per spin, offering more than enough combinations to meet your gaming needs. While testing the game and preparing my review, I found out that the maximum win can reach 9,872 times the bet, and the RTP is 95.50%. In terms of volatility, this registration-free slot is classified as medium to high, resulting in less frequent but higher value payouts.\n\nSymbols and Graphics in Desperate Dawgs sequel:\nSimilar to the first Desperate Dawgs slot, the sequel has a Wild West theme with 3 angry dogs at the center of the gameplay. The design is fluid and colorful, with modernized graphics compared to the first version. The reels are dominated by different symbols divided into two groups:\n1. The first group includes standard low-value card suit icons (flowers, spades, diamonds, and hearts);\n2. The second group is comprised of typical Far West symbols such as a revolver, the sheriff's badge, and the slot's logo. There is also a wild symbol that substitutes for all regular symbols to help you form winning combinations. Finally, the three dog stars act as scatter symbols and are called: Train Robber, Gunslinger, and Bad Boy. Each of them activates their respective functions.\n\nGameplay and Special Features in the game:\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox slot is built with the Gigablox mechanic. This means that during your spins, you can expect to get larger symbols from 2×2 to 6×6, resulting in high-value wins. In addition to Gigablox, you will benefit from 3 exciting features. Let's see what they have to offer!\n· Train Robber Feature: To activate the Train Robber feature, you must land 6 or more red scatter symbols in the same spin. The number of free spins you will get is equal to the number of scatters that triggered the feature. In each free spin, you will see 3 railway carriages that can contain gold, silver, banknotes, dynamite, or an empty space (consult the Paytable for all details);\n· Gunslinger Feature: To activate the Gunslinger feature, you must land 6 or more yellow scatter symbols in the same spin. You will win a number of shots equal to the number of scatters that activated the bonus. At the beginning, you will have to choose between a lower or higher volatile gun. The lower one offers multipliers of 1x, 2x, 2x, 3x, 3x, or 4x the bet, while the higher one offers five 1x and one 10x. Each shot will reveal a multiplier that will be added to the total win amount;\n· Bad Boy Feature: To activate the Bad Boy feature, you must land 6 or more green scatter symbols in the same spin. The number of FS you will get is equal to the number of scatters that activated the feature. When a winning combination is formed, 1 extra row and 15 extra paylines are added to the reels. If you form a new winning combination on the expanded reel set, you will win 2 extra spins. Reels can increase up to 6×8 in size with 100 paylines;\n· Golden Bet Feature: You can activate the Golden Bet for 50% of the bet amount to increase your chances of activating a bonus round.\n\nFAQs:\n What are the other Wild West-themed slots from Reflex Gaming?\n\nOn our always updated Reflex Gaming catalog, you can try the following free slots in Demo version: Wild Chapo Dream Drop, Desperate Dawgs, and Hillbilly Vegas. If you prefer to go straight to the real money version, all you have to do is select one of the ADM casinos, register, and withdraw the new 2023 welcome bonus.\n\nWhat is the highest paying symbol in the game?\n\nThe most rewarding element is Wild. Five Wilds on the payline award a 20x multiplier.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player in Desperate Dawgs 2 slot?\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) rate of the Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox slot is 95.50%, slightly below the industry average.\n            ",

Then read my complete review below and find out more about this fantastic version.\n\nHow to play Desperate Dawgs 2 slot:\nThe Gigablox Desperate Dawgs 2 slot plays on 6 reels, 4 rows, and 40 paylines. However, the reels can increase up to 8 rows during the bonus round, guaranteeing 100 paylines, which is not bad at all. Thanks to the Gigablox mechanic, max sized symbols from 2×2 to 6×6 can be created randomly. Utilizing the bonus features like Train Robber, Gunslinger, and Bad Boy will make the game even more exciting.\n\nBets and Payouts offered in Desperate Dawgs 2:\nThe available betting options in Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox range from €0.10 to €100 per spin, offering more than enough combinations to meet your gaming needs. While testing the game and preparing my review, I found out that the maximum win can reach 9,872 times the bet, and the RTP is 95.50%. In terms of volatility, this registration-free slot is classified as medium to high, resulting in less frequent but higher value payouts.\n\nSymbols and Graphics in Desperate Dawgs sequel:\nSimilar to the first Desperate Dawgs slot, the sequel has a Wild West theme with 3 angry dogs at the center of the gameplay. The design is fluid and colorful, with modernized graphics compared to the first version. The reels are dominated by different symbols divided into two groups:\n1. The first group includes standard low-value card suit icons (flowers, spades, diamonds, and hearts);\n2. The second group is comprised of typical Far West symbols such as a revolver, the sheriff's badge, and the slot's logo. There is also a wild symbol that substitutes for all regular symbols to help you form winning combinations. Finally, the three dog stars act as scatter symbols and are called: Train Robber, Gunslinger, and Bad Boy. Each of them activates their respective functions.\n\nGameplay and Special Features in the game:\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox slot is built with the Gigablox mechanic. This means that during your spins, you can expect to get larger symbols from 2×2 to 6×6, resulting in high-value wins. In addition to Gigablox, you will benefit from 3 exciting features. Let's see what they have to offer!\n· Train Robber Feature: To activate the Train Robber feature, you must land 6 or more red scatter symbols in the same spin. The number of free spins you will get is equal to the number of scatters that triggered the feature. In each free spin, you will see 3 railway carriages that can contain gold, silver, banknotes, dynamite, or an empty space (consult the Paytable for all details);\n· Gunslinger Feature: To activate the Gunslinger feature, you must land 6 or more yellow scatter symbols in the same spin. You will win a number of shots equal to the number of scatters that activated the bonus. At the beginning, you will have to choose between a lower or higher volatile gun. The lower one offers multipliers of 1x, 2x, 2x, 3x, 3x, or 4x the bet, while the higher one offers five 1x and one 10x. Each shot will reveal a multiplier that will be added to the total win amount;\n· Bad Boy Feature: To activate the Bad Boy feature, you must land 6 or more green scatter symbols in the same spin. The number of FS you will get is equal to the number of scatters that activated the feature. When a winning combination is formed, 1 extra row and 15 extra paylines are added to the reels. If you form a new winning combination on the expanded reel set, you will win 2 extra spins. Reels can increase up to 6×8 in size with 100 paylines;\n· Golden Bet Feature: You can activate the Golden Bet for 50% of the bet amount to increase your chances of activating a bonus round.\n\nFAQs:\n What are the other Wild West-themed slots from Reflex Gaming?\n\nOn our always updated Reflex Gaming catalog, you can try the following free slots in Demo version: Wild Chapo Dream Drop, Desperate Dawgs, and Hillbilly Vegas.
