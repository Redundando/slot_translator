With stacked wilds and split symbols, this slot combines high potential, an irresistible theme, and fantastic sounds and images to take you back to the most fascinating period in the history of the Earth! With five reels and 50 paylines, Double Dinosaur Deluxe is playable on all devices from 0.50 to 500.00 credits per spin. Travel back to where it all began with our intrepid explorers in search of new and even more dangerous dinosaurs.\n\nPrehistoric Graphics\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe is a step up from the original Double Dinosaur in terms of look and feel, even though our original team of archaeologists is still on the edge. It’s fun to tell a story starting from the symbols on offer - is the map an indication of the location of the last dinosaurs? Which dinosaur had a skull like that? And the dinosaurs and human characters are well-drawn, with some superb animations that drive the story as it unfolds.\n\nThe biggest dinosaur fossil finds have been made in North America, China, and Argentina, but we’re in a mythical valley where dinosaurs still roam and a volcano ominously smokes on the horizon. Will our intrepid explorers be forced to flee for their lives from the erupting volcano or the wild dinosaurs that populate the reels?\n\nWe also liked the mysterious and slightly threatening soundtrack that helps raise the suspense. Are our heroes on the road to the greatest discovery of their careers? Or are they in for a rude awakening?\n\nThis highly playable game comes with a theoretical RTP of 95%. The volatility is medium to high, which suits high-level players - hence the potential high values per spin. Thanks to the base game modifiers, however, there are some decent wins to be had without hitting the free spin bonus feature.\n\nThere’s only one bonus feature available in Double Dinosaur Deluxe, but with a maximum of 96 free spins available, it's worth landing.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nDino Eye Free Spins: The Dino Eye symbol is the scatter and appears on the central reels 2, 3, and 4. Land with three symbols anywhere on the reels to trigger six initial free spins that take place on a new set of reels where meteors rain from the sky and the volcano is in full eruption. All wins pay from left to right and right to left.\n\nLand three more scatter symbols during the free spins to get another six free spins. The feature ends when there are no more remaining free spins or 96 have been played.\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe is quite simple in gameplay, relying on matching symbols on a payline - access paytable information through the menu to find out how paylines behave and how symbol payouts are calculated.\n\nWith 50 paylines in play, there are many opportunities to get a winning combination of three or more symbols. And this is where Double Dinosaur Deluxe becomes interesting - thanks to split symbols counting as the equivalent of two symbols, it’s possible to create combinations of up to ten matching icons for the biggest wins.\n\nThe highest-paying paytable symbol is the expedition leader, which rewards the player with 5000 coins when ten symbols hit a winning payline. The co-leader earns 3000 credits, while the T. Rex adds a roaring 2000 credits to your bankroll when you land ten symbols on one of the 50 paylines.\n\nThere are a number of in-game modifiers that increase the chances of creating that big win.\n\nSplit Symbols: These are an H5G trademark and are used in a number of slots. Symbols appear with a single image or with the same image replicated. These split symbols increase excitement by creating the possibility of doubled combinations of up to ten symbols for the biggest wins.\n\nIn this slot, all dinosaur symbols plus the two explorers pay in combinations of three to ten symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nFor a truly unique Jurassic-era experience, spin the reels of Dino Dollars. It’s another stunning slot by High 5 Games, with dinosaurs charging through six reels sets, each of which contains two symbol positions. The innovative setup is completed by giant wilds, free games, and the popular Symbol Fusion feature.",

Landing with three symbols anywhere on the reels will trigger six initial free spins that take place on a new set of reels where meteors rain from the sky and the volcano is in full eruption. All wins pay left to right and right to left.\n\nLand another three scatter symbols during the free spins to get another six free spins. The feature ends when there are no more free spins left or 96 have been played.\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe is fairly straightforward in gameplay, relying on matching symbols on a payline – access the paytable information through the menu to find out how paylines behave and how symbol payouts are calculated.\n\nWith 50 paylines in play, there are many opportunities to get a winning combination of three or more symbols. And this is where Double Dinosaur Deluxe becomes interesting – thanks to the split symbols that count as the equivalent of two symbols, it's possible to create combinations up to ten matching icons.\n\nThe highest paying paytable symbol is the expedition leader, which rewards the player with 5000 coins when ten symbols hit a winning payline. The co-leader earns 3000 credits, while the T. Rex adds a roaring 2000 credits to your bankroll when you land ten symbols on one of the 50 paylines.\n\nThere are a number of in-game modifiers in the base game that increase the chances of creating that big win.\n\nSplit symbols: these are an H5G hallmark and are used in a number of slots. The symbols appear with a single image or with the same image replicated. These split symbols increase excitement by creating the possibility of doubled combinations of up to ten symbols for the biggest wins.\n\nIn this slot, all dinosaur symbols plus the two explorers pay in combinations of three to ten symbols.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nFor a truly unique experience in the Jurassic era, spin the reels of Dino Dollars. It's another great slot from High 5 Games, with dinosaurs charging across six sets of reels, each with two symbol positions. The innovative setup is completed by giant wilds, free games, and the popular Symbol Fusion feature."

With stacked wilds and split symbols, this slot combines high potential, an irresistible theme, and fantastic sounds and images to take you back to the most fascinating period in the history of the Earth! With five reels and 50 paylines, Double Dinosaur Deluxe is playable on all devices from 0.50 to 500.00 credits per spin. Travel back to where it all began with our intrepid explorers in search of new and even more dangerous dinosaurs.\n\nPrehistoric Graphics\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe is a step up from the original Double Dinosaur in terms of look and feel, even though our original team of archaeologists is still on the edge. It’s fun to tell a story starting from the symbols on offer - is the map an indication of the location of the last dinosaurs? Which dinosaur had a skull like that? And the dinosaurs and human characters are well-drawn, with some superb animations that drive the story as it unfolds.\n\nThe biggest dinosaur fossil finds have been made in North America, China, and Argentina, but we’re in a mythical valley where dinosaurs still roam and a volcano ominously smokes on the horizon. Will our intrepid explorers be forced to flee for their lives from the erupting volcano or the wild dinosaurs that populate the reels?\n\nWe also liked the mysterious and slightly threatening soundtrack that helps raise the suspense. Are our heroes on the road to the greatest discovery of their careers? Or are they in for a rude awakening?\n\nThis highly playable game comes with a theoretical RTP of 95%. The volatility is medium to high, which suits high-level players - hence the potential high values per spin. Thanks to the base game modifiers, however, there are some decent wins to be had without hitting the free spin bonus feature.\n\nThere’s only one bonus feature available in Double Dinosaur Deluxe, but with a maximum of 96 free spins available, it's worth landing.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nDino Eye Free Spins: The Dino Eye symbol is the scatter and appears on the central reels 2, 3, and 4. Land with three symbols anywhere on the reels to trigger six initial free spins that take place on a new set of reels where meteors rain from the sky and the volcano is in full eruption. All wins pay from left to right and right to left.\n\nLand three more scatter symbols during the free spins to get another six free spins. The feature ends when there are no more remaining free spins or 96 have been played.\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe is quite simple in gameplay, relying on matching symbols on a payline - access paytable information through the menu to find out how paylines behave and how symbol payouts are calculated.\n\nWith 50 paylines in play, there are many opportunities to get a winning combination of three or more symbols. And this is where Double Dinosaur Deluxe becomes interesting - thanks to split symbols counting as the equivalent of two symbols, it’s possible to create combinations of up to ten matching icons for the biggest wins.\n\nThe highest-paying paytable symbol is the expedition leader, which rewards the player with 5000 coins when ten symbols hit a winning payline. The co-leader earns 3000 credits, while the T. Rex adds a roaring 2000 credits to your bankroll when you land ten symbols on one of the 50 paylines.\n\nThere are a number of in-game modifiers that increase the chances of creating that big win.\n\nSplit Symbols: These are an H5G trademark and are used in a number of slots. Symbols appear with a single image or with the same image replicated. These split symbols increase excitement by creating the possibility of doubled combinations of up to ten symbols for the biggest wins.\n\nIn this slot, all dinosaur symbols plus the two explorers pay in combinations of three to ten symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nFor a truly unique Jurassic-era experience, spin the reels of Dino Dollars. It’s another stunning slot by High 5 Games, with dinosaurs charging through six reels sets, each of which contains two symbol positions. The innovative setup is completed by giant wilds, free games, and the popular Symbol Fusion feature.\n            ",

It has a medium to high volatility and an RTP of 95%. The game relies on matching symbols on a payline. Thanks to the base game modifiers, it is possible to create combinations of up to ten matching icons for the biggest wins. With split symbols counting as the equivalent of two symbols, it’s easier to hit winning combinations.\n\nBonus Features\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe has only one bonus feature: Dino Eye Free Spins. This feature is triggered by landing three scatter symbols (Dino Eye) on the central reels 2, 3, and 4. The player gets six initial free spins on a new set of reels where meteors rain from the sky, and all wins pay from left to right and right to left. Land another three scattered symbols during the feature to get another six free spins, up to a maximum of 96 free spins.\n\nVisuals\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe has a compelling theme with well-drawn human characters and dinosaurs. The symbols are vivid and exciting, and the animations bring them to life. The graphics are a step up from the original Double Dinosaur game, and the visuals of the prehistoric world are fascinating. The mysterious and slightly threatening soundtrack adds to the suspense and immerses the player in the world of the dinosaurs.\n\nVolatility\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe has a medium to high volatility. This suits high-level players due to the potential for high-value spins. However, the base game modifiers offer some decent wins without triggering the free spin bonus feature. The game isn't recommended for those who prefer low volatility slots.\n\nRTP\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe has a theoretical RTP of 95%, which is average compared to other online slots. The game offers a good potential for big wins, but players should remember that this is a long-term average and that individual results may vary.\n\nDevice Compatibility\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe is playable on all devices, including desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. The game is optimized for mobile play, so players can enjoy it on the go. The game doesn't require any additional downloads or software, as it runs on HTML5 technology. It is compatible with iOS, Android, and Windows devices.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nFor those who love the Jurassic era theme, High 5 Games' Dino Dollars is highly recommended. It is another stunning slot with a unique six-reel setup, giant wilds, free games, and the popular Symbol Fusion feature. Other similar slots include Jurassic Park by Microgaming, Jurassic World by Red Tiger, and Raging Rex by Play'n GO.\n\n        \n            ",

With stacked wilds and split symbols, this slot combines high potential, an irresistible theme, and fantastic sounds and images to take you back to the most fascinating period in the history of the Earth! With five reels and 50 paylines, Double Dinosaur Deluxe is playable on all devices from 0.50 to 500.00 credits per spin. Travel back to where it all began with our intrepid explorers in search of new and even more dangerous dinosaurs.\n\nPrehistoric Graphics\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe is a step up from the original Double Dinosaur in terms of look and feel, even though our original team of archaeologists is still on the edge. It’s fun to tell a story starting from the symbols on offer - is the map an indication of the location of the last dinosaurs? Which dinosaur had a skull like that? And the dinosaurs and human characters are well-drawn, with some superb animations that drive the story as it unfolds.\n\nThe biggest dinosaur fossil finds have been made in North America, China, and Argentina, but we’re in a mythical valley where dinosaurs still roam and a volcano ominously smokes on the horizon. Will our intrepid explorers be forced to flee for their lives from the erupting volcano or the wild dinosaurs that populate the reels?\n\nWe also liked the mysterious and slightly threatening soundtrack that helps raise the suspense. Are our heroes on the road to the greatest discovery of their careers? Or are they in for a rude awakening?\n\nThis highly playable game comes with a theoretical RTP of 95%. The volatility is medium to high, which suits high-level players - hence the potential high values per spin. Thanks to the base game modifiers, however, there are some decent wins to be had without hitting the free spin bonus feature.\n\nThere’s only one bonus feature available in Double Dinosaur Deluxe, but with a maximum of 96 free spins available, it's worth landing.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nDino Eye Free Spins: The Dino Eye symbol is the scatter and appears on the central reels 2, 3, and 4. Land with three symbols anywhere on the reels to trigger six initial free spins that take place on a new set of reels where meteors rain from the sky and the volcano is in full eruption. All wins pay from left to right and right to left.\n\nLand three more scatter symbols during the free spins to get another six free spins. The feature ends when there are no more remaining free spins or 96 have been played.\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe is quite simple in gameplay, relying on matching symbols on a payline - access paytable information through the menu to find out how paylines behave and how symbol payouts are calculated.\n\nWith 50 paylines in play, there are many opportunities to get a winning combination of three or more symbols. And this is where Double Dinosaur Deluxe becomes interesting - thanks to split symbols counting as the equivalent of two symbols, it’s possible to create combinations of up to ten matching icons for the biggest wins.\n\nThe highest-paying paytable symbol is the expedition leader, which rewards the player with 5000 coins when ten symbols hit a winning payline. The co-leader earns 3000 credits, while the T. Rex adds a roaring 2000 credits to your bankroll when you land ten symbols on one of the 50 paylines.\n\nThere are a number of in-game modifiers that increase the chances of creating that big win.\n\nSplit Symbols: These are an H5G trademark and are used in a number of slots. Symbols appear with a single image or with the same image replicated. These split symbols increase excitement by creating the possibility of doubled combinations of up to ten symbols for the biggest wins.\n\nIn this slot, all dinosaur symbols plus the two explorers pay in combinations of three to ten symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nFor a truly unique Jurassic-era experience, spin the reels of Dino Dollars. It’s another stunning slot by High 5 Games, with dinosaurs charging through six reels sets, each of which contains two symbol positions. The innovative setup is completed by giant wilds, free games, and the popular Symbol Fusion feature.\n            ",

With stacked wilds and split symbols, this slot combines high potential, an irresistible theme, and fantastic sounds and images to take you back to the most fascinating period in the history of the Earth! With five reels and 50 paylines, Double Dinosaur Deluxe is playable on all devices from 0.50 to 500.00 credits per spin. Travel back to where it all began with our intrepid explorers in search of new and even more dangerous dinosaurs.\n\nPrehistoric Graphics\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe is a step up from the original Double Dinosaur in terms of look and feel, even though our original team of archaeologists is still on the edge. It’s fun to tell a story starting from the symbols on offer - is the map an indication of the location of the last dinosaurs? Which dinosaur had a skull like that? And the dinosaurs and human characters are well-drawn, with some superb animations that drive the story as it unfolds.\n\nThe biggest dinosaur fossil finds have been made in North America, China, and Argentina, but we’re in a mythical valley where dinosaurs still roam and a volcano ominously smokes on the horizon. Will our intrepid explorers be forced to flee for their lives from the erupting volcano or the wild dinosaurs that populate the reels?\n\nWe also liked the mysterious and slightly threatening soundtrack that helps raise the suspense. Are our heroes on the road to the greatest discovery of their careers? Or are they in for a rude awakening?\n\nThis highly playable game comes with a theoretical RTP of 95%. The volatility is medium to high, which suits high-level players - hence the potential high values per spin. Thanks to the base game modifiers, however, there are some decent wins to be had without hitting the free spin bonus feature.\n\nThere’s only one bonus feature available in Double Dinosaur Deluxe, but with a maximum of 96 free spins available, it's worth landing.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nDino Eye Free Spins: The Dino Eye symbol is the scatter and appears on the central reels 2, 3, and 4. Land with three symbols anywhere on the reels to trigger six initial free spins that take place on a new set of reels where meteors rain from the sky and the volcano is in full eruption. All wins pay from left to right and right to left.\n\nLand three more scatter symbols during the free spins to get another six free spins. The feature ends when there are no more remaining free spins or 96 have been played.\n\nDouble Dinosaur Deluxe is quite simple in gameplay, relying on matching symbols on a payline - access paytable information through the menu to find out how paylines behave and how symbol payouts are calculated.\n\nWith 50 paylines in play, there are many opportunities to get a winning combination of three or more symbols. And this is where Double Dinosaur Deluxe becomes interesting - thanks to split symbols counting as the equivalent of two symbols, it’s possible to create combinations of up to ten matching icons for the biggest wins.\n\nThe highest-paying paytable symbol is the expedition leader, which rewards the player with 5000 coins when ten symbols hit a winning payline. The co-leader earns 3000 credits, while the T. Rex adds a roaring 2000 credits to your bankroll when you land ten symbols on one of the 50 paylines.\n\nThere are a number of in-game modifiers that increase the chances of creating that big win.\n\nSplit Symbols: These are an H5G trademark and are used in a number of slots. Symbols appear with a single image or with the same image replicated. These split symbols increase excitement by creating the possibility of doubled combinations of up to ten symbols for the biggest wins.\n\nIn this slot, all dinosaur symbols plus the two explorers pay in combinations of three to ten symbols.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nFor a truly unique Jurassic-era experience, spin the reels of Dino Dollars. It’s another stunning slot by High 5 Games, with dinosaurs charging through six reels sets, each of which contains two symbol positions. The innovative setup is completed by giant wilds, free games, and the popular Symbol Fusion feature.\n            ",
