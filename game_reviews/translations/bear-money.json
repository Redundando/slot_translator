Set in those woods, Bear Money is an online slot developed by Inspired Gaming with an interesting respin feature and some other very interesting features.\n\nDeveloped by Inspired, this online slot has five reels, three rows, and ten important paylines. The game is set in the forest, a quiet and pleasant environment just ripe for a relaxing weekend picnic. The sun is shining and the scene is certainly attractive. After all, who doesn't like a summer picnic? But wait! The bears in the forest have other ideas! They want to have their cake and eat it too; in other words, your picnic! Protecting your picnic is necessary to keep your snacks and tasty treats away from these hungry and furry thieves!\n\nAn animalistic graphics\nBear Money is a five-reel slot machine with three rows and ten fixed paylines; a rough wooden frame supports the reels and the entire structure is set against the backdrop of the forest where this anthropomorphic theft takes place. Among the high-value symbols are the Bear Money logo, a blueberry cake, a sandwich, a piece of cheese, a picnic basket, a dollop of homemade jam on bread, and a refreshing jug of juice; J, Q, K, and A make up the lower values; there is no wild symbol in Bear Money, but there is a honey bonus jar on reel five.\n\nKeep an eye on the high-value symbols - these are the Bear Money logo, a delicious and crushing blueberry cake, a picnic ribbon, the sandwich, a large piece of cheese, fresh bread and whipped homemade jam, and a refreshing carafe of juice, as well as that all-important picnic basket to keep the goodies. The lower values are made up of the letters J, Q, K, and A. And though there's no wild symbol in the game, honey lovers will be pleased to see a bonus jar of the sticky stuff on reel five.\n\nOne of the best things about Bear Money is that you can decide how to play, whether you choose the autoplay button or click the bet button to adjust any amount of wager. Check the Turbo setting if you want to play faster and enhance your gaming experience, and if your game history interests you, there's also the option to view your game history.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe combination of 6 or more picnic symbols that appear anywhere on the first 4 reels, along with an attractive honey pot bonus symbol on number 5, activates the Collection Bonus feature. During this feature, only two symbols are active, and these are the picnic baskets and - you guessed it - those bears playing and eating the picnic. If any of the positions appear empty and neither the basket nor the bear is seen, they occur up to 5 times. The function bear symbols act as multipliers.\n\nA rotation chance will be activated when a player's credit is lower than the current game price but not as low as zero. This chance allows players to bet their remaining credit with the possibility of winning another spin at the currently running bet level. To play it, just click on \"play\", with the pointer moving through the counter. If it lands on the green part, a spin is assigned to the current bet, and if it lands on the red part, any remaining credit is lost and players are taken back to the start of the game.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame Overview\n\nBear Money is an online slot developed by Inspired Gaming with an interesting respin feature and some other very interesting features. It has five reels, three rows, and ten important paylines. The game is set in the forest, a quiet and pleasant environment just ripe for a relaxing weekend picnic.\n\nGraphics and Symbols\n\nBear Money is a five-reel slot machine with three rows and ten fixed paylines; a rough wooden frame supports the reels and the entire structure is set against the backdrop of the forest where this anthropomorphic theft takes place. Among the high-value symbols are the Bear Money logo, a blueberry cake, a sandwich, a piece of cheese, a picnic basket, a dollop of homemade jam on bread, and a refreshing jug of juice; J, Q, K, and A make up the lower values; there is no wild symbol in Bear Money, but there is a honey bonus jar on reel five.\n\nGameplay\n\nOne of the best things about Bear Money is that you can decide how to play, whether you choose the autoplay button or click the bet button to adjust any amount of wager. Check the Turbo setting if you want to play faster and enhance your gaming experience, and if your game history interests you, there's also the option to view your game history.\n\nAutoplay and Betting\n\nThe autoplay button and the bet button allow you to play Bear Money however you prefer. The Turbo setting can be selected to speed up gameplay and viewable game history is also available for interested players.\n\nBonus Features\n\nBear Money does not have a free spins option but has a Multi Cash Collector Bonus. The combination of 6 or more picnic symbols that appear anywhere on the first 4 reels, along with an attractive honey pot bonus symbol on number 5, activates the Collection Bonus feature. It has bear symbols that act as multipliers and in which players can win additional cash bonuses during the game. \n\nMulti Cash Collector Bonus\n\nOne of its main features - and not just fun, but also lucrative - is the Multi Cash Collector Bonus with its grandiose title. This is triggered when a player lands 6 or more picnic baskets on reels one, two, three, and four plus a bonus symbol on reel number five. As a result, bear symbols appear, and players receive picnic baskets overflowing with cash goodies! During this bonus feature, when the basket and bear symbols are aligned, the rest of the reels repeat up to 5 times. Land a picnic basket and there is more money to be won!\n\nWild Symbols\n\nBear Money does not have a wild symbol, but the game does have a honey bonus jar on reel five, which can award additional cash bonuses during play.\n\nComparable Games\n\nAnother similar slot game is Big Bear, a 5-reel, 243 ways-to-win slot machine produced by Playtech. Set in a mysterious world, players join the big bear and other creatures in a search for big wins. It's all about free games, where players can choose from 3 options - more free spins with wild multipliers up to 4x or fewer free spins with wild multipliers up to 16x. There's also a Hold and Extra Spin feature where you get an extra spin with the wild locked in position - this allows another wild to land to give you a multiplier up to 36x!\n\n        \n            ",

Set in a forest, the game features bear symbols trying to steal picnic items. Players can use the respin and multi cash collector bonus features to win large amounts of cash.\n\nGraphics and Symbols\n\nBear Money has a wooden frame with symbols depicting various picnic items, including a blueberry cake, sandwich, cheese, homemade jam on bread, juice, and a picnic basket. Letters J, Q, K, and A are also used as symbols. The game graphics have a forest theme, and the bears in the game are anthropomorphic. There is no wild symbol in this game, but there is a honey bonus jar on reel five.\n\nRespin Feature\n\nWhen a player's credit is lower than the current game price but not as low as zero, a respin chance will be triggered. It allows players to bet their remaining credit and win another spin at the current bet level. If the player lands on the green section, a spin is awarded to the current bet, and if they land on the red section, any remaining credit is lost, and the game starts over.\n\nAutoplay and Betting Options\n\nPlayers can decide how to play, whether by using the autoplay button or the bet button. The game offers a Turbo setting for faster play, and players can also view their game history. The minimum bet for this game is 0.10, and players can adjust any amount of wager.\n\nNo Free Spins\n\nBear Money does not have the option of free spins. However, considering the abundance of spins in the game, this doesn't impact the gameplay experience negatively. \n\nMulti Cash Collector Bonus\n\nThe Multi Cash Collector Bonus is triggered when a player lands six or more picnic baskets on reels one to four and a bonus symbol on reel five. During this bonus feature, bear symbols appear, and players receive picnic baskets overflowing with cash. When baskets and bear symbols line up, the reels repeat up to five times, increasing the player's chances of winning. \n\nBear Multipliers\n\nThe function bear symbols in Bear Money act as multipliers. During the Collection Bonus feature, bear symbols increase the player's winnings.\n\nComparison to Similar Games\n\nBig Bear is another slot game with a similar forest theme. It has 243 ways-to-win and allows players to choose from three options for free games: more free spins with wild multipliers up to 4x, fewer free spins with wild multipliers up to 16x, or an Extra Spin feature with wilds locked in position for another chance to win. In contrast, Bear Money doesn't offer free spins but has respin and multi cash collector bonus features.\n\n        \n            ",

Set in those woods, Bear Money is an online slot developed by Inspired Gaming with an interesting respin feature and some other very interesting features.\n\nDeveloped by Inspired, this online slot has five reels, three rows, and ten important paylines. The game is set in the forest, a quiet and pleasant environment just ripe for a relaxing weekend picnic. The sun is shining and the scene is certainly attractive. After all, who doesn't like a summer picnic? But wait! The bears in the forest have other ideas! They want to have their cake and eat it too; in other words, your picnic! Protecting your picnic is necessary to keep your snacks and tasty treats away from these hungry and furry thieves!\n\nAn animalistic graphics\nBear Money is a five-reel slot machine with three rows and ten fixed paylines; a rough wooden frame supports the reels and the entire structure is set against the backdrop of the forest where this anthropomorphic theft takes place. Among the high-value symbols are the Bear Money logo, a blueberry cake, a sandwich, a piece of cheese, a picnic basket, a dollop of homemade jam on bread, and a refreshing jug of juice; J, Q, K, and A make up the lower values; there is no wild symbol in Bear Money, but there is a honey bonus jar on reel five.\n\nKeep an eye on the high-value symbols - these are the Bear Money logo, a delicious and crushing blueberry cake, a picnic ribbon, the sandwich, a large piece of cheese, fresh bread and whipped homemade jam, and a refreshing carafe of juice, as well as that all-important picnic basket to keep the goodies. The lower values are made up of the letters J, Q, K, and A. And though there's no wild symbol in the game, honey lovers will be pleased to see a bonus jar of the sticky stuff on reel five.\n\nOne of the best things about Bear Money is that you can decide how to play, whether you choose the autoplay button or click the bet button to adjust any amount of wager. Check the Turbo setting if you want to play faster and enhance your gaming experience, and if your game history interests you, there's also the option to view your game history.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe combination of 6 or more picnic symbols that appear anywhere on the first 4 reels, along with an attractive honey pot bonus symbol on number 5, activates the Collection Bonus feature. During this feature, only two symbols are active, and these are the picnic baskets and - you guessed it - those bears playing and eating the picnic. If any of the positions appear empty and neither the basket nor the bear is seen, they occur up to 5 times. The function bear symbols act as multipliers.\n\nA rotation chance will be activated when a player's credit is lower than the current game price but not as low as zero. This chance allows players to bet their remaining credit with the possibility of winning another spin at the currently running bet level. To play it, just click on \"play\", with the pointer moving through the counter. If it lands on the green part, a spin is assigned to the current bet, and if it lands on the red part, any remaining credit is lost and players are taken back to the start of the game. If you decide that you don't actually want to play the spin chance, then you can do this simply by selecting \"no thanks\", thus skipping this feature altogether.\n\nIt's worth noting that the game doesn't have the option of free spins, although with the abundance of spins, players won't miss it, and it's certainly not a negative point.\n\nOne of its main features - and not just fun, but also lucrative - is the Multi Cash Collector Bonus with its grandiose title. This is triggered when a player lands 6 or more picnic baskets on reels one, two, three, and four plus a bonus symbol on reel number five. As a result, bear symbols appear, and players receive picnic baskets overflowing with cash goodies! During this bonus feature, when the basket and bear symbols are aligned, the rest of the reels repeat up to 5 times. Land a picnic basket and there is more money to be won!\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\nBig Bear is a 5-reel, 243 ways-to-win Slot Machine produced by Playtech that you can play on all devices from 10 cents per spin. Set in a mysterious world, you join the big bear and other creatures in a search for big wins. It's all about free games, where you can choose from 3 options - you can opt for more free spins with wild multipliers up to 4x or fewer free spins with wild multipliers up to 16x. There's also a Hold and Extra Spin feature where you get an extra spin with the wild locked in position - this allows another wild to land to give you a multiplier up to 36x!\n            ",

Set in those woods, Bear Money is an online slot developed by Inspired Gaming with an interesting respin feature and some other very interesting features.\n\nDeveloped by Inspired, this online slot has five reels, three rows, and ten important paylines. The game is set in the forest, a quiet and pleasant environment just ripe for a relaxing weekend picnic. The sun is shining and the scene is certainly attractive. After all, who doesn't like a summer picnic? But wait! The bears in the forest have other ideas! They want to have their cake and eat it too; in other words, your picnic! Protecting your picnic is necessary to keep your snacks and tasty treats away from these hungry and furry thieves!\n\nAn animalistic graphics\nBear Money is a five-reel slot machine with three rows and ten fixed paylines; a rough wooden frame supports the reels and the entire structure is set against the backdrop of the forest where this anthropomorphic theft takes place. Among the high-value symbols are the Bear Money logo, a blueberry cake, a sandwich, a piece of cheese, a picnic basket, a dollop of homemade jam on bread, and a refreshing jug of juice; J, Q, K, and A make up the lower values; there is no wild symbol in Bear Money, but there is a honey bonus jar on reel five.\n\nKeep an eye on the high-value symbols - these are the Bear Money logo, a delicious and crushing blueberry cake, a picnic ribbon, the sandwich, a large piece of cheese, fresh bread and whipped homemade jam, and a refreshing carafe of juice, as well as that all-important picnic basket to keep the goodies. The lower values are made up of the letters J, Q, K, and A. And though there's no wild symbol in the game, honey lovers will be pleased to see a bonus jar of the sticky stuff on reel five.\n\nOne of the best things about Bear Money is that you can decide how to play, whether you choose the autoplay button or click the bet button to adjust any amount of wager. Check the Turbo setting if you want to play faster and enhance your gaming experience, and if your game history interests you, there's also the option to view your game history.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe combination of 6 or more picnic symbols that appear anywhere on the first 4 reels, along with an attractive honey pot bonus symbol on number 5, activates the Collection Bonus feature. During this feature, only two symbols are active, and these are the picnic baskets and - you guessed it - those bears playing and eating the picnic. If any of the positions appear empty and neither the basket nor the bear is seen, they occur up to 5 times. The function bear symbols act as multipliers.\n\nA rotation chance will be activated when a player's credit is lower than the current game price but not as low as zero. This chance allows players to bet their remaining credit with the possibility of winning another spin at the currently running bet level. To play it, just click on \"play\", with the pointer moving through the counter. If it lands on the green part, a spin is assigned to the current bet, and if it lands on the red part, any remaining credit is lost and players are taken back to the start of the game. If you decide that you don't actually want to play the spin chance, then you can do this simply by selecting \"no thanks\", thus skipping this feature altogether.\n\nIt's worth noting that the game doesn't have the option of free spins, although with the abundance of spins, players won't miss it, and it's certainly not a negative point.\n\nOne of its main features - and not just fun, but also lucrative - is the Multi Cash Collector Bonus with its grandiose title. This is triggered when a player lands 6 or more picnic baskets on reels one, two, three, and four plus a bonus symbol on reel number five. As a result, bear symbols appear, and players receive picnic baskets overflowing with cash goodies! During this bonus feature, when the basket and bear symbols are aligned, the rest of the reels repeat up to 5 times. Land a picnic basket and there is more money to be won!\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\nBig Bear is a 5-reel, 243 ways-to-win Slot Machine produced by Playtech that you can play on all devices from 10 cents per spin.
