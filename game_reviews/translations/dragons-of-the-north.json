Sì, ricorda vagamente l’idea del Trono di Spade, ma in realtà il lavoro di PariPlay vuole essere un altro. Con questa slot, che presenta 5 rulli e 50 linee di pagamento, si ha la possibilità di recuperare l’uovo di drago per vincere premi in denaro sfruttando una serie di caratteristiche speciali. Il tutto partendo da un RTP del 95,91%, che è in linea con la media del settore. Forse è meglio svegliare subito i draghi e mettere alla prova la tua sete di conquista!\nGrafica della slot\nDracarys! Sarà un vero piacere per i tuoi occhi avviare questa slot che cura nel minimo dettaglio il tema fantasy. Ci si trova di fronte a una finestra di gioco che è dedicata proprio al mondo dei draghi, con queste creature che sono posizionate tra le due colonne intagliate. Ogni movimento, ogni giro sulla griglia è scandito dalla colonna sonora alquanto inquietante che ti lascia spesso con il fiato sospeso. In questo mix di fuoco, realtà medievale e draghi feroci, sarà possibile addentrarsi in un bel gameplay che scorre senza alcun tipo di problema. Occhi puntati sul Wild, che ti permetterà di vincere fino a 20x la tua puntata.\nCaratteristiche di gioco e funzionalità speciali\nCome detto abbiamo diversi draghi blu, rossi, verdi e opachi: trovarne cinque in linea significa poter ricevere fino a 5x la tua scommessa. L’uovo in Dragons of the North è stato scelto come simbolo Scatter, capace di attivare i giri gratuiti, dare un premio in denaro e permetterti di accedere al jackpot interno della slot. Nel momento in cui si attiva il bonus game si ha una vincita istantanea che può aumentare fino a 100 volte il valore della sua scommessa originale. E considera che quando ti trovi nel gioco base saranno attivi solo i rulli 1, 3 e 5, ma durante la sessione dei free spin si attivano anche i due mancanti. Quando l’intera griglia è attiva possono apparire le icone del Jackpot anche sui rulli 2 e 4, e si può fare un giro sulla ruota bonus del montepremi. Il mini jackpot è pari a 15x la tua scommessa, il Minor sale a 35x, seguito poi dal Major che è a 250volte la puntata e per finire troviamo il Grand a 1000x la scommessa originale.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Dragons of The North\nLa fantasia è il vero mezzo fortunato per PariPlay che sembra pensare sempre a slot molto innovative e particolari. Tra draghi e caratteristiche questo titolo è uno dei miglio presenti online, soprattutto per i grandi premi offerti con i jackpot. Dragons of The North è un’ottima scelta per animazione, grafica e i bonus di gioco, capaci di catturare sia i giocatori esperti, ma anche le new entry.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nChe tipo di funzionalità sono disponibili nella slot Dragons of the North Megaways?\n\nIl gameplay include giri gratuiti, uova d'oro, una funzione di distruzione e molto altro ancora. Tutti questi elementi possono potenzialmente contribuire ad alcuni risultati redditizi.\n\n\n\nLa slot Dragons of the North Megaways è mobile friendly?\n\nSì, questo gioco con meccanismo Megaways è realizzato con la tecnologia HTML5, che lo rende completamente mobile-friendly.\n\n\n\nPosso giocare gratuitamente alla slot Dragons of the North?\n\nSì, Dragons of the North ha un'ottima modalità di gioco gratuita che ha tutte le funzionalità del gioco reale senza dover spendere nulla, perfetta per i giocatori ancora alle prime armi.
