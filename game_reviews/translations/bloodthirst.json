    "original_text": "\nBloodthirst\nTema e grafica\nIl tema horror è abbastanza utilizzato dagli sviluppatori di slot, anche se di solito si tratta di giochi dall’atmosfera scherzosa, più simile ai cartoni animati come Hotel Transilvania, in cui lo scopo è divertire piuttosto che spaventare. Non è il caso di Bloodthirst, che presenta invece un’atmosfera gotica, con i simboli che sembrano usciti da una pellicola di un film del terrore.\nQuesto aspetto risulta evidente sin dall’apertura della schermata principale, con la griglia impressa su una lastra di bronzo e sullo sfondo un villaggio fantasma con i tetti delle case illuminati dalla luna piena. I simboli principali sono vari mostri, vampiri, lupi mannari e demoni. Dobbiamo dire che guardandoli incutono un certo timore, merito anche dell’ottimo lavoro fatto sulla grafica.\nA far salire ancor di più la tensione c’è poi la musica di sottofondo, un motivetto incalzante che fa accapponare la pelle!\nCaratteristiche della slot\nBloodthirst è una slot con 5 rulli e 4 righe su cui sono disposte 10 linee di pagamento fisse. Il costo minimo di ogni partita è molto contenuto, 0,10 € a Spin, con una vincita massima di 10.000 volte la puntata. Si vince ogni qualvolta viene creata una combo di simboli adiacenti partendo dal primo rullo di sinistra.\nCi sono ben tre opzioni che velocizzano il gioco: Autoplay per far girare le bobine in modo automatico; Turbo, che accelera la caduta dei simboli; Super Turbo per giocate ancora più veloci.\nLa volatilità è alta, mentre il ritorno teorico è del 96,19%.\nCome si gioca a Bloodthirst\nLa Hacksaw Gaming ha impreziosito il gioco con un sistema di Bonus molto interessante. Prima però facciamo una veloce panoramica sui simboli, ricordando che per avere una stima precisa delle ricompense si può accedere al menù e da qui alla tabella dei pagamenti. I simboli di minor valore sono i reali, mentre i tre diversi vampiri pagano molto di più, arrivando a pagare 10 volte la scommessa in una combo di 5. Quando compaiono quattro mostri impilati, allora vedremo i simboli espandersi sull’intero rullo e dopo il pagamento delle vincite, assegnano dei premi extra. Se invece i simboli sono Mostro sono 5, verrà attivata la funzione Conquista dei mostri: tutte le bobine verranno riempite dal simbolo mostro e verrà pagata una somma compresa tra 100x e 2.500x. La stella rossa è il simbolo Wild e sostituisce tutti i simboli, oltre a essere pagante.\nLa stella FS è lo Scatter e attiva la funzione Bloodthirst, con dieci giri gratuiti e una più alta possibilità che atterrino mostri a espansione.\nCon 4 simboli Scatter verrà assegnata la funzione Immortal: avremo ancora 10 giri gratuiti, ma verrà scelto un solo mostro a espansione che resterà attivo durante l’intero Bonus. Con il simbolo «potenziamento», il simbolo speciale pagherà cifre più considerevoli.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nC’è possibilità di acquistare il gioco Bonus?\n\nSì, Bloodthirst offre questa possibilità pagando una cifra pari a 100 volte la puntata per la funzione Bloodthirst e 200 volte per la funzione Immortal.\n\n\n\nQual è la puntata minima per questa slot?\n\nSi parte da 0,01 € per linea di pagamento, quindi 0,10 € a Spin.\n\n\n\nDove posso trovare Bloodthirst?\n\nQuesta slot, uscita a febbraio 2023, è ormai presente in quasi tutti i casinò online legali.\n\n\n\n",

However, Bloodthirst breaks the norm with its gothic atmosphere, featuring symbols reminiscent of horror movies. This is evident from the main screen, with its bronze grid and a ghost village in the background with the roofs of houses lit by the full moon. The main symbols are various monsters, vampires, werewolves, and demons. The graphics are impressive, making the symbols quite intimidating, and coupled with the underlying music, it’s sure to send shivers down your spine.\n\nSlot Features\nBloodthirst has 5 reels and 4 rows, with 10 fixed pay lines. The minimum cost of each spin is quite low at €0.10, and the maximum win is 10,000 times the bet. You win by creating a combo of adjacent symbols starting from the first left reel. There are three options to speed up the game: Autoplay, Turbo, and Super Turbo, depending on how fast you want your game. The game has high volatility, with a theoretical return of 96.19%.\n\nPlaying Bloodthirst\nHacksaw Gaming has added an exciting Bonus system to the game. Minor symbols include card suits, while three different vampires pay much more, with a combo of five going for 10 times the bet. When four stacked monsters appear, the symbols expand on the entire reel, and after the payouts, the symbols pay extra prizes. If five monster symbols appear, the Monster Conquest function is activated, filling all reels with monster symbols and paying you between 100x and 2,500x. The red-star symbol is the Wild and replaces all symbols, while also paying. The FS star is the Scatter and activates the Bloodthirst function, giving you ten free spins with a higher chance of landing expanded monster symbols. Four scatter symbols award the Immortal function, with ten free spins and choosing one monster symbol to expand during the Bonus. With the Enhancement symbol, the special symbol pays a higher amount.\n\nFAQ\nCan I buy the Bonus feature in this game?\nYes, Bloodthirst offers this option by paying 100 times the bet for the Bloodthirst function and 200 times the bet for the Immortal function.\n\nWhat’s the minimum bet for this slot?\nThe game starts at €0.01 per pay line, so €0.10 per spin.\n\nWhere can I find Bloodthirst?\nThis slot game, released in February 2023, is now available in most legal online casinos.",

However, Bloodthirst is anything but a joke. It presents a gothic atmosphere, with symbols that seem like they've been lifted straight from a horror movie. The main screen is a bronze slab overlay with a ghost village backdrop, illuminated by the full moon. The main symbols are various monsters, vampires, werewolves, and demons. Their designs are enough to make one quiver, yet mesmerized by the superb graphics. The background music adds to the thrilling experience, with its pulsing rhythm that will give you goosebumps.\n\nSlot Features\nBloodthirst is a slot game that features five reels and four rows, with ten fixed paylines. The minimum cost of each spin is only 0.10 €, with a maximum payout of 10,000 times the bet. Winning combos are created with adjacent symbols that start from the first reel on the left. The game offers a range of options to hasten gameplay, including Autoplay, Turbo, and Super Turbo mode, allowing players to play more rapidly to their liking. The volatility is high, and the theoretical return is 96.19%.\n\nHow to Play Bloodthirst\nHacksaw Gaming has added an exciting bonus system to Bloodthirst. Before diving into the bonuses, let's take a quick glimpse at the game symbols. The real symbols are of minor value, while the three different vampires offer much higher payouts, up to ten times the wager in a 5-combo win. If four stacked monsters appear, we see the symbols expand to cover the entire reel, triggering extra prizes after paying out the wins. If there are five monster symbols, a feature called Monster Conquest will activate. All reels will be filled with the monster symbol, paying out between 100x to 2,500x. The red star symbol represents the Wild, capable of substituting all other symbols and adding payouts to the win. The FS star symbol is the Scatter, activating the Bloodthirst feature, awarding 10 free spins, and a higher chance of landing expanding monsters. With four Scatter symbols, the Immortal feature will trigger. Again, players receive 10 free spins, but only one expanding monster is chosen, remaining active throughout the bonus round. With the \"power-up\" symbol, the special symbol pays a more substantial amount.\n\nFAQs\nIs it possible to buy the bonus game in Bloodthirst?\n\nYes. Bloodthirst offers buying options at 100x the bet for the Bloodthirst feature and 200x for the Immortal feature.\n\nWhat is the minimum bet for this slot?\n\nThe minimum bet starts at 0.01 € per payline, which totals 0.10 € per spin.\n\nWhere can I find Bloodthirst?\n\nThis slot game was released in February 2023 and can currently be found in almost all legal online casinos.\n            ",

However, Bloodthirst is anything but a joke. It presents a gothic atmosphere, with symbols that seem like they've been lifted straight from a horror movie. The main screen is a bronze slab overlay with a ghost village backdrop, illuminated by the full moon. The main symbols are various monsters, vampires, werewolves, and demons. Their designs are enough to make one quiver, yet mesmerized by the superb graphics. The background music adds to the thrilling experience, with its pulsing rhythm that will give you goosebumps.\n\nSlot Features\nBloodthirst is a slot game that features five reels and four rows, with ten fixed paylines. The minimum cost of each spin is only 0.10 €, with a maximum payout of 10,000 times the bet. Winning combos are created with adjacent symbols that start from the first reel on the left. The game offers a range of options to hasten gameplay, including Autoplay, Turbo, and Super Turbo mode, allowing players to play more rapidly to their liking. The volatility is high, and the theoretical return is 96.19%.\n\nHow to Play Bloodthirst\nHacksaw Gaming has added an exciting bonus system to Bloodthirst. Before diving into the bonuses, let's take a quick glimpse at the game symbols. The real symbols are of minor value, while the three different vampires offer much higher payouts, up to ten times the wager in a 5-combo win. If four stacked monsters appear, we see the symbols expand to cover the entire reel, triggering extra prizes after paying out the wins. If there are five monster symbols, a feature called Monster Conquest will activate. All reels will be filled with the monster symbol, paying out between 100x to 2,500x. The red star symbol represents the Wild, capable of substituting all other symbols and adding payouts to the win. The FS star symbol is the Scatter, activating the Bloodthirst feature, awarding 10 free spins, and a higher chance of landing expanding monsters. With four Scatter symbols, the Immortal feature will trigger. Again, players receive 10 free spins, but only one expanding monster is chosen, remaining active throughout the bonus round. With the \"power-up\" symbol, the special symbol pays a more substantial amount.\n\nFAQs\nIs it possible to buy the bonus game in Bloodthirst?\n\nYes. Bloodthirst offers buying options at 100x the bet for the Bloodthirst feature and 200x for the Immortal feature.\n\nWhat is the minimum bet for this slot?\n\nThe minimum bet starts at 0.01 € per payline, which totals 0.10 € per spin.\n\nWhere can I find Bloodthirst?\n\nThis slot game was released in February 2023 and can currently be found in almost all legal online casinos.\n            ",

However, Bloodthirst is anything but a joke. It presents a gothic atmosphere, with symbols that seem like they've been lifted straight from a horror movie. The main screen is a bronze slab overlay with a ghost village backdrop, illuminated by the full moon. The main symbols are various monsters, vampires, werewolves, and demons. Their designs are enough to make one quiver, yet mesmerized by the superb graphics. The background music adds to the thrilling experience, with its pulsing rhythm that will give you goosebumps.\n\nSlot Features\nBloodthirst is a slot game that features five reels and four rows, with ten fixed paylines. The minimum cost of each spin is only 0.10 €, with a maximum payout of 10,000 times the bet. Winning combos are created with adjacent symbols that start from the first reel on the left. The game offers a range of options to hasten gameplay, including Autoplay, Turbo, and Super Turbo mode, allowing players to play more rapidly to their liking. The volatility is high, and the theoretical return is 96.19%.\n\nHow to Play Bloodthirst\nHacksaw Gaming has added an exciting bonus system to Bloodthirst. Before diving into the bonuses, let's take a quick glimpse at the game symbols. The real symbols are of minor value, while the three different vampires offer much higher payouts, up to ten times the wager in a 5-combo win. If four stacked monsters appear, we see the symbols expand to cover the entire reel, triggering extra prizes after paying out the wins. If there are five monster symbols, a feature called Monster Conquest will activate. All reels will be filled with the monster symbol, paying out between 100x to 2,500x. The red star symbol represents the Wild, capable of substituting all other symbols and adding payouts to the win. The FS star symbol is the Scatter, activating the Bloodthirst feature, awarding 10 free spins, and a higher chance of landing expanding monsters. With four Scatter symbols, the Immortal feature will trigger. Again, players receive 10 free spins, but only one expanding monster is chosen, remaining active throughout the bonus round. With the \"power-up\" symbol, the special symbol pays a more substantial amount.\n\nFAQs\nIs it possible to buy the bonus game in Bloodthirst?\n\nYes. Bloodthirst offers buying options at 100x the bet for the Bloodthirst feature and 200x for the Immortal feature.\n\nWhat is the minimum bet for this slot?\n\nThe minimum bet starts at 0.01 € per payline, which totals 0.10 € per spin.\n\nWhere can I find Bloodthirst?\n\nThis slot game was released in February 2023 and can currently be found in almost all legal online casinos.\n            ",
