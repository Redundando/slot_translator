La griglia di gioco si trova in fondo all’oceano, davanti a una roccia sottomarina e con un sub intento a scattare foto alle bellezze marine, che poi altro non sono che i simboli del nostro gioco. Altra caratteristica da sempre apprezzata da chi è pratico dei giochi della BGaming, la console ridotta all’essenziale, con pochi pulsanti e un menù interno molto ben fatto che ci permette di conoscere la tabella dei pagamenti e le opzioni di gioco. In termini di giocabilità, questa la scelta migliore perché il giocatore non è distratto da una miriade di informazione  aggiuntive e ha a disposizione un’intera schermata dedicata al gioco.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia di BGaming è quanto di più classico ci possa essere, con 5 rulli e 3 righe. Le linee di pagamento sono 15 e sono fisse. I giocatori più temerari possono alzare la posta sino a un massimo di 15 gettoni. Si vince quando si ottiene una combinazione vincente su una linea di pagamento. Vengono considerate combinazioni vincenti quelle formate da simboli adiacenti a partire dal rullo di sinistra e procedendo verso destra. Nel caso ci fossero più vincite su una stessa linea, verrà pagata soltanto la più alta, mentre con combinazioni paganti su diverse linee farà sì che le somme vengano sommate. Per quel che riguarda i giri automatici, possiamo impostarne da 10 a 1.000 o anche all’infinito. Niente paura, perché per bloccarli ci basterà cliccare di nuovo sul tasto Play oppure impostare determinati limiti soglia oltre i quali l’Autoplay si bloccherà.\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore, o RTP, invece è pari al 94%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nI simboli sono tutti a tema mare, come ad esempio gli anemoni di diversi colori hanno un basso valore, mentre con l’alga le somme iniziano a farsi interessanti. La medusa ricompensa abbastanza bene, così come la spugna gialla. La pianta verde fluorescente è comunque il simbolo che paga di più.\nPassiamo ora ai simboli speciali. Il Wild è il rullino fotografico, che sostituisce tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter. Inoltre, è un simbolo pagante. Per quel che riguarda lo Scatter, qui è rappresentato dalla macchina fotografica. Esso, oltre a regalare da 5 a 10 Free Spins, attiva una nuova funzione in cui le foto scattate nel fondo del mare divengono Wild, aumentando di molto le possibilità di vittoria.

As usual, the graphics developed by this software house are of a superior level, with meticulous attention to detail that will leave you amazed. The game board is located at the bottom of the ocean in front of an underwater rock, with a diver taking photos of marine wonders, which are the symbols of the game. Another feature always appreciated by those familiar with the games from BGaming is the minimal console, with only a few buttons and a well-made internal menu that allows us to know the paytable and game options. In terms of gameplay, this is the best choice because the player is not distracted by a myriad of additional information and has an entire screen dedicated to the game.\n\nSlot Features\n\nBGaming's game board is as classic as it gets, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 15 and fixed. More daring players can bet up to a maximum of 15 coins. You win when you get a winning combination on a payline. Winning combinations are considered those formed by adjacent symbols starting from the left reel and moving to the right. If there are multiple wins on the same line, only the highest will be paid out, while paying combinations on different lines will add up. As for automatic spins, we can set them from 10 to 1,000 or even infinite. No need to worry because to stop them we just need to click the Play button again or set certain threshold limits beyond which Autoplay will stop.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player, or RTP, is 94%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nThe symbols are all sea-themed. For example, anemones of different colors have a low value, while with seaweed, the sums start to get interesting. The jellyfish rewards quite well, as does the yellow sponge. However, the fluorescent green plant is the highest-paying symbol.\n\nNow let's move on to the special symbols. The Wild is the camera, which substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter. Additionally, it is a paying symbol. As for the Scatter, it is represented by the camera. In addition to awarding 5 to 10 Free Spins, it activates a new feature where photos taken at the bottom of the sea become Wild, greatly increasing the chances of winning. Free spins can be reactivated.",

The game is developed by BGaming provider, known for their superior graphics and attention to detail. Players can place a maximum bet of 15 coins per spin and win by getting a winning combination on a payline. The game offers Autoplay feature that can be set from 10 to 1,000 or even infinite number of automatic spins. The gameplay console is simple and minimalistic, providing players with essential buttons and a well-made internal menu to access the paytable and gaming options.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nDeep Sea has a beautifully designed game grid that is set at the bottom of the ocean with an underwater rock and a diver taking photos of marine life. The graphics are of superior quality, with immaculate attention to detail that leaves players in awe. The game is designed to be immersive, with the entire screen dedicated to the gameplay and no distractions from additional information.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nAll symbols in Deep Sea follow a sea-themed design with various colored anemones having a low value. The algae and jellyfish pay quite well, while the yellow sponge and fluorescent green plant symbols pay the most. The Wild symbol is the camera roll, which replaces all symbols except the Scatter symbol and is also a paying symbol. The Scatter symbol, represented by the camera, awards 5 to 10 Free Spins and activates a new function where photos taken in the depths of the sea become Wild, substantially increasing the chances of winning. The game offers 15 fixed paylines that pay for winning combinations formed by adjacent symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. In case of multiple wins on the same line, only the highest win is paid, while multiple paying combinations on different lines are added up.\n\nFree Spins and Wild symbols\n\nDeep Sea offers Free Spins that are triggered by the Scatter symbol and can be reactivated. During the Free Spins, photos taken in the depths of the sea become Wild, giving players even greater chances of winning. The Wild symbol, represented by the camera roll, replaces all other symbols except the Scatter symbol and is also a paying symbol. The Wild symbol significantly increases the chances of creating winning combinations.\n\nReturn to Player\n\nThe theoretical Return to Player (RTP) for Deep Sea is 94%, which indicates the average expected return that a player can expect over a long period of gameplay. The RTP is a measure of the percentage of stakes that a game returns to players over time, and it is lower than many other online slot games. However, this does not suggest that players cannot win significant payouts in Deep Sea. Players must be cautious with their bets as the game's volatility can result in high variance in payouts.\n\n        \n            ",

As usual, the graphics elaborated by this software house are of superior level, with manic attention to details that will leave you in awe. The game grid is located at the bottom of the ocean, in front of an underwater rock and with a diver taking photos of the marine beauties, which are nothing more than the symbols of our game. Another feature always appreciated by those who are experienced in BGaming's games is the essential console, with few buttons and a very well-made internal menu that allows us to know the paytable and gaming options. In terms of playability, this is the best choice because the player is not distracted by a myriad of additional information and has an entire screen dedicated to the game.\n\nSlot features\nBGaming's grid is as classic as it gets, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 15 and fixed. The bravest players can raise the stake up to a maximum of 15 coins. You win when you get a winning combination on a payline. Winning combinations are those formed by adjacent symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. In case there are multiple wins on the same line, only the highest will be paid, while with paying combinations on different lines, the amounts will be added up. As for automatic spins, we can set them from 10 to 1,000 or even infinite. No worries, because to stop them we just need to click on the Play button again or set certain threshold limits beyond which Autoplay will be locked.\n\nThe theoretical return to player, or RTP, is 94%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\nAll the symbols are sea-themed, such as the different colored anemones with a low value, while the sums start to become interesting with the algae. The jellyfish rewards quite well, as does the yellow sponge. However, the fluorescent green plant is the symbol that pays the most.\n\nNow let's move on to the special symbols. The Wild is the camera roll, which replaces all symbols except the Scatter. Furthermore, it is a paying symbol. As for the Scatter, it is represented here by the camera. It not only gives 5 to 10 Free Spins, but also activates a new function where the photos taken in the depths of the sea become Wild, greatly increasing the chances of winning. Free spins can be reactivated.\n            ",

As usual, the graphics elaborated by this software house are of superior level, with manic attention to details that will leave you in awe. The game grid is located at the bottom of the ocean, in front of an underwater rock and with a diver taking photos of the marine beauties, which are nothing more than the symbols of our game. Another feature always appreciated by those who are experienced in BGaming's games is the essential console, with few buttons and a very well-made internal menu that allows us to know the paytable and gaming options. In terms of playability, this is the best choice because the player is not distracted by a myriad of additional information and has an entire screen dedicated to the game.\n\nSlot features\nBGaming's grid is as classic as it gets, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are 15 and fixed. The bravest players can raise the stake up to a maximum of 15 coins. You win when you get a winning combination on a payline. Winning combinations are those formed by adjacent symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. In case there are multiple wins on the same line, only the highest will be paid, while with paying combinations on different lines, the amounts will be added up. As for automatic spins, we can set them from 10 to 1,000 or even infinite. No worries, because to stop them we just need to click on the Play button again or set certain threshold limits beyond which Autoplay will be locked.\n\nThe theoretical return to player, or RTP, is 94%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\nAll the symbols are sea-themed, such as the different colored anemones with a low value, while the sums start to become interesting with the algae. The jellyfish rewards quite well, as does the yellow sponge. However, the fluorescent green plant is the symbol that pays the most.\n\nNow let's move on to the special symbols. The Wild is the camera roll, which replaces all symbols except the Scatter. Furthermore, it is a paying symbol. As for the Scatter, it is represented here by the camera. It not only gives 5 to 10 Free Spins, but also activates a new function where the photos taken in the depths of the sea become Wild, greatly increasing the chances of winning. Free spins can be reactivated.\n            ",
