La macchinetta nasce con una struttura di gioco a 5 rulli e 20 linee di pagamento, pronta a offrire un tocco classico ma con grafica molto innovativa.

Come nella maggior parte dei giochi delle slot è possibile sbloccare delle vincite grazie a 3 o più simboli identici.

Scopriamo come, sfogliando le funzionalità scelte dal provider.\nLa grafica della slot Frost Queen Jackpots\nYggdrasil Gaming è quella casa di produzione che ci ha abituati molto bene negli anni: parliamo delle sue scelte grafiche e sonore che sono risultate molto azzeccate, curate e ideali per sviluppare al meglio il tema trattato nei suoi diversi titoli. Con Frost Queen Jackpots è stato ricreato un bellissimo mondo congelato, dove spiccano montagne innevate e un palazzo luminoso che nasconde tesori nascosti. Il tutto è perfettamente decorato con un accompagnamento musicale ad hoc, che riesce a rendere ottimale il tema fantasy. Ben curata è anche la scelta dei simboli di gioco che partono dai più bassi, ovvero le classiche carte da gioco reali da A a 10. Si passa poi alla corona, all’esploratore e un ciondolo. Chiaramente però la nostra regina del ghiaccio resta l’icona più redditizia di tutte, ed è capace di pagare fino a 3,5, 12,5 o 200 volte se appare rispettivamente 3, 4 o 5 volte su una linea di pagamento.\nFunzionalità speciali\nMa parliamo di funzioni extra, perché sono queste ad animare il gioco e intrattenere il giocatore. Troviamo per esempio il Magic Mirror, che si attiva quando il simbolo Scatter, lo specchio, si posiziona ovunque sui rulli: attribuisce una vincita da 50 o 500 volte la tua scommessa. Passiamo al Bonus degli scrigni, dove il giocatore deve scegliere i suoi tesori, con la possibilità di aggiudicarsi soldi oppure una o più chiavi: se sono dello stesso colore apri la serratura collegata.\nAggiungiamo poi i giri gratis che sono con un moltiplicatore 3x, abbinati alla possibilità di ottenere 1 dei 5 premi jackpot. E infine, con la Pick & Click Chest, che si attiva con 2 Scatter nello stesso giro, puoi giocare con gli scrigni e vincere una chiave casuale, un ingresso al game del Jackpot Free Spins e fino a 4 volte la tua scommessa.\nConsiderazioni finali su Frost Queen Jackpots\nIl quadro è chiaro: Frost Queen Jackpots è uno tra i più prestigiosi titoli di Yggdrasil Gaming, in prima linea per grafica e sonoro ma anche per modalità di giri ed esperienze offerte con le sue caratteristiche. Sicuramente il suo tema potrebbe non essere un prodotto da tutti, ma il gameplay sarà in grado di abbattere ogni barriera possibile, attirando sia i giocatori principianti che professionisti.

We're talking about the popular slot game created by Yggdrasil Gaming, which was undoubtedly inspired by the blockbuster cartoon. The game features a classic layout with innovative graphics, and a gameplay filled with bonuses, features, and surprising twists. Free spins accompanied by a 3x multiplier and the possibility of winning one of five progressive jackpots are among the bonuses. Like most slot games, winning combinations are created by landing three or more identical symbols. The game features an RTP of 96%, in line with market averages, and the chance to win up to 1,265 times your total bet on a single spin. Let's explore the features chosen by the provider.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nOver the years, Yggdrasil Gaming has proven to be a formidable company that excels in graphics and sound design. Frost Queen Jackpots recreated a beautiful frozen world, featuring snowy mountains and a bright palace hiding hidden treasures. The game's music perfectly complements its fantasy theme. The low-value symbols include the classic playing card values from Ace to 10, followed by a crown, an explorer, and a charm. The Ice Queen symbol is the most profitable and can pay out up to 3.5, 12.5 or 200 times your bet if it appears on a payline three, four, or five times.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nSpecial features keep the game interesting and entertaining. The Magic Mirror feature is activated when the Scatter symbol, the mirror, appears anywhere on the reels. It awards a payout of 50 or 500 times your bet. The Treasure Room Bonus involves selecting your treasures, with the opportunity to win money or one or more keys that open a connected lock. Free spins include a 3x multiplier, and you can win one of the five jackpot prizes. The Pick & Click Chest feature is activated by landing two Scatters in one spin. You can play with the chests and win a random key, access to the Jackpot Free Spins game, and up to four times your bet.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nFrost Queen Jackpots is one of Yggdrasil Gaming's most prestigious titles, featuring exceptional graphics, sound, and gameplay. The fantasy theme may not appeal to everyone, but the gameplay can attract both novice players and experienced gamblers alike. The fantastic setting will not disappoint. Give it a try and see for yourself!\n            ",
