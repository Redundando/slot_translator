Hot Spin Deluxe features all the classic Las Vegas style symbols you know and love, but now comes with not just one, but TWO new features to keep things fresh and exciting.</p>\n\n    <p>The first new feature, the Hot Spin Deluxe, randomly triggers during any regular spin and brings seven special features to life. It's like a box of chocolates – you never know what you're going to get (but trust us, it's all sweet). And the second new feature, the Hot Spin Deluxe Multiplier, adds a multiplier that goes up to x10 and can be applied to any Hot Spin feature. Who doesn't love a good multiplier?</p>\n\n    <p>With a medium-high volatility and a 96.0% RTP rate, this game is not for the faint of heart. But for those who dare to spin the reels, there's a range of classic casino symbols, from cherries to diamonds, that you'll be betting on. And speaking of betting, players can wager between €0.20 and €20.00 per spin.</p>\n\n    <p>But wait, there's more! There's a bonus symbol that triggers the Hot Spin Wheel and gives you up to 15 free spins that come with one of seven special features. Are you ready for Mystery Symbols, Random Wilds, Mega Reel, In-Sync Reels, Wild Reels, Super Wild Reels, and Ultra Reel? It's like a party in the deluxe version of Hot Spin, and everyone's invited. </p>\n\n    <p>Overall, Hot Spin Deluxe is the perfect blend of classic and modern and is sure to please both old and new fans of the game. And let's be real, who doesn't like a good upgrade? It's like getting a new phone, but with more flashing lights and ringing bells. So what are you waiting for? Give Hot Spin Deluxe a spin and see if you can handle the heat! </p>\"\n}"

Essentially, not much has changed; the same flashing lights and iconic symbols of a retro Las Vegas slot are present, with the addition of 2 extra features we'll review in this article.\nGameplay in full disco style!\nThanks to the soundtrack from the '70s and the golden glitter of the graphics, Hot Spin Deluxe will make you feel like you've been invited to a disco party with a Tutti Frutti theme! The setup is the same as the original: 5 reels, 3 rows, 20 fixed paylines that run fast, a medium-high volatility, and an RTP rate of 96.0%. Above the grid is the Hot Spin Reel, slowly spinning, just waiting for the right moment to start for real. First, choose your betting level between €0.20 and €20.00 per spin and get ready to learn all the tricks...\nFruity symbols, bonuses, and valuable features\n\nThe symbols of the Hot Spin slot without registration are the classics of this type of slot machine: cherries, lemons, plums, and watermelons, followed by bells, stars, 7s, and diamonds as the most valuable base symbol that is worth 25 times the bet for a combination of 5 of the same kind. The Golden W is the wild symbol that can replace any of the symbols on the paytable except the bonus symbol to form winning combinations. The Bonus symbol appears on reels 1, 3, and 5, and when 3 land, the Hot Spin Wheel bonus comes to life. When the Hot Spin Wheel stops, it assigns up to 15 free spins that include one of these special features: Mystery Symbols, Random Wilds, Mega Reel, In-Sync Reels, Wild Reels, Super Wild Reels, and finally Ultra Reel, which turns the entire grid into an ultra symbol.\n\nWhat are the 2 new features?\n\nHot Spin Deluxe - This feature randomly triggers the Hot Spin reel during any normal spin to bring one of the aforementioned features to life;\nHot Spin Deluxe Multiplier - This element goes up to x10 and can be applied to any Hot Spin feature.\n\nA successful and fun remake\nThe new slot Hot Spin Deluxe without download has an upgrade that fits well with fans of the original model and new players alike. The new maximum potential and additional multipliers have certainly brought improvements to this Deluxe version. This game will inevitably mark the end of the original Hot Spin slot, but fortunately, within our legally recognized online casinos by ADM, you can choose from a wide range of Tutti Frutti games to satisfy your retro style!\n            ",
