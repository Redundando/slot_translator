To trigger the autopay feature, select it and open the setup menu, which reveals a list of preset automatic spin options. Lucky players who land the lucky VS symbol twice on the reel-set will have the chance to fight one of the bosses. If the boss is defeated, their symbol becomes wild and remains so for the remaining free spins.\n\nThe game also comes with a more engaging free spins feature than usual. The number of free spins is determined when three, four, or five crystal skulls land on the reels. Players then get to punch the monster for each spin, with each hit counting as a spin. Three triggering symbols can award 10-20 free spins, four can give 15-30, and five can reward players with 25-50.\n\nOverall, Lilith's Inferno is a must-play slot game for experienced gamblers looking for thrilling gameplay, mesmerizing graphics, and big potential wins. If you're looking for similar games, try the Gorilla Slot from Novomatic or the popular Yggdrasil slot game set in a forest with demonic gorillas.\n        ",
