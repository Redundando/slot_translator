The image should be in a cartoon style and should feature a happy Maya warrior wearing glasses. The Maya warrior should be holding a dynamite stick and standing in front of a bank vault door while gangsters shoot their machine guns in the background. Use bright colors and bold outlines to make the image stand out and convey the high-energy and thrilling experience of playing this slot game. The image should make players curious and excited to try out Bomber Squad."
