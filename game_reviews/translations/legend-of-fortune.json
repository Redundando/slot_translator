            "response": "Legend of Fortune\n\nLooking for some adventure while playing an online slot game? Look no further than WMS' Legend of Fortune. Developed by Red 7 Mobile and distributed by SG Digital, this game was released in July 2018. As one of many great WMS free slots, this game will take you on an exploration of some of the ancient monuments of the Central American jungle. This five-reel, 20-payline slot offers a variety of bonus features to keep even the most intrepid explorers engaged.\n\nAn Exciting Graphical Experience\n\nFrom the start, Legend of Fortune prepares you for adventure, giving you a quick look at the features and wins on offer as the game loads, followed by an animation of a Lara Croft-style character running through ruins to reach a golden wheel. That won't be the last you'll see of her; if you're lucky enough to activate one of the bonus features, you'll guide her towards that wheel for one of the biggest wins.\n\nThis slot takes visual inspiration from adventure series like Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones, and its features are characterized by the dangers associated with those adventurers who explore ancient temples or defy the curses of ancient gods. The reels themselves are embedded in a stone structure, adorned with a simple decoration of a golden wheel encircled by stone petals in each corner. The symbols that the reels carry depict weapons and gods tied to the ancient civilizations of Central America, various creatures that can be found in the surrounding rainforests, and objects that can be found in an adventurer's backpack.\n\nThe colorful symbols and bonus screens will transport you to a semi-cartoon-style burial adventure, and the bonus features are well integrated into the theme. The game images tend more towards fantasy than an accurate reproduction of scenes and artifacts from a single people or civilization. However, much care and attention have been taken to ensure that the details of each symbol and each scene are reproduced well enough to be recognized as artifacts of real-life objects from numerous cultures and all the times in which they lived.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThere's a surprise bonus in store for you during the base game, if you're lucky, and it's a bonus for which you won't need a scatter. Make sure to look out for the Wild Walls. They can start closing in on you at any time during the game! They begin by crushing reel 5, pushing it until the entire reel turns wild. Then you get another free spin with the wild reel locked in place, and if there's no win, the walls will start closing in further. Gradually, reels 1, 2, and 4 will be overtaken with expanding wild reels until there's a win, or when the compression walls finally meet in the middle.\n\nNow let's talk about the scatter. Three Zapotec urns will give you access to the bonus feature selector, where an ancient god guards the entrance to three passages, flanked by two lit torches. Whichever passage you choose will take you to one of three bonuses. These bonuses are the Temple Escape Free Spins, the Tumbling Free Spins, and the Stepping Stones Bonus.\n\nIf you're ready to flee the temple, you'll need to be prepared to overcome the Wild Darts, Crushing Spikes, and the Pit of Wealth. Luckily, you'll start with eight free spins. If you successfully overcome them all, you'll get two more free spins. Don't worry, the traps aren't bad news. Being hit by flying wild darts is a good thing because every symbol that gets hit is turned wild. If you trigger the crushing spikes during your journey, they'll do the same; any symbol they launch will also turn wild. If the Pit of Wealth opens up, symbols can fall into it and be replaced by a giant, random symbol for wins. Our loading screen adventurer returns as one of the symbols. She'll only appear on reel 5, but when she does, she'll help you overcome any trap.\n\nChoose Tumbling Wilds, and you'll start with 10 free spins. Escape the collapse as the symbols tumble down like stone blocks while they spin. Any symbols on winning lines will explode, causing the blocks above them to fall directly into the empty spaces. This means that you can get more wins from every spin. Once the wins stop, the symbols are replaced with the next free spin.\n\nLast but not least, there's the Stepping Stones Bonus. Our intrepid adventurer has returned, and it's your job to guide her to the final stone and collect multipliers along the way. Every time you successfully pass a bonus stone, your multiplier prize increases.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nAre you a fan of breathtaking adventures and mysterious treasure hunts? Then try Microgaming's Tomb Raider 2: The Secret of the Sword, or perhaps NetEnt's Gonzo's Quest to quench your thirst for winning expeditions.",

Look no further than WMS' Legend of Fortune. Developed by Red 7 Mobile and distributed by SG Digital, this game was released in July 2018. As one of many great WMS free slots, this game will take you on an exploration of some of the ancient monuments of the Central American jungle. This five-reel, 20-payline slot offers a variety of bonus features to keep even the most intrepid explorers engaged.\n\nAn Exciting Graphical Experience\n\nFrom the start, Legend of Fortune prepares you for adventure, giving you a quick look at the features and wins on offer as the game loads, followed by an animation of a Lara Croft-style character running through ruins to reach a golden wheel. That won't be the last you'll see of her; if you're lucky enough to activate one of the bonus features, you'll guide her towards that wheel for one of the biggest wins.\n\nThis slot takes visual inspiration from adventure series like Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones, and its features are characterized by the dangers associated with those adventurers who explore ancient temples or defy the curses of ancient gods. The reels themselves are embedded in a stone structure, adorned with a simple decoration of a golden wheel encircled by stone petals in each corner. The symbols that the reels carry depict weapons and gods tied to the ancient civilizations of Central America, various creatures that can be found in the surrounding rainforests, and objects that can be found in an adventurer's backpack.\n\nThe colorful symbols and bonus screens will transport you to a semi-cartoon-style burial adventure, and the bonus features are well integrated into the theme. The game images tend more towards fantasy than an accurate reproduction of scenes and artifacts from a single people or civilization. However, much care and attention have been taken to ensure that the details of each symbol and each scene are reproduced well enough to be recognized as artifacts of real-life objects from numerous cultures and all the times in which they lived.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThere's a surprise bonus in store for you during the base game, if you're lucky, and it's a bonus for which you won't need a scatter. Make sure to look out for the Wild Walls. They can start closing in on you at any time during the game! They begin by crushing reel 5, pushing it until the entire reel turns wild. Then you get another free spin with the wild reel locked in place, and if there's no win, the walls will start closing in further. Gradually, reels 1, 2, and 4 will be overtaken with expanding wild reels until there's a win, or when the compression walls finally meet in the middle.\n\nNow let's talk about the scatter. Three Zapotec urns will give you access to the bonus feature selector, where an ancient god guards the entrance to three passages, flanked by two lit torches. Whichever passage you choose will take you to one of three bonuses. These bonuses are the Temple Escape Free Spins, the Tumbling Free Spins, and the Stepping Stones Bonus.\n\nIf you're ready to flee the temple, you'll need to be prepared to overcome the Wild Darts, Crushing Spikes, and the Pit of Wealth. Luckily, you'll start with eight free spins. If you successfully overcome them all, you'll get two more free spins. Don't worry, the traps aren't bad news. Being hit by flying wild darts is a good thing because every symbol that gets hit is turned wild. If you trigger the crushing spikes during your journey, they'll do the same; any symbol they launch will also turn wild. If the Pit of Wealth opens up, symbols can fall into it and be replaced by a giant, random symbol for wins. Our loading screen adventurer returns as one of the symbols. She'll only appear on reel 5, but when she does, she'll help you overcome any trap.\n\nChoose Tumbling Wilds, and you'll start with 10 free spins. Escape the collapse as the symbols tumble down like stone blocks while they spin. Any symbols on winning lines will explode, causing the blocks above them to fall directly into the empty spaces. This means that you can get more wins from every spin. Once the wins stop, the symbols are replaced with the next free spin.\n\nLast but not least, there's the Stepping Stones Bonus. Our intrepid adventurer has returned, and it's your job to guide her to the final stone and collect multipliers along the way. Every time you successfully pass a bonus stone, your multiplier prize increases.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nAre you a fan of breathtaking adventures and mysterious treasure hunts? Then try Microgaming's Tomb Raider 2: The Secret of the Sword, or perhaps NetEnt's Gonzo's Quest to quench your thirst for winning expeditions.\n        ",

Look no further than WMS' Legend of Fortune. Developed by Red 7 Mobile and distributed by SG Digital, this game was released in July 2018. As one of many great WMS free slots, this game will take you on an exploration of some of the ancient monuments of the Central American jungle. This five-reel, 20-payline slot offers a variety of bonus features to keep even the most intrepid explorers engaged.\n\nAn Exciting Graphical Experience\n\nFrom the start, Legend of Fortune prepares you for adventure, giving you a quick look at the features and wins on offer as the game loads, followed by an animation of a Lara Croft-style character running through ruins to reach a golden wheel. That won't be the last you'll see of her; if you're lucky enough to activate one of the bonus features, you'll guide her towards that wheel for one of the biggest wins.\n\nThis slot takes visual inspiration from adventure series like Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones, and its features are characterized by the dangers associated with those adventurers who explore ancient temples or defy the curses of ancient gods. The reels themselves are embedded in a stone structure, adorned with a simple decoration of a golden wheel encircled by stone petals in each corner. The symbols that the reels carry depict weapons and gods tied to the ancient civilizations of Central America, various creatures that can be found in the surrounding rainforests, and objects that can be found in an adventurer's backpack.\n\nThe colorful symbols and bonus screens will transport you to a semi-cartoon-style burial adventure, and the bonus features are well integrated into the theme. The game images tend more towards fantasy than an accurate reproduction of scenes and artifacts from a single people or civilization. However, much care and attention have been taken to ensure that the details of each symbol and each scene are reproduced well enough to be recognized as artifacts of real-life objects from numerous cultures and all the times in which they lived.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThere's a surprise bonus in store for you during the base game, if you're lucky, and it's a bonus for which you won't need a scatter. Make sure to look out for the Wild Walls. They can start closing in on you at any time during the game! They begin by crushing reel 5, pushing it until the entire reel turns wild. Then you get another free spin with the wild reel locked in place, and if there's no win, the walls will start closing in further. Gradually, reels 1, 2, and 4 will be overtaken with expanding wild reels until there's a win, or when the compression walls finally meet in the middle.\n\nNow let's talk about the scatter. Three Zapotec urns will give you access to the bonus feature selector, where an ancient god guards the entrance to three passages, flanked by two lit torches. Whichever passage you choose will take you to one of three bonuses. These bonuses are the Temple Escape Free Spins, the Tumbling Free Spins, and the Stepping Stones Bonus.\n\nIf you're ready to flee the temple, you'll need to be prepared to overcome the Wild Darts, Crushing Spikes, and the Pit of Wealth. Luckily, you'll start with eight free spins. If you successfully overcome them all, you'll get two more free spins. Don't worry, the traps aren't bad news. Being hit by flying wild darts is a good thing because every symbol that gets hit is turned wild. If you trigger the crushing spikes during your journey, they'll do the same; any symbol they launch will also turn wild. If the Pit of Wealth opens up, symbols can fall into it and be replaced by a giant, random symbol for wins. Our loading screen adventurer returns as one of the symbols. She'll only appear on reel 5, but when she does, she'll help you overcome any trap.\n\nChoose Tumbling Wilds, and you'll start with 10 free spins. Escape the collapse as the symbols tumble down like stone blocks while they spin. Any symbols on winning lines will explode, causing the blocks above them to fall directly into the empty spaces. This means that you can get more wins from every spin. Once the wins stop, the symbols are replaced with the next free spin.\n\nLast but not least, there's the Stepping Stones Bonus. Our intrepid adventurer has returned, and it's your job to guide her to the final stone and collect multipliers along the way. Every time you successfully pass a bonus stone, your multiplier prize increases.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nAre you a fan of breathtaking adventures and mysterious treasure hunts? Then try Microgaming's Tomb Raider 2: The Secret of the Sword, or perhaps NetEnt's Gonzo's Quest to quench your thirst for winning expeditions.\n            ",

Its features are characterized by the dangers associated with adventurers who explore ancient temples or defy the curses of ancient gods.\n\nGameplay Features and Bonuses\n\nDuring the base game, there is a surprise bonus called Wild Walls, and if players are lucky, they can experience a compression effect allowing them to win big. The scatter symbol, triggered by three Zapotec urns, give players access to the bonus feature selector that gives players access to three bonuses: Temple Escape Free Spins, Tumbling Free Spins, and Stepping Stones Bonus.\n\nGraphics and Immersion\n\nLegend of Fortune seamlessly blends cartoonish graphics with the adventurous theme. Players are transported to an immersive semi-cartoon-style burial adventure, and the bonus features are well integrated into the game's theme. The game images tend more toward fantasy than toward an accurate reproduction of scenes and artifacts from a single people or civilization.\n\nComparison to Similar Games\n\nFor those who enjoy adventurous themed slots, Legend of Fortune fits the bill. Other online slot games with similar themes include Microgaming's Tomb Raider 2: The Secret of the Sword and NetEnt's Gonzo's Quest.\n\nPaylines and Reels\n\nLegend of Fortune has five reels and 20 paylines, providing ample opportunities for players to land winning combinations.\n\nDeveloper and Distributor Information\n\nLegend of Fortune was developed by Red 7 Mobile and distributed by SG Digital.

Look no further than WMS' Legend of Fortune. Developed by Red 7 Mobile and distributed by SG Digital, this game was released in July 2018. As one of many great WMS free slots, this game will take you on an exploration of some of the ancient monuments of the Central American jungle. This five-reel, 20-payline slot offers a variety of bonus features to keep even the most intrepid explorers engaged.\n\nAn Exciting Graphical Experience\n\nFrom the start, Legend of Fortune prepares you for adventure, giving you a quick look at the features and wins on offer as the game loads, followed by an animation of a Lara Croft-style character running through ruins to reach a golden wheel. That won't be the last you'll see of her; if you're lucky enough to activate one of the bonus features, you'll guide her towards that wheel for one of the biggest wins.\n\nThis slot takes visual inspiration from adventure series like Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones, and its features are characterized by the dangers associated with those adventurers who explore ancient temples or defy the curses of ancient gods. The reels themselves are embedded in a stone structure, adorned with a simple decoration of a golden wheel encircled by stone petals in each corner. The symbols that the reels carry depict weapons and gods tied to the ancient civilizations of Central America, various creatures that can be found in the surrounding rainforests, and objects that can be found in an adventurer's backpack.\n\nThe colorful symbols and bonus screens will transport you to a semi-cartoon-style burial adventure, and the bonus features are well integrated into the theme. The game images tend more towards fantasy than an accurate reproduction of scenes and artifacts from a single people or civilization. However, much care and attention have been taken to ensure that the details of each symbol and each scene are reproduced well enough to be recognized as artifacts of real-life objects from numerous cultures and all the times in which they lived.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThere's a surprise bonus in store for you during the base game, if you're lucky, and it's a bonus for which you won't need a scatter. Make sure to look out for the Wild Walls. They can start closing in on you at any time during the game! They begin by crushing reel 5, pushing it until the entire reel turns wild. Then you get another free spin with the wild reel locked in place, and if there's no win, the walls will start closing in further. Gradually, reels 1, 2, and 4 will be overtaken with expanding wild reels until there's a win, or when the compression walls finally meet in the middle.\n\nNow let's talk about the scatter. Three Zapotec urns will give you access to the bonus feature selector, where an ancient god guards the entrance to three passages, flanked by two lit torches. Whichever passage you choose will take you to one of three bonuses. These bonuses are the Temple Escape Free Spins, the Tumbling Free Spins, and the Stepping Stones Bonus.\n\nIf you're ready to flee the temple, you'll need to be prepared to overcome the Wild Darts, Crushing Spikes, and the Pit of Wealth. Luckily, you'll start with eight free spins. If you successfully overcome them all, you'll get two more free spins. Don't worry, the traps aren't bad news. Being hit by flying wild darts is a good thing because every symbol that gets hit is turned wild. If you trigger the crushing spikes during your journey, they'll do the same; any symbol they launch will also turn wild. If the Pit of Wealth opens up, symbols can fall into it and be replaced by a giant, random symbol for wins. Our loading screen adventurer returns as one of the symbols. She'll only appear on reel 5, but when she does, she'll help you overcome any trap.\n\nChoose Tumbling Wilds, and you'll start with 10 free spins. Escape the collapse as the symbols tumble down like stone blocks while they spin. Any symbols on winning lines will explode, causing the blocks above them to fall directly into the empty spaces. This means that you can get more wins from every spin. Once the wins stop, the symbols are replaced with the next free spin.\n\nLast but not least, there's the Stepping Stones Bonus. Our intrepid adventurer has returned, and it's your job to guide her to the final stone and collect multipliers along the way. Every time you successfully pass a bonus stone, your multiplier prize increases.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nAre you a fan of breathtaking adventures and mysterious treasure hunts? Then try Microgaming's Tomb Raider 2: The Secret of the Sword, or perhaps NetEnt's Gonzo's Quest to quench your thirst for winning expeditions.\n            ",

Look no further than WMS' Legend of Fortune. Developed by Red 7 Mobile and distributed by SG Digital, this game was released in July 2018. As one of many great WMS free slots, this game will take you on an exploration of some of the ancient monuments of the Central American jungle. This five-reel, 20-payline slot offers a variety of bonus features to keep even the most intrepid explorers engaged.\n\nAn Exciting Graphical Experience\n\nFrom the start, Legend of Fortune prepares you for adventure, giving you a quick look at the features and wins on offer as the game loads, followed by an animation of a Lara Croft-style character running through ruins to reach a golden wheel. That won't be the last you'll see of her; if you're lucky enough to activate one of the bonus features, you'll guide her towards that wheel for one of the biggest wins.\n\nThis slot takes visual inspiration from adventure series like Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones, and its features are characterized by the dangers associated with those adventurers who explore ancient temples or defy the curses of ancient gods. The reels themselves are embedded in a stone structure, adorned with a simple decoration of a golden wheel encircled by stone petals in each corner. The symbols that the reels carry depict weapons and gods tied to the ancient civilizations of Central America, various creatures that can be found in the surrounding rainforests, and objects that can be found in an adventurer's backpack.\n\nThe colorful symbols and bonus screens will transport you to a semi-cartoon-style burial adventure, and the bonus features are well integrated into the theme. The game images tend more towards fantasy than an accurate reproduction of scenes and artifacts from a single people or civilization. However, much care and attention have been taken to ensure that the details of each symbol and each scene are reproduced well enough to be recognized as artifacts of real-life objects from numerous cultures and all the times in which they lived.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThere's a surprise bonus in store for you during the base game, if you're lucky, and it's a bonus for which you won't need a scatter. Make sure to look out for the Wild Walls. They can start closing in on you at any time during the game! They begin by crushing reel 5, pushing it until the entire reel turns wild. Then you get another free spin with the wild reel locked in place, and if there's no win, the walls will start closing in further. Gradually, reels 1, 2, and 4 will be overtaken with expanding wild reels until there's a win, or when the compression walls finally meet in the middle.\n\nNow let's talk about the scatter. Three Zapotec urns will give you access to the bonus feature selector, where an ancient god guards the entrance to three passages, flanked by two lit torches. Whichever passage you choose will take you to one of three bonuses. These bonuses are the Temple Escape Free Spins, the Tumbling Free Spins, and the Stepping Stones Bonus.\n\nIf you're ready to flee the temple, you'll need to be prepared to overcome the Wild Darts, Crushing Spikes, and the Pit of Wealth. Luckily, you'll start with eight free spins. If you successfully overcome them all, you'll get two more free spins. Don't worry, the traps aren't bad news. Being hit by flying wild darts is a good thing because every symbol that gets hit is turned wild. If you trigger the crushing spikes during your journey, they'll do the same; any symbol they launch will also turn wild. If the Pit of Wealth opens up, symbols can fall into it and be replaced by a giant, random symbol for wins. Our loading screen adventurer returns as one of the symbols. She'll only appear on reel 5, but when she does, she'll help you overcome any trap.\n\nChoose Tumbling Wilds, and you'll start with 10 free spins. Escape the collapse as the symbols tumble down like stone blocks while they spin. Any symbols on winning lines will explode, causing the blocks above them to fall directly into the empty spaces. This means that you can get more wins from every spin. Once the wins stop, the symbols are replaced with the next free spin.\n\nLast but not least, there's the Stepping Stones Bonus. Our intrepid adventurer has returned, and it's your job to guide her to the final stone and collect multipliers along the way. Every time you successfully pass a bonus stone, your multiplier prize increases.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nAre you a fan of breathtaking adventures and mysterious treasure hunts? Then try Microgaming's Tomb Raider 2: The Secret of the Sword, or perhaps NetEnt's Gonzo's Quest to quench your thirst for winning expeditions.\n        ",
