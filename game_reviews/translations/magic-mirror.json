The problem is that, associated with a very low variance, it makes Magic Mirror a slot where, yes, there are quite regular and frequent wins, but rather small ones. \nRegarding gameplay, it is not very complex, with the presence of only one special symbol that acts as both Wild and Scatter, and bonus games that do not offer generous wins. \nThe graphics are well cared for but rather minimalist: there are only four themed symbols, while for the others, traditional playing cards from 10 to Ace are used. \nOverall, we do not feel like completely rejecting this slot machine but neither promoting it with flying colors. However, it could be interesting to play it before trying the more recent versions, improved both from a graphic and gameplay point of view. \n\nMagic Mirror symbols\nWe have already mentioned the presence of playing cards from 10 to Ace, in addition to these we find four themed symbols, represented by a book, a magic ring, a unicorn, and a princess who should be a sort of Snow White, since the game is inspired by the famous fairy tale's magic mirror. \nThis is the Magic Mirror payout table: \n\nThe Princess: up to 100 coins \nThe Unicorn: pays 40 coins if it appears five times \nThe book and the ring: earn a maximum win of 15 coins \nAce and K: pay up to 3 coins and you win only with alignments starting from 3 symbols \n10, J, and Q: pay 2 coins if they appear on all 5 reels, 0.50 on 4 and 0.10 on three. \n\nWild and Scatter\nIn this slot machine, Wild and Scatter are represented by a single symbol, namely the Magic Mirror. \nAs a Wild, the Magic Mirror acts as a Joker, replacing the other symbols to obtain a winning alignment. Moreover, if it appears at least three times on the reels, it allows you to win both 0.40 coins and 10 free spins. \nIn the free spins, a random expandable special symbol will then be assigned, which, if it appears on a reel, expands to cover them all. \nThere are finally two mini-games: the first is a classic card game where you have to guess the color, the second is represented by a scale on which you have to climb, earning steps thanks to the launch of a coin. \nThe bonus games make the slot more interesting, although even these do not allow particularly significant wins.\n            ",

It has 5 reels and 20 paylines, with a minimum bet of €0.01 and a maximum bet of €100. This slot game is a good option for those who are new to the world of slot machines.\n\nFeatures and gameplay\n\nMagic Mirror has an RTP of 95.94%, which is not very high compared to other slots on the market. The variance is low, making the wins frequent but small. The game has simple gameplay, with only one special symbol that acts as both Wild and Scatter and bonus games that do not offer generous wins.\n\nSymbols and cards\n\nThere are four themed symbols in Magic Mirror, represented by a book, a magic ring, a unicorn, and a princess. The playing cards from 10 to Ace are also present in the game. The payouts for the symbols range from 2 to 100 coins.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nThe graphics of Magic Mirror are well-crafted, although minimalist. There are only four themed symbols, and the traditional playing cards from 10 to Ace are used for the other symbols. The overall design creates a fairy tale atmosphere, fitting with the game's theme.\n\nBonus games and free spins\n\nMagic Mirror has two bonus games: a classic card game and a coin toss game. The free spins feature is triggered by landing at least three Magic Mirror symbols on the reels. Players receive 10 free spins and a random special symbol that expands to cover the entire reel. Although the bonus games add excitement to the game, the wins are not significant.\n\n        \n            ",

The game has a minimum bet of €0.01 and a maximum bet of €100. The Return To Player (RTP) is 95.94%, which is below average, and the variance is low, which means small but frequent wins. The graphics are minimalist, with only four themed symbols and traditional playing cards used for the rest. Overall, the game may appeal to beginners, but it falls short of impressing experienced players.\n\nGameplay Features and Mechanics\n\nMagic Mirror is a relatively simple slot game with only one special symbol that serves as both Wild and Scatter. The bonus games do not offer generous wins. However, the game has a random special symbol that can expand and cover all reels in the free spins round. There are also two mini-games, a classic card game and a coin toss game that adds some interest to the gameplay.\n\nPayline and Betting Options\n\nMagic Mirror has 20 paylines with a minimum bet of €0.01 and a maximum bet of €100. Players can adjust their bets easily using the controls on the game screen.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nThe Magic Mirror symbol serves as both Wild and Scatter in this game. As a Wild, the Magic Mirror replaces other symbols to create winning combinations. If it appears at least three times on the reels, it also triggers 10 free spins and a chance to win 0.40 coins. During the free spins round, a random special symbol can expand and cover all reels, increasing the chances of winning.\n\nBonus Games and Free Spins\n\nMagic Mirror has two mini-games, a classic card game, and a coin toss game. Both games offer a chance to earn additional winnings. In the free spins round, players have a chance to win even more thanks to the random special symbol that can expand and increase the chances of winning. However, the bonus games and free spins do not offer particularly significant wins.\n\n        \n            ",

The problem is that, associated with a very low variance, it makes Magic Mirror a slot where, yes, there are quite regular and frequent wins, but rather small ones. \nRegarding gameplay, it is not very complex, with the presence of only one special symbol that acts as both Wild and Scatter, and bonus games that do not offer generous wins. \nThe graphics are well cared for but rather minimalist: there are only four themed symbols, while for the others, traditional playing cards from 10 to Ace are used. \nOverall, we do not feel like completely rejecting this slot machine but neither promoting it with flying colors. However, it could be interesting to play it before trying the more recent versions, improved both from a graphic and gameplay point of view. \n\nMagic Mirror symbols\nWe have already mentioned the presence of playing cards from 10 to Ace, in addition to these we find four themed symbols, represented by a book, a magic ring, a unicorn, and a princess who should be a sort of Snow White, since the game is inspired by the famous fairy tale's magic mirror. \nThis is the Magic Mirror payout table: \n\nThe Princess: up to 100 coins \nThe Unicorn: pays 40 coins if it appears five times \nThe book and the ring: earn a maximum win of 15 coins \nAce and K: pay up to 3 coins and you win only with alignments starting from 3 symbols \n10, J, and Q: pay 2 coins if they appear on all 5 reels, 0.50 on 4 and 0.10 on three. \n\nWild and Scatter\nIn this slot machine, Wild and Scatter are represented by a single symbol, namely the Magic Mirror. \nAs a Wild, the Magic Mirror acts as a Joker, replacing the other symbols to obtain a winning alignment. Moreover, if it appears at least three times on the reels, it allows you to win both 0.40 coins and 10 free spins. \nIn the free spins, a random expandable special symbol will then be assigned, which, if it appears on a reel, expands to cover them all. \nThere are finally two mini-games: the first is a classic card game where you have to guess the color, the second is represented by a scale on which you have to climb, earning steps thanks to the launch of a coin. \nThe bonus games make the slot more interesting, although even these do not allow particularly significant wins.\n            ",

Moreover, if it appears at least three times on the reels, it allows you to win both 0.40 coins and 10 free spins. \nIn the free spins, a random expandable special symbol will then be assigned, which, if it appears on a reel, expands to cover them all. \nThere are finally two mini-games: the first is a classic card game where you have to guess the color, the second is represented by a scale on which you have to climb, earning steps thanks to the launch of a coin. \nThe bonus games make the slot more interesting, although even these do not allow particularly significant wins.\n        ",
