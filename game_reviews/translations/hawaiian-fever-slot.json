The layout is made up of 3 rows and 3 reels, but the developers have included 27 possible ways to win, an interesting move for such a small grid. \n\nTo form a win, 3 matching symbols must land on those paylines, starting from the leftmost reel. As for betting options, Hawaiian Fever slot includes a wide range of options that can suit most types of players. \n\nThe minimum bet is set at €0.20, while the maximum possible bet can be €100 per spin.\nTheme and Design\nThe typically tropical Hawaiian mood is perfectly represented in the graphics, as well as in the soundtrack that plays traditional music of the region. The wooden reels of the Hawaiian Fever slot are in the center of the screen, while the background features a beautiful landscape with tropical plants, beach huts, palm trees, and of course, surfboards.\nSymbols and Payouts \nThe symbols have a rather distinctive design and the paytable starts with the 4 lower-value card suits. Moving on to the more rewarding symbols, there's a pineapple drink, a coconut drink, and finally a watermelon drink that's worth 25 times the bet for a fully-covered payline.\nThe Hawaiian girl is the game's wild symbol, which can expand and replace the normal paying symbols in winning combinations. The Aloha flower symbol is the scatter and can be used to trigger the free spins feature.\nThe RTP is average (95.04%), while the volatility is high, meaning that prizes can be less frequent but considerably more valuable if they do come.

That symbol will expand to cover the entire reel and be locked in place, while the other positions will start spinning again;\n\nGAMBLE FEATURE\nAfter creating a winning combination, you can choose to gamble your winnings for a chance to increase your bankroll. You'll need to correctly guess the color of a face-down card, and in case of an error, the game will be canceled.\n\nFinal Evaluation and Verdict\nIf you love the sea and exotic destinations, Hawaiian Fever slot can be a fantastic gaming experience as it combines excellent graphics and simple but entertaining gameplay. The Hawaiian scene presented in the background and symbols is fantastic and the bonus features can be potentially profitable. \n\nHowever, there is a below-average RTP and the potential maximum win can be considered relatively low for such a highly volatile game. \n\nIf you want to try more titles from this developer, we suggest taking a look at our free slot catalog and choosing your favorite or trying the fun Wheel of Fortune Hawaiian Getaway by IGT for another relaxing vacation!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions \nWhat's the maximum potential win in the Hawaiian Fever slot?\n\nThe maximum potential win in the Hawaiian Fever slot can reach up to 1,860 times your bet.\n\nWhat type of bonuses are included in the Hawaiian Fever online slot?\n\nThe Hawaiian Fever slot is equipped with Expanding Wilds, Waikiki Respins and a Free Spins bonus round that will help you increase potential wins.\n\nIs the Hawaiian Fever slot mobile-friendly?\n\nYes, the Hawaiian Fever slot was created by Tom Horn Gaming with HTML5 technology, making it compatible with smartphones and tablets.",

There is a potential maximum reward of up to 1,860 times the bet, so keep reading this review to learn all the details.\n\nHawaiian Fever Slot: How to Play \n\nIn terms of gameplay, the Hawaiian Fever slot has a rather straightforward approach. The layout consists of 3 rows and 3 reels, but the developers have included 27 possible ways to win, an interesting move given the reduced grid.\n\nTo form a win, 3 matching symbols must land on those paylines, starting from the first reel on the left. As for betting options, the Hawaiian Fever slot includes a wide range of options that can adapt to most types of players.\n\nThe starting option is set at €0.20, while the maximum bet possible can be €100 per spin.\n\nTheme and Design \n\nThe typical tropical Hawaiian mood is perfectly represented both in the graphics and in the soundtrack that picks up traditional music from the places. The wooden reels of the Hawaiian Fever slot are in the center of the screen and on the background there is a wonderful landscape with tropical plants, beach huts, palm trees, and the inevitable surfboards.\n\nSymbols and Payout \n\nThe symbols have a rather characteristic design and the payment table starts with the 4 low-value card suits. Moving on to the most lucrative symbols, there is a pineapple drink, a coconut drink, and finally a watermelon drink that is worth 25 times the bet for a fully covered payline. \n\nThe Hawaiian girl is the game's wild symbol that can expand and replace normal pay symbols in winning combinations. The Aloha flower symbol is the scatter and can be used to activate the free spins feature.\n\nThe RTP is average (95.04%), while volatility is high, which means that prizes can be less frequent but considerably more valuable if they arrive. This model is combined with a maximum potential win of up to 1,860 times the bet.\n\nBonus Features in Gameplay \n\nNow that we have explained the basics, it's time to take a look at the bonus features included in the Hawaiian Fever slot and how they can influence gameplay.\n\nEXPANDING WILD FEATURE \n\nDuring the base game, whenever a wild symbol stops on the reels and can take part in a winning combination, it will expand. In this case, the wild symbol will cover the entire reel, accompanied by dance animations and flowers.\n\nFREE SPIN FEATURE \n\nIf you manage to get 3 scatter symbols at the same time, the Free Spins bonus round will be activated and you will be awarded 10 FS while admiring a beautiful sunset in the background.\n\nWAIKIKI RESPIN FEATURE \n\nDuring the Free Spins feature, landing the special Hawaiian girl symbol will award you a Waikiki Respin. That symbol will expand to cover the entire reel and will be locked, while the other positions will start spinning again.\n\nGAMBLE FEATURE \n\nAfter creating a winning combination, you can choose to bet with your winnings to have a chance to increase your bankroll. You will have to correctly guess the color of a face-down card and if you make a mistake, the game will be canceled.\n\nFinal Evaluation and Verdict \n\nIf you love the sea and exotic destinations, the Hawaiian Fever slot can be a fantastic gaming experience as it combines excellent graphics and simple but entertaining gameplay. The Hawaiian scene presented with the background and symbols is fantastic, and the bonus features can be potentially profitable.\n\nHowever, there is an RTP below average and the maximum potential win can be considered relatively low for a highly volatile game like this.\n\nIf you want to try other titles from this developer, we suggest you take a look at our catalog of free slots and choose your favorite or try the fun Wheel of Fortune Hawaiian Getaway by IGT for another vacation in relaxation!\n\nFAQs \n\nWhat is the maximum potential win of the Hawaiian Fever slot? \n\nThe maximum potential win in the Hawaiian Fever slot can reach up to 1,860 times the bet.\n\nWhat type of bonuses are included in the Hawaiian Fever online slot? \n\nThe Hawaiian Fever slot is equipped with Expanding Wilds, Waikiki Respins, and a Free Spins bonus round that will help you increase potential wins.\n\nIs the Hawaiian Fever slot mobile-friendly? \n\nYes, the Hawaiian Fever slot has been created by Tom Horn Gaming with HTML5 technology, making it compatible with smartphones and tablets."

To strike gold, players must land 3 matching symbols on one of the paylines. Starting from the first reel on the left, you're looking at some pretty sweet payouts. </p><p>But wait, there's more! The Hawaiian Fever slot also welcomes all types of players with a wide range of betting options. Get in on the fun with a humble €0.20 or crank it up with a max bet possibility of €100 per spin - that's like the cost of 10 Mai Tais at a beachside bar! </p>\"\n}"

The wooden reels of the Hawaiian Fever slot are in the center of the screen and on the background there is a wonderful landscape with tropical plants, beach huts, palm trees, and the inevitable surfboards.\n\nGameplay and betting options\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the Hawaiian Fever slot has a rather straightforward approach. The layout consists of 3 rows and 3 reels, but the developers have included 27 possible ways to win, an interesting move given the reduced grid.

The Hawaiian girl is the game's wild symbol that can expand and replace normal pay symbols in winning combinations. The Aloha flower symbol is the scatter and can be used to activate the free spins feature.\n\nBonus features\n\nThe Hawaiian Fever slot is equipped with Expanding Wilds, Waikiki Respins, and a Free Spins bonus round that will help you increase potential wins. During the base game, whenever a wild symbol stops on the reels and can take part in a winning combination, it will expand. In this case, the wild symbol will cover the entire reel, accompanied by dance animations and flowers. If you manage to get 3 scatter symbols at the same time, the Free Spins bonus round will be activated and you will be awarded 10 FS while admiring a beautiful sunset in the background. During the Free Spins feature, landing the special Hawaiian girl symbol will award you a Waikiki Respin. That symbol will expand to cover the entire reel and will be locked, while the other positions will start spinning again.\n\nRTP and volatility\n\nThe RTP for the Hawaiian Fever slot is average (95.04%), while volatility is high, which means that prizes can be less frequent but considerably more valuable if they arrive. This model is combined with a maximum potential win of up to 1,860 times the bet.\n\nMaximum potential win\n\nThe maximum potential win in the Hawaiian Fever slot can reach up to 1,860 times the bet.\n\nMobile compatibility\n\nThe Hawaiian Fever slot has been created by Tom Horn Gaming with HTML5 technology, making it compatible with smartphones and tablets.\n\n        \n            ",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a review of the game \"Hawaiian Fever Slot\".\n\nPlease provide an FAQ:\n\n- 8 questions\n- Use simple language and provide practical takeaways.\n- Respond with a JSON!\n- Use the key \"faq\" and an array with the keys \"question\" and \"answer\". \n\nReview: Hawaiian Fever Slot\n\nFrom the first aloha to the buzz of the Hawaiian night, you will be enchanted by the beautiful hula girls spinning the reels of the Hawaiian Fever online slot game while expanding wild, bringing incredible wins to the lucky ones.\n\nThis is the latest version of Tom Horn Gaming, with masterfully designed graphics and entertaining gameplay. There is a potential maximum reward of up to 1,860 times the bet, so keep reading this review to learn all the details.\n\nHawaiian Fever Slot: How to Play \n\nIn terms of gameplay, the Hawaiian Fever slot has a rather straightforward approach. The layout consists of 3 rows and 3 reels, but the developers have included 27 possible ways to win, an interesting move given the reduced grid.\n\nTo form a win, 3 matching symbols must land on those paylines, starting from the first reel on the left. As for betting options, the Hawaiian Fever slot includes a wide range of options that can adapt to most types of players.\n\nThe starting option is set at €0.20, while the maximum bet possible can be €100 per spin.\n\nTheme and Design \n\nThe typical tropical Hawaiian mood is perfectly represented both in the graphics and in the soundtrack that picks up traditional music from the places. The wooden reels of the Hawaiian Fever slot are in the center of the screen and on the background there is a wonderful landscape with tropical plants, beach huts, palm trees, and the inevitable surfboards.\n\nSymbols and Payout \n\nThe symbols have a rather characteristic design and the payment table starts with the 4 low-value card suits. Moving on to the most lucrative symbols, there is a pineapple drink, a coconut drink, and finally a watermelon drink that is worth 25 times the bet for a fully covered payline. \n\nThe Hawaiian girl is the game's wild symbol that can expand and replace normal pay symbols in winning combinations. The Aloha flower symbol is the scatter and can be used to activate the free spins feature.\n\nThe RTP is average (95.04%), while volatility is high, which means that prizes can be less frequent but considerably more valuable if they arrive. This model is combined with a maximum potential win of up to 1,860 times the bet.\n\nBonus Features in Gameplay \n\nNow that we have explained the basics, it's time to take a look at the bonus features included in the Hawaiian Fever slot and how they can influence gameplay.\n\nEXPANDING WILD FEATURE \n\nDuring the base game, whenever a wild symbol stops on the reels and can take part in a winning combination, it will expand. In this case, the wild symbol will cover the entire reel, accompanied by dance animations and flowers.\n\nFREE SPIN FEATURE \n\nIf you manage to get 3 scatter symbols at the same time, the Free Spins bonus round will be activated and you will be awarded 10 FS while admiring a beautiful sunset in the background.\n\nWAIKIKI RESPIN FEATURE \n\nDuring the Free Spins feature, landing the special Hawaiian girl symbol will award you a Waikiki Respin. That symbol will expand to cover the entire reel and will be locked, while the other positions will start spinning again.\n\nGAMBLE FEATURE \n\nAfter creating a winning combination, you can choose to bet with your winnings to have a chance to increase your bankroll. You will have to correctly guess the color of a face-down card and if you make a mistake, the game will be canceled.\n\nFinal Evaluation and Verdict \n\nIf you love the sea and exotic destinations, the Hawaiian Fever slot can be a fantastic gaming experience as it combines excellent graphics and simple but entertaining gameplay. The Hawaiian scene presented with the background and symbols is fantastic, and the bonus features can be potentially profitable.\n\nHowever, there is an RTP below average and the maximum potential win can be considered relatively low for a highly volatile game like this.\n\nIf you want to try other titles from this developer, we suggest you take a look at our catalog of free slots and choose your favorite or try the fun Wheel of Fortune Hawaiian Getaway by IGT for another vacation in relaxation!\n\nFAQs \n\nWhat is the maximum potential win of the Hawaiian Fever slot? \n\nThe maximum potential win in the Hawaiian Fever slot can reach up to 1,860 times the bet.\n\nWhat type of bonuses are included in the Hawaiian Fever online slot? \n\nThe Hawaiian Fever slot is equipped with Expanding Wilds, Waikiki Respins, and a Free Spins bonus round that will help you increase potential wins.\n\nIs the Hawaiian Fever slot mobile-friendly? \n\nYes, the Hawaiian Fever slot has been created by Tom Horn Gaming with HTML5 technology, making it compatible with smartphones and tablets.\n            ",
