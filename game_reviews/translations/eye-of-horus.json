When the God of Birds Horus appears, it serves as a Wild that expands and makes the entire reel wild. The Bonus symbol can award up to 500 times your bet, and the Golden Gate serves as a Scatter.\n\nFree Games Feature\n\nThe Eye of Horus slot has a Free Games feature that is activated by landing 3, 4, or 5 Scatters on the same spin. Once activated, you'll receive a payout of 2, 20, or 50 times your bet, and you can play with 12 free spins. Pay attention to the expanding wilds during the free spins. When one of them hits, it upgrades one of the hieroglyphic symbols.\n\nTheme and Graphics\n\nThe graphics of Eye of Horus are basic, without any fancy design elements, but well executed, especially the hieroglyphic symbols.
