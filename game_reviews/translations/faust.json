Fatto ciò, cliccando sul pulsante “Gioca” dai il via ai giri!\nQuesto gioco presenta anche la funzione Autoplay, che mette in moto un numero di giri consecutivi, che andranno avanti fino a quando non sarà premuto il tasto stop.\nLe possibilità di vincita sono molteplici e si può guadagnare già a partire da un allineamento di due simboli, andando sempre da sinistra verso destra.\nIl diavolo in questa video slot fa i coperchi ma anche le pentole: permette infatti di accedere sia ai bonus sia ai free spins. All’inizio di ogni giro gratuito sarà poi selezionato un simbolo in modo casuale, che diventerà “simbolo expanding”, ossia quando comparirà (sempre nell’ambito dei free spins) non occuperà una sola posizione ma “si espanderà” fino a ricoprirne tre.\nCinque simboli di Mefistofele o di Greta che appaiono contemporaneamente moltiplicano la puntata di 2000 volte sulla linea di vincita, mentre cinque Faust portano a un moltiplicatore jackpot che ha il valore di 5000 volte!\nSlot simili\nSiete appassionati lettori e cercate delle slot VLT che si sviluppino seguendo temi letterari? Non dovete che scegliere quella che più soddisfa i vostri gusti!\nLa World Match ha sviluppato la slot Dante’s Hell, un gioco molto articolato con bonus e free spins, in cui ci si muove sulle orme di Dante tra Inferno, Paradiso e Purgatorio.\nSe preferite invece un tema letterario più leggero, Betsoft propone Pinocchio, ispirato alla celebre fiaba di Carlo Collodi che non manca di regalare un’esperienza di gioco emozionante e avventurosa.\n",

Mephistopheles is both the Wild and Scatter symbol and can replace all other symbols, and he also grants access to bonus features. The values of the symbols are minimal for playing cards and slightly higher for the alchemist's tools and the plate of food.

Clicking on the \"Play\" button initiates the game. The Autoplay function allows for consecutive spins that continue until the stop button is pressed. Wins are possible from a combination of two symbols, starting from the left to the right. In this video slot, the devil is both helpful and dangerous, providing access to bonuses and free spins. During each free spin, a random symbol is selected to be an “expanding symbol,” which fills three positions instead of only one.

This game offers a dark and immersive atmosphere that takes players on a journey through the alchemist's laboratory to discover the formula to defeat the devil himself. Faust is a 5-reel, 10-payline slot game with a minimum bet of 0.20 € and a maximum bet of 100 €.\n\nDesign and Atmosphere\n\nNovomatic has done an excellent job of creating a slot game with a truly immersive atmosphere. The alchemist's laboratory background, combined with the haunting soundtrack, creates an eerie and dark mood that engulfs players. The graphics are sharp and well-designed, and everything about the game feels polished and well-executed.\n\nSymbols and Gameplay\n\nThe symbols in Faust revolve around the alchemy lab and include Faust, his beloved Greta, tools of the lab, and food on a plate. There are also traditional playing card symbols from 9 to Ace. Mephistopheles acts as both the Wild and Scatter symbol, replacing all other symbols in a single play and unlocking the bonus features. The gameplay is straightforward, with players choosing the number of paylines to play on and then clicking the 'Play' button to start the spins. There is also an Autoplay function that can be set to run a consecutive number of spins until the stop button is pressed.\n\nBonus Features\n\nMephistopheles plays a significant role in Faust, acting as both the winner and the loser. It allows players to access both bonus and free spins. At the beginning of each free spin round, a symbol is randomly selected to become the 'expanding symbol.' This symbol will expand to cover three positions when it appears during the free spins.\n\nOther Literary-Themed Slot Games\n\nIf you're a fan of literary-themed slot games, then you're in luck. World Match has developed Dante's Hell, a complex game with bonuses and free spins, where one follows Dante through Hell, Heaven, and Purgatory. Betsoft offers Pinocchio, inspired by Carlo Collodi's famous storybook, which provides an exciting and adventurous gaming experience.\n\n        \n            ",

(4 bullet points)\n- Bullet lists briefly covering the topic \"What we don't like\". (2 bullet pints)\n- SEO optimized meta title with a maximum length of 45 characters. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay in FAUST is simple and straightforward. Players select the number of paylines they want and click the \"Play\" button to start spinning. The game also offers an Autoplay feature that can be set to a specific number of spins. Winning possibilities are varied, and players can earn from a minimum alignment of two symbols, always starting from the left to the right.\n\nDesign\n\nFAUST features a dark and immersive atmosphere that perfectly captures the alchemist's laboratory from the literary masterpiece of Goethe. The design is beautifully done, with captivating graphics and animations that capture the player's attention.\n\nSymbols\n\nFAUST features symbols that revolve around the alchemist's laboratory background, including Faust, Greta, the tools of the lab, and food on a plate. Additionally, the game includes traditional playing card symbols from 9 to Ace. Mephistopheles is the Wild and Scatter symbol, replacing all other symbols in a single play and unlocking bonus features.\n\nBonus Features\n\nMephistopheles serves as the gateway to FAUST's bonus features, including free spins. At the beginning of each free spin round, a symbol is randomly selected to become the 'expanding symbol,' meaning that when it appears (still within the free spins), it expands to cover three positions.\n\nComparable Games\n\nIf you enjoy literary-themed slot games, there are several other options available beyond FAUST. For example, World Match has developed a slot game called Dante's Hell, a game with bonuses and free spins where players move through three different realms. Alternatively, Betsoft offers Pinocchio, inspired by Carlo Collodi's famous storybook, which provides an exciting and adventurous gaming experience.\n\n        \n            ",

The game is beautifully designed with a dark and immersive atmosphere that engulfs the player, as we step into the alchemist's laboratory to discover the formula to defeat the devil himself.\n\nSymbols, Wilds and Scatter\nThe symbols that revolve around the alchemy lab background are Faust, his beloved Greta, the tools of the lab and food on a plate. Additionally, we have the traditional playing card symbols from 9 to Ace, as in any Novomatic game. Mephistopheles acts as both the Wild and Scatter symbol, replacing all other symbols in a single play, as well as unlocking the bonus features. \n\nGameplay\nOnce the game is launched and the total bet amount is selected, choose the number of paylines to play on. Then click the \"Play\" button to start the spins! The game also offers an Autoplay function that sets a consecutive number of spins to run until the stop button is pressed. Winning possibilities are varied, and you can earn from a minimum alignment of two symbols, always starting from the left to the right. \n\nThe devil, in this slot game, plays the role of both the winner and the loser. In fact, it allows players to access both bonus and free spins. Moreover, at the beginning of each free spin round, a symbol is randomly selected to become the \"expanding symbol,\" meaning that when it appears (still within the free spins), it expands to cover three positions. \n\nSimilar slots \nAre you passionate readers looking for VLT slots that develop literary themes? There is something that suits every taste! World Match has developed the slot Dante's Hell, a very elaborate game with bonuses and free spins, where one moves in the footsteps of Dante through Hell, Heaven and Purgatory. Instead, if you prefer a lighter literary theme, Betsoft offers Pinocchio, inspired by Carlo Collodi's famous storybook, which never fails to provide an exciting and adventurous gaming experience.\n        ",
