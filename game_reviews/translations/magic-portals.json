After all, that's what we seek when we play: the excitement, the pathos and the wonder in front of an unexpected event. How many of us would like a magic wand or a wizard's staff?\nNetEnt's Magic Portals explores one of the many faces of magic, perhaps the most classic one: among supernatural creatures, wizards and witches we find the slot game that we are going to review today.\nLet's start by talking about the graphic and musical aspect.\nMagic Portals - An atmospheric slot game\nUpon our first access to the game, we are greeted by a music made of percussion and relaxing music. The game grid seems to have been dropped into a starry sky and inside it we find the various symbols that will make up our plays.\nBetween the wolf and the dragon that seem to be creatures evoked by arcane circles, we also find simple spheres that take the place of the classic symbols of playing cards and that reflect the various elements of spells: fire, ice, and air.\nThere are two faces that can be seen among the various symbols: the wizard with his thick white beard and the witch with blue hair.\nA warning: the sounds related to the winnings are quite loud compared to the light background music, so we recommend keeping your computer or phone volume at medium levels.\nMagic Portals - Game mechanics\nMoving our analysis to a more technical point of view, we find ourselves in front of the classic 5*3 slot type, which shows fifteen symbols at each play and has an RTP of 96.6%. With medium volatility and twenty-five pay lines, it seems like we are facing the classic online slot, but there are still some novelties.\nThe first, which becomes evident from the first play, is represented by the two purple spheres that are found on opposite sides of the game grid: when the same symbol is positioned in both spheres, they will become a Wild symbol (a wildcard that can replace all the others) as well as all the other symbols of the same type that occupy the game grid.\nIn doing so, the slot game manages to give great value even to those symbols that usually represent only minor winnings.\nWhen two \"Free Spins\" symbols appear in the two spheres, the slot game allows the player to access the corresponding bonus mode where they will have the chance to aim for higher winnings.\nSlot games similar to Magic Portals\nAs we mentioned before and we reiterate: magic in all its forms is very well received in the world of online slots. Hence, we find titles such as Irish Magic by IGT that takes us into Irish folklore, or Rainforest Magic by Play'n Go that allows us to experience the magic of nature itself, up to the modern approach of Magic Maid Cafe! also by NetEnt.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay features\n\nMagic Portals is a 5x3 online slot game with 25 pay lines and an RTP of 96.6%. It has medium volatility and offers some unique features not found in traditional slot games. The game introduces two purple spheres that, when both land on the same symbol, turn that symbol into a Wild. This introduces high value to symbols that would usually only offer minor winnings. The game also offers a Free Spins bonus mode that is triggered when two “Free Spins” symbols are in the purple spheres at the same time.\n\nTheme\n\nMagic Portals takes the classic theme of magic, featuring supernatural creatures, wizards, and witches. The game grid appears to have been dropped into a starry sky that sets the atmospheric mood, while the symbols include a wolf, a dragon, as well as spheres representing the various elements of spells. The game offers a magical experience that is sure to appeal to many online slot players.\n\nGraphics and Soundtrack\n\nThe game's graphics are well-designed, and the music and sound effects complement the game's theme perfectly. The starry sky background provides a sense of mystery and magic, while the symbols, which range from creatures such as wolves and dragons to magical orbs, evoke a feeling of otherworldliness. The music is soothing and makes for a relaxing playing experience, but the sound effects for winning combinations are quite loud.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nMagic Portals offers an RTP of 96.6%, which is higher than the average for online slot games. The game has medium volatility, offering a balanced playing experience. The frequency of wins is decent, and the game's unique features, such as the Wild feature, make it possible for players to hit high value winnings frequently.\n\nComparison with similar games\n\nMagic Portals is one of the many online slot games that take on the theme of magic. However, it offers some unique features that set it apart from other games in the genre. For instance, the Wild feature is not commonly found in online slot games, and it makes Magic Portals stand out. Other games in the genre include Irish Magic by IGT, Rainforest Magic by Play'n Go, and Magic Maid Cafe! by NetEnt. However, Magic Portals' unique features make it a strong contender and an entertaining game for players who enjoy magic-themed online slot games.\n\n        \n            ",

It has an RTP of 96.6% and comes with several innovative features. The game has two purple spheres on opposite sides of the grid that turn into Wild symbols when the same symbol appears in both spheres.

In addition, when two 'Free Spins' symbols appear in the spheres, the player can access the bonus mode for higher winnings.\n\nVisuals and theme of Magic Portals\n\nMagic Portals features a starry sky background with symbols that include supernatural creatures, wizards, witches, and spheres that represent the various elements of spells. The game has a soothing music made up of percussion and relaxing tones. The game’s graphics and sound effects are of high quality, although the loud sounds related to winnings might require adjusting the volume levels.\n\nRTP and volatility of Magic Portals\n\nMagic Portals has an RTP of 96.6% and medium volatility. The payout percentage means that the game offers a reasonable return to the player, while the medium volatility ensures a balance between regular and larger payouts. This combination makes Magic Portals accessible to a wide range of players and an exciting game to play.\n\nWild symbols and bonus modes\n\nThe Wild symbols of Magic Portals activate when the same symbol appears in the two purple spheres on the grid, turning all other symbols of the same type into Wilds. This feature gives greater value to symbols that usually offer lower payouts. The game also has a Free Spins mode that gets activated by two 'Free Spins' symbols appearing in the spheres. During this mode, players can aim for higher winnings and increase their chances of hitting the jackpot.\n\nComparison to other magic-themed online slot games\n\nMagic Portals is a classic magic-themed slot game that explores wizards and witches and their powers. While there are many slot games that explore various forms of magic, Magic Portals stands out with its innovative features and engaging gameplay. Other magic-themed slot games worth playing include Irish Magic by IGT, Rainforest Magic by Play'n Go, and Magic Maid Cafe! also by NetEnt.\n\n        \n            ",

The game grid seems to have been dropped into a starry sky and inside it we find the various symbols that will make up our plays.\nBetween the wolf and the dragon that seem to be creatures evoked by arcane circles, we also find simple spheres that take the place of the classic symbols of playing cards and that reflect the various elements of spells: fire, ice, and air.\nThere are two faces that can be seen among the various symbols: the wizard with his thick white beard and the witch with blue hair.\nA warning: the sounds related to the winnings are quite loud compared to the light background music, so we recommend keeping your computer or phone volume at medium levels.\nMagic Portals - Game mechanics\nMoving our analysis to a more technical point of view, we find ourselves in front of the classic 5*3 slot type, which shows fifteen symbols at each play and has an RTP of 96.6%. With medium volatility and twenty-five pay lines, it seems like we are facing the classic online slot, but there are still some novelties.\nThe first, which becomes evident from the first play, is represented by the two purple spheres that are found on opposite sides of the game grid: when the same symbol is positioned in both spheres, they will become a Wild symbol (a wildcard that can replace all the others) as well as all the other symbols of the same type that occupy the game grid.\nIn doing so, the slot game manages to give great value even to those symbols that usually represent only minor winnings.\nWhen two \"Free Spins\" symbols appear in the two spheres, the slot game allows the player to access the corresponding bonus mode where they will have the chance to aim for higher winnings.\nSlot games similar to Magic Portals\nAs we mentioned before and we reiterate: magic in all its forms is very well received in the world of online slots. Hence, we find titles such as Irish Magic by IGT that takes us into Irish folklore, or Rainforest Magic by Play'n Go that allows us to experience the magic of nature itself, up to the modern approach of Magic Maid Cafe! also by NetEnt.\n        ",
