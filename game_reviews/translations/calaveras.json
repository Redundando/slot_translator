Da un punto di vista prettamente matematico, la slot è dotata di un RTP pari a 94,85%, non il più alto del settore e neanche tra le slot della stessa Capecod, ma che comunque ha un ottimo valore considerato che il minimo per legge è 90 e il massimo è in genere sotto il 100.\nSlot simili a Calaveras\nÈ lecito cercare delle slot simili a quelle che ci hanno colpito maggiormente. Se stiamo parlando di meccaniche di gioco, molti altri titoli della stessa Capecod rispondono alle nostre esigenze, in quanto spesso offrono la meccanica 5*3 e modalità bonus simili.

It's only when we start the game and the reels start spinning again that the music becomes the true protagonist.\nThe symbols, both those that depict the various characters and those dedicated to playing cards (A, K, Q...) are all very colorful and convey the idea of celebration that this day has.\nCalaveras: Game Mechanics\nMoving on to the more technical aspect, unlike many titles from Capecod, in the case of Calaveras we find a good number of paylines, an aspect that (combined with the 5*3 game grid) allows anyone with a minimal amount of experience to immediately get the hang of it.\nSpeaking of symbols, the white skulls are our key to accessing free spins, where all the symbols become skulls of various colors and which easily allows for a large number of combinations.\nDuring this mode, the white skull becomes a Wild symbol, acting as a joker for various combinations.\nIn the normal game, on the other hand, the Wild symbol is played by food and liquor (other great protagonists of Mexican tradition).

If we are talking about game mechanics, many other Capecod titles meet our needs, as they often offer the 5*3 mechanics and similar bonus modes. In this case, we could recommend Ulisse, Time Machine Creator, or Chicken Hatch.\nIf it is the theme that has piqued our curiosity, we could try Dia de Los Muertos by AWP, which shows other features of this famous holiday.\n            ",

The Capecod development house takes us to visit Mexico during the famous Day of the Dead (or, in the original language, Dias de Los Muertos). The very name of the slot is inspired by the sugar skulls typical of this holiday, so we can expect a slot with a good taste and musical accompaniment of mariachi.\nIn this quick review, we will take a look at the various aspects of this title in order to get a rough idea before diving into the actual game.\nCalaveras: Visual Appearance\nThe graphics and sound take on an even more important role when it comes to a theme like this. In the case of Calaveras, both the symbols that make up the game grid and the music that accompanies our plays are all in line with the theme.\nLet's start with the background: the houses that frame our game screen resemble the streets of Mexican cities, very similar in some ways to those in Italy (one of the many similarities between Latin countries) and the music is no exception.\nIn the intervals between one spin of the reels and another, we can hear the sound of trumpets and guitars almost muffled, ideal for creating atmosphere. It's only when we start the game and the reels start spinning again that the music becomes the true protagonist.\nThe symbols, both those that depict the various characters and those dedicated to playing cards (A, K, Q...) are all very colorful and convey the idea of celebration that this day has.\nCalaveras: Game Mechanics\nMoving on to the more technical aspect, unlike many titles from Capecod, in the case of Calaveras we find a good number of paylines, an aspect that (combined with the 5*3 game grid) allows anyone with a minimal amount of experience to immediately get the hang of it.\nSpeaking of symbols, the white skulls are our key to accessing free spins, where all the symbols become skulls of various colors and which easily allows for a large number of combinations.\nDuring this mode, the white skull becomes a Wild symbol, acting as a joker for various combinations.\nIn the normal game, on the other hand, the Wild symbol is played by food and liquor (other great protagonists of Mexican tradition). From a purely mathematical point of view, the slot machine has an RTP of 94.85%, not the highest in the sector and not even among Capecod's own slots, but which still has an excellent value considering that the minimum by law is 90 and the maximum is generally below 100.\nSlots like Calaveras\nIt is possible to search for slots that are similar to the ones we have been most impressed by. If we are talking about game mechanics, many other Capecod titles meet our needs, as they often offer the 5*3 mechanics and similar bonus modes. In this case, we could recommend Ulisse, Time Machine Creator, or Chicken Hatch.\nIf it is the theme that has piqued our curiosity, we could try Dia de Los Muertos by AWP, which shows other features of this famous holiday.\n            ",

The Capecod development house takes us to visit Mexico during the famous Day of the Dead (or, in the original language, Dias de Los Muertos). The very name of the slot is inspired by the sugar skulls typical of this holiday, so we can expect a slot with a good taste and musical accompaniment of mariachi.\nIn this quick review, we will take a look at the various aspects of this title in order to get a rough idea before diving into the actual game.\nCalaveras: Visual Appearance\nThe graphics and sound take on an even more important role when it comes to a theme like this. In the case of Calaveras, both the symbols that make up the game grid and the music that accompanies our plays are all in line with the theme.\nLet's start with the background: the houses that frame our game screen resemble the streets of Mexican cities, very similar in some ways to those in Italy (one of the many similarities between Latin countries) and the music is no exception.\nIn the intervals between one spin of the reels and another, we can hear the sound of trumpets and guitars almost muffled, ideal for creating atmosphere. It's only when we start the game and the reels start spinning again that the music becomes the true protagonist.\nThe symbols, both those that depict the various characters and those dedicated to playing cards (A, K, Q...) are all very colorful and convey the idea of celebration that this day has.\nCalaveras: Game Mechanics\nMoving on to the more technical aspect, unlike many titles from Capecod, in the case of Calaveras we find a good number of paylines, an aspect that (combined with the 5*3 game grid) allows anyone with a minimal amount of experience to immediately get the hang of it.\nSpeaking of symbols, the white skulls are our key to accessing free spins, where all the symbols become skulls of various colors and which easily allows for a large number of combinations.\nDuring this mode, the white skull becomes a Wild symbol, acting as a joker for various combinations.\nIn the normal game, on the other hand, the Wild symbol is played by food and liquor (other great protagonists of Mexican tradition). From a purely mathematical point of view, the slot machine has an RTP of 94.85%, not the highest in the sector and not even among Capecod's own slots, but which still has an excellent value considering that the minimum by law is 90 and the maximum is generally below 100.\nSlots like Calaveras\nIt is possible to search for slots that are similar to the ones we have been most impressed by. If we are talking about game mechanics, many other Capecod titles meet our needs, as they often offer the 5*3 mechanics and similar bonus modes. In this case, we could recommend Ulisse, Time Machine Creator, or Chicken Hatch.\nIf it is the theme that has piqued our curiosity, we could try Dia de Los Muertos by AWP, which shows other features of this famous holiday.\n            ",
