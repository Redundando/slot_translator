The Autoplay button allows for automatic spins, with a range of 50 to 1,000 spins available. There is also a speedy spin option. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.24%.\n\nThere are two types of symbols in Chang Thai: low-value ones and high-paying ones. The game’s Wild is the blue stone, which appears in the base game and replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter only appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. Three other Wild symbols are associated with the bonus game, triggered by the Scatter, which requires landing 3 Scatters on adjacent reels. Players can choose from three Wild symbols in the bonus round, which reward 4, 7, or 10 free spins and a specific number of guaranteed Wilds depending on the selected symbol.\n\nOverall, Chang Thai is a highly engaging slot game that offers players the potential for significant wins through its bonus round and immersive gameplay.\n        ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics and features\n\nChang Thai has a 5x4 play grid with 50 variable paylines. Each payline has a minimum cost of 0.20 coins and there are five levels of bets to choose from. The Max Bet button lets you place the highest bet with just one click, while the Autoplay button allows you to start automatic spins, from a minimum of 50 to a maximum of 1,000. Another appreciated feature is the one that activates speedy spins. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.24%.\n\nSymbols and their values\n\nChang Thai offers two types of symbols: low-value ones, such as the playing cards from 9 to Ace, and high-paying ones, such as the monkey, crocodile, bear, tiger, and elephant. During the base game, the blue stone serves as our Wild and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, which only appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nBonus game mechanics\n\nThree other Wild symbols are instead associated with the bonus game, triggered by the Scatter, represented by a golden flower with a red gem in the center. To be eligible for the special function, you need to land 3 Scatters on adjacent reels. Before the free spins start, you will be asked to choose one of the available Wilds. Depending on your choice, you will receive a combination of Free Spins and guaranteed Wilds. The red Wild rewards us with 4 free spins and guarantees the landing of 188 Wilds. The yellow Wild rewards us with 7 free spins and 128 Wilds. The green Wild rewards us with 10 free spins and 88 Wilds.\n\nReturn to player (RTP)\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.24%.\n\nAtmosphere and graphics\n\nChang Thai takes us on a wild journey to the depths of southern Thailand, where dangerous wild animals and lush vegetation populate a virgin forest. The play grid is nestled among the leaves, with an animated elephant on the left and a Thai temple in the background. The symbols are well-defined, though not as impressive as other products from the same software house.

You can also enable speedy spins. The slot has five levels of bets to choose from, and the Max Bet button lets you place the highest bet with one click.\n\nPaylines and Minimum Cost\n\nChang Thai has a 5x4 play grid with 50 variable paylines. Each payline has a minimum cost of 0.20 coins.\n\nSymbols\n\nLow-value symbols include playing cards from 9 to Ace, while high-paying ones include the monkey, crocodile, bear, tiger, and elephant. During the base game, the blue stone serves as the Wild and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, which appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. The bonus game is triggered by a Scatter symbol, represented by a golden flower with a red gem at the center. There are three other Wild symbols associated with the bonus game.

The red Wild rewards us with 4 free spins and guarantees the landing of 188 Wilds. The yellow Wild rewards us with 7 free spins and 128 Wilds. The green Wild rewards us with 10 free spins and 88 Wilds.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP)\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) for Chang Thai is 95.24%.\n\n        \n            ",

But let's not forget to give credit where credit is due: the graphics of this game are truly impressive. The play grid is nestled among the leaves, with an animated elephant on the left and a Thai temple in the background. The number of active lines is indicated on either side, while the buttons to change your bet can be found at the bottom, along with windows that update your balance and wins after each spin. The symbols are well-defined, though not as impressive as other products from the same software house. The oriental-sounding music adds to the immersive atmosphere during gameplay. \n\nAs for the specs of this slot, Chang Thai has a 5x4 play grid with 50 variable paylines. Each payline has a minimum cost of 0.20 coins and there are five levels of bets to choose from. The Max Bet button lets you place the highest bet with just one click, while the Autoplay button allows you to start automatic spins, from a minimum of 50 to a maximum of 1,000. Another appreciated feature is the one that activates speedy spins. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.24%.\n\nWhen it comes to symbols and functionalities, Chang Thai offers two types of symbols: low-value ones, such as the playing cards from 9 to Ace, and high-paying ones, such as the monkey, crocodile, bear, tiger, and elephant. During the base game, the blue stone serves as our Wild and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, which only appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. Three other Wild symbols are instead associated with the bonus game, triggered by the Scatter, represented by a golden flower with a red gem in the center. To be eligible for the special function, you need to land 3 Scatters on adjacent reels. Before the free spins start, you will be asked to choose one of the available Wilds. Depending on your choice, you will receive a combination of Free Spins and guaranteed Wilds. Let's take a closer look at them:\n\nThe red Wild rewards us with 4 free spins and guarantees the landing of 188 Wilds.\nThe yellow Wild rewards us with 7 free spins and 128 Wilds.\nThe green Wild rewards us with 10 free spins and 88 Wilds.\n\nAll in all, Chang Thai is a game that will satisfy even the most experienced of gamblers, with its immersive graphics, engaging gameplay, and features that can lead to huge wins.\n        ",
