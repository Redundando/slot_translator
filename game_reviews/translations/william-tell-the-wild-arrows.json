In case you have been living under a rock, he was forced by Gessler, the king's administrator, to shoot an arrow with his crossbow, attempting to hit an apple placed above the head of his young son. ISoftBet has created a beautiful slot game with stunning graphics, set in a Swiss valley crossed by a river, with blue and green dominating the scene. The grid is located in a wooden structure, and the buttons are positioned on the right-hand side. The top space is intended for the three available jackpots. The symbols are precisely drawn, and the background music adds to the epic tone of the game.\n\nSlot Features\nISoftBet has focused on a classic grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows on which 25 fixed paylines are unravelled. Bets start from a minimum of €0.25, and you can bet up to €25 per round. To speed up the game, you can use the Autoplay feature, which allows you to set a defined number of automatic spins, or the Turbo function, which accelerates the rotation of the reels. You win by matching identical symbols on an active payline.\nThe theoretical return to the player is 96%, and the volatility is low.\n\nBonuses and Three Rich Jackpots\nIn William Tell & the Wild Arrow, we find two groups of symbols, base and high. The first are represented by playing cards good for a royal flush and do not pay high amounts, unlike thematic symbols that have a much higher value. To have a clear idea of the rewards, we recommend accessing the internal menu and going to the Payment section.\nAmong the special symbols, we find the Wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented by a target. Five or more of these symbols are needed to start three free Respins during which multipliers between 1x and 100x land on the reels. At any time, an arrow can hit the grid and divide a sector into other mini-squares, with the possibility of creating more combos. During Respins, you can win one of the three jackpots, which multiply the bet by 20x, 50x, or 100x.\nThere are also five modifiers that can appear during the base game. One fills the grid with a single symbol, giving rise to numerous combinations; another transforms some symbols into Wilds, while another removes low-level symbols.\n\nFAQs\nAre the Jackpots progressive?\n\nNo, in William Tell & the Wild Arrow, we have three fixed jackpots that multiply the bet by 20x, 50x, or 100x.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to the player?\n\nAt this stage, the RTP value corresponds to 96%.\n\nHow do I obtain the modifiers?\n\nThe modifiers are random, but for those who want to, you can purchase them by clicking the mask button on the left-hand side of the grid.",

For those few who do not know, Guglielmo was forced by Gessler, administrator of the king, to shoot an arrow with his crossbow trying to hit an apple placed on the head of his young son. ISoftBet has created a beautiful slot game in terms of graphics, set in a Swiss valley crossed by a river, with blue and green dominating the scene. The grid is located in a wooden structure and the buttons are positioned on the right. The top space is instead reserved for the three Jackpots available. The symbols are drawn with precision and the background music increases even more the epic tone of the game.\n\nSlot Features\nISoftBet has bet on a classic grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows on which the 25 fixed paylines unfold. Bets start from a minimum of €0.25 and go up to a maximum of €25 per game. To speed up the game you can use the Autoplay function, which allows you to set a defined number of automatic spins, or the Turbo function, which accelerates the rotation of the reels. You win by matching identical symbols on an active payline. The theoretical return to player is 96%, the volatility is low.\n\nBonus and three rich Jackpots\nIn William Tell & the Wild Arrow we find two groups of symbols, the basic ones and the High ones. The first are represented by playing cards good for a royal flush and do not pay high amounts, unlike the thematic symbols that have much higher value. To get a clear idea of the rewards, we recommend accessing the internal menu and going to the Payment section. Among the special symbols we find the Wild that replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by a target. Five or more of these symbols are needed to trigger 3 free Respins during which we will see multipliers ranging from 1x to 100x landing on the reels. At any time an arrow can hit the grid and divide a sector into other mini-squares, with the possibility of creating even more combos.

The first are represented by playing cards good for a royal flush and do not pay high amounts, unlike the thematic symbols that have much higher value. To get a clear idea of the rewards, we recommend accessing the internal menu and going to the Payment section. Among the special symbols we find the Wild that replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by a target. Five or more of these symbols are needed to trigger 3 free Respins during which we will see multipliers ranging from 1x to 100x landing on the reels. At any time an arrow can hit the grid and divide a sector into other mini-squares, with the possibility of creating even more combos. During the Respins it is possible to win one of the three Jackpots, which multiply the bet by 20, 50 or 100. There are also five modifiers that can appear during the base game. One fills the grid with a single symbol, creating numerous combinations, another transforms some symbols into Wilds, while another removes low-level symbols.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAre the Jackpots progressive?\n\nNo, in William Tell & the Wild Arrow we have 3 fixed Jackpots that multiply the bet by 20, 50 or 100.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nAt this stage, the RTP value corresponds to 96%.\n\nHow do I get the modifiers?\n\nThe modifiers are random, but for those who want to, they can be purchased by clicking the mask button to the left of the grid.\n            ",

During the Respins, players can win one of the three fixed Jackpots, multiplying their bet by 20, 50, or 100. The game also has five random modifiers that can appear during the base game.

For those few who do not know, Guglielmo was forced by Gessler, administrator of the king, to shoot an arrow with his crossbow trying to hit an apple placed on the head of his young son. ISoftBet has created a beautiful slot game in terms of graphics, set in a Swiss valley crossed by a river, with blue and green dominating the scene. The grid is located in a wooden structure and the buttons are positioned on the right. The top space is instead reserved for the three Jackpots available. The symbols are drawn with precision and the background music increases even more the epic tone of the game.\n\nSlot Features\nISoftBet has bet on a classic grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows on which the 25 fixed paylines unfold. Bets start from a minimum of €0.25 and go up to a maximum of €25 per game. To speed up the game you can use the Autoplay function, which allows you to set a defined number of automatic spins, or the Turbo function, which accelerates the rotation of the reels. You win by matching identical symbols on an active payline. The theoretical return to player is 96%, the volatility is low.\n\nBonus and three rich Jackpots\nIn William Tell & the Wild Arrow we find two groups of symbols, the basic ones and the High ones. The first are represented by playing cards good for a royal flush and do not pay high amounts, unlike the thematic symbols that have much higher value. To get a clear idea of the rewards, we recommend accessing the internal menu and going to the Payment section. Among the special symbols we find the Wild that replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by a target. Five or more of these symbols are needed to trigger 3 free Respins during which we will see multipliers ranging from 1x to 100x landing on the reels. At any time an arrow can hit the grid and divide a sector into other mini-squares, with the possibility of creating even more combos. During the Respins it is possible to win one of the three Jackpots, which multiply the bet by 20, 50 or 100. There are also five modifiers that can appear during the base game. One fills the grid with a single symbol, creating numerous combinations, another transforms some symbols into Wilds, while another removes low-level symbols.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAre the Jackpots progressive?\n\nNo, in William Tell & the Wild Arrow we have 3 fixed Jackpots that multiply the bet by 20, 50 or 100.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nAt this stage, the RTP value corresponds to 96%.\n\nHow do I get the modifiers?\n\nThe modifiers are random, but for those who want to, they can be purchased by clicking the mask button to the left of the grid.\n            ",

For those few who do not know, Guglielmo was forced by Gessler, administrator of the king, to shoot an arrow with his crossbow trying to hit an apple placed on the head of his young son. ISoftBet has created a beautiful slot game in terms of graphics, set in a Swiss valley crossed by a river, with blue and green dominating the scene. The grid is located in a wooden structure and the buttons are positioned on the right. The top space is instead reserved for the three Jackpots available. The symbols are drawn with precision and the background music increases even more the epic tone of the game.\n\nSlot Features\nISoftBet has bet on a classic grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows on which the 25 fixed paylines unfold. Bets start from a minimum of €0.25 and go up to a maximum of €25 per game. To speed up the game you can use the Autoplay function, which allows you to set a defined number of automatic spins, or the Turbo function, which accelerates the rotation of the reels. You win by matching identical symbols on an active payline. The theoretical return to player is 96%, the volatility is low.\n\nBonus and three rich Jackpots\nIn William Tell & the Wild Arrow we find two groups of symbols, the basic ones and the High ones. The first are represented by playing cards good for a royal flush and do not pay high amounts, unlike the thematic symbols that have much higher value. To get a clear idea of the rewards, we recommend accessing the internal menu and going to the Payment section. Among the special symbols we find the Wild that replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by a target. Five or more of these symbols are needed to trigger 3 free Respins during which we will see multipliers ranging from 1x to 100x landing on the reels. At any time an arrow can hit the grid and divide a sector into other mini-squares, with the possibility of creating even more combos. During the Respins it is possible to win one of the three Jackpots, which multiply the bet by 20, 50 or 100. There are also five modifiers that can appear during the base game. One fills the grid with a single symbol, creating numerous combinations, another transforms some symbols into Wilds, while another removes low-level symbols.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAre the Jackpots progressive?\n\nNo, in William Tell & the Wild Arrow we have 3 fixed Jackpots that multiply the bet by 20, 50 or 100.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nAt this stage, the RTP value corresponds to 96%.\n\nHow do I get the modifiers?\n\nThe modifiers are random, but for those who want to, they can be purchased by clicking the mask button to the left of the grid.\n            ",
