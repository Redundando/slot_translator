But first, let's focus on the regular symbols and their value. As in the vast majority of slot games, you'll find the playing card symbols from nine to ace, which are less profitable. To start getting higher payouts, you need to score some combinations with the fruit bowl, harp, cornucopia, and of course, Dionysus himself.\nNow let's take a look at the special symbols, starting with the Wild symbol, represented by the golden vase. In addition to serving as a wild symbol and replacing all symbols except for the Scatter, every time it appears at least three times, it pays us back as much as the highest-paying symbol, which is Dionysus himself. Another function of the Wild is to always give a multiplier, varying in value depending on the number. For example, a 2x multiplier with one Wild, 4x with two, and so on up to a multiplier of x32 if you land five of them on the grid.\nThe golden mask is our Scatter. When it appears, it first transforms into a paying symbol, then transforms all adjacent symbols into that same symbol.

In addition to serving as a wild symbol and replacing all symbols except for the Scatter, every time it appears at least three times, it pays us back as much as the highest-paying symbol, which is Dionysus himself. Another function of the Wild is to always give a multiplier, varying in value depending on the number. For example, a 2x multiplier with one Wild, 4x with two, and so on up to a multiplier of x32 if you land five of them on the grid.\nThe golden mask is our Scatter. When it appears, it first transforms into a paying symbol, then transforms all adjacent symbols into that same symbol. Moreover, it triggers a Respin during which the altered symbols remain sticky on the reels.\nThe silver mask is another Scatter that, together with the golden mask, activates the Free Spins feature that brings a high number of masks and Wild multipliers to the grid. You can purchase this feature by paying 85 times your bet.\n\nFAQs\nWhat is the betting range for Dionysus Golden Feast?\n\nYou can bet from €0.10 up to a maximum of €100.\n\nWhat is the maximum payout for this slot?\n\nYou can win up to 7,500 times your bet.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player rate for Dionysus Golden Feast?\n\nThe RTP value is 96.16%.\n            ",

The Wilds pay as much as Dionysus himself - and who wouldn't want to be paid like a Greek god, am I right? Plus, every time a Wild appears at least three times, it awards a multiplier that varies depending on how many Wilds show up. It's simple math, really: the more Wilds, the bigger the multiplier.</p><p>And don't forget about the Scatter symbol! It's like the class clown of the slot world, always goofing around and causing mischief. When it shows up, it can transform into an adjacent symbol, trigger a Respin, and even activate the Free Spins feature! Talk about multitasking.</p>\"\n}"

Thunderkick pays homage to his greatness with a stunning slot game set in his divine abode, a beautiful terrace adorned with columns from which grape clusters hang. Purple dominates the color scheme, a nod to the wine we'll be toasting to before we start playing with the Free Spins.\nOverall, the graphics of Dionysus Golden Feast are carefully crafted, with symbols that are well-designed and full of detail, and buttons arranged efficiently on the screen to make gameplay easy.\nThe sound quality is worth mentioning with relaxing music that soothes during the spins.\nFeatures of the slot\nNow let's talk about the uncomplicated gameplay of this slot that captures your attention from the first spin. The game grid has 5 reels and 3 rows where 15 fixed paylines are in place.\nThe minimum bet per spin is €0.10 with a potential win of up to 7,500x the bet. To get a winning combination, you must land at least three adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and progressing towards the right.\nYou can set a variable number of automatic spins with Autoplay which can be stopped at any time.\nThe volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player rate stands at a decent 96.16%.\nRegular and special symbols\nUndoubtedly, the most delicious dish of this game is the bonus system that can give you very interesting winnings. But first, let's focus on the regular symbols and their value. As in the vast majority of slot games, you'll find the playing card symbols from nine to ace, which are less profitable. To start getting higher payouts, you need to score some combinations with the fruit bowl, harp, cornucopia, and of course, Dionysus himself.\nNow let's take a look at the special symbols, starting with the Wild symbol, represented by the golden vase. In addition to serving as a wild symbol and replacing all symbols except for the Scatter, every time it appears at least three times, it pays us back as much as the highest-paying symbol, which is Dionysus himself. Another function of the Wild is to always give a multiplier, varying in value depending on the number. For example, a 2x multiplier with one Wild, 4x with two, and so on up to a multiplier of x32 if you land five of them on the grid.\nThe golden mask is our Scatter. When it appears, it first transforms into a paying symbol, then transforms all adjacent symbols into that same symbol. Moreover, it triggers a Respin during which the altered symbols remain sticky on the reels.\nThe silver mask is another Scatter that, together with the golden mask, activates the Free Spins feature that brings a high number of masks and Wild multipliers to the grid. You can purchase this feature by paying 85 times your bet.\n\nFAQs\nWhat is the betting range for Dionysus Golden Feast?\n\nYou can bet from €0.10 up to a maximum of €100.\n\nWhat is the maximum payout for this slot?\n\nYou can win up to 7,500 times your bet.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player rate for Dionysus Golden Feast?\n\nThe RTP value is 96.16%.\n            ",

Thunderkick pays homage to his greatness with a stunning slot game set in his divine abode, a beautiful terrace adorned with columns from which grape clusters hang. Purple dominates the color scheme, a nod to the wine we'll be toasting to before we start playing with the Free Spins.\nOverall, the graphics of Dionysus Golden Feast are carefully crafted, with symbols that are well-designed and full of detail, and buttons arranged efficiently on the screen to make gameplay easy.\nThe sound quality is worth mentioning with relaxing music that soothes during the spins.\nFeatures of the slot\nNow let's talk about the uncomplicated gameplay of this slot that captures your attention from the first spin. The game grid has 5 reels and 3 rows where 15 fixed paylines are in place.\nThe minimum bet per spin is €0.10 with a potential win of up to 7,500x the bet. To get a winning combination, you must land at least three adjacent symbols starting from the leftmost reel and progressing towards the right.\nYou can set a variable number of automatic spins with Autoplay which can be stopped at any time.\nThe volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player rate stands at a decent 96.16%.\nRegular and special symbols\nUndoubtedly, the most delicious dish of this game is the bonus system that can give you very interesting winnings. But first, let's focus on the regular symbols and their value. As in the vast majority of slot games, you'll find the playing card symbols from nine to ace, which are less profitable. To start getting higher payouts, you need to score some combinations with the fruit bowl, harp, cornucopia, and of course, Dionysus himself.\nNow let's take a look at the special symbols, starting with the Wild symbol, represented by the golden vase. In addition to serving as a wild symbol and replacing all symbols except for the Scatter, every time it appears at least three times, it pays us back as much as the highest-paying symbol, which is Dionysus himself. Another function of the Wild is to always give a multiplier, varying in value depending on the number. For example, a 2x multiplier with one Wild, 4x with two, and so on up to a multiplier of x32 if you land five of them on the grid.\nThe golden mask is our Scatter. When it appears, it first transforms into a paying symbol, then transforms all adjacent symbols into that same symbol. Moreover, it triggers a Respin during which the altered symbols remain sticky on the reels.\nThe silver mask is another Scatter that, together with the golden mask, activates the Free Spins feature that brings a high number of masks and Wild multipliers to the grid. You can purchase this feature by paying 85 times your bet.\n\nFAQs\nWhat is the betting range for Dionysus Golden Feast?\n\nYou can bet from €0.10 up to a maximum of €100.\n\nWhat is the maximum payout for this slot?\n\nYou can win up to 7,500 times your bet.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player rate for Dionysus Golden Feast?\n\nThe RTP value is 96.16%.\n            ",
