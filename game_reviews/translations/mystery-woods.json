Enter this magical world through 1×2 Gaming's Mystery Woods slot and win up to 12,500 times your bet. It is an excellently crafted slot in terms of aesthetics, with 4 special symbols, including Wilds and Scatters. But it's especially its bonus round with increasing multiplier that will amuse players, who will be perplexed by its fixed RTP set at 94%. Yes, a value below the average of the online industry, which settles at 96%.\nLet's try to overcome this detail and move on: the renowned provider 1×2 Gaming has decided to start from a standard 5×3 grid with 20 paylines where, with a little patience in the game, magic can come to life.

The reels are very lively and colorful, with a beautiful animation that accompanies the entire gaming session.

The first thing we notice is that during the base game, a Mystery symbol may appear that replaces the icons on the reels. But it is especially the tree that has a central role: it can continue to spin when the reels are still to reveal a multiplier.\nIf you instead find 3 Scatters on reels 1, 3 and 5 of the base game, the additional adventure with 10 Free Spins and a multiplier that increases by one every time you get a goal shown in the Golden Tree symbol function will begin.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\nDoes the Mystery Woods online slot have winning potential?\n\nThe maximum winning potential is equal to 12,500 times the bet with the Mystery Woods slot.\n\nCan I try it for free from my smartphone?\n\nYes, the Mystery Woods slot is optimized for mobile devices and you can try it from your browser on both your phone and tablet.\n\nIs 1x2 Gaming a safe and reliable provider?\n\nPerhaps not everyone knows it, but it's an excellent brand that was founded in 2003 in the United Kingdom and since then has created countless titles for online gaming.\n            ",

Enter this magical world through 1×2 Gaming's Mystery Woods slot and win up to 12,500 times your bet. It is an excellently crafted slot in terms of aesthetics, with 4 special symbols, including Wilds and Scatters. But it's especially its bonus round with increasing multiplier that will amuse players, who will be perplexed by its fixed RTP set at 94%. Yes, a value below the average of the online industry, which settles at 96%.\nLet's try to overcome this detail and move on: the renowned provider 1×2 Gaming has decided to start from a standard 5×3 grid with 20 paylines where, with a little patience in the game, magic can come to life. Let's see how!\nGraphics and features of the slot\nNever go into the woods at night, because it can really be dangerous. That's what we think seeing the graphics of this slot that manages to perfectly recreate the surrounding environment as we imagine it. The reels are very lively and colorful, with a beautiful animation that accompanies the entire gaming session. Among the chosen symbols we have the less lucrative ones that are represented by real playing cards, then moving on to the leaf, the flower, the snake ready for action, the mushroom and the tree, capable of paying from 4 to 25 times the bet.\nThere are also 4 special symbols, although the one that catches our attention is obviously the Wild, capable of substituting all normal pay symbols to achieve winning combinations.\nBonus game and functionalities\nLet's not deny it: the game and gameplay are nice, but the best part of this online slot is its bonus game. The first thing we notice is that during the base game, a Mystery symbol may appear that replaces the icons on the reels. But it is especially the tree that has a central role: it can continue to spin when the reels are still to reveal a multiplier.\nIf you instead find 3 Scatters on reels 1, 3 and 5 of the base game, the additional adventure with 10 Free Spins and a multiplier that increases by one every time you get a goal shown in the Golden Tree symbol function will begin.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\nDoes the Mystery Woods online slot have winning potential?\n\nThe maximum winning potential is equal to 12,500 times the bet with the Mystery Woods slot.\n\nCan I try it for free from my smartphone?\n\nYes, the Mystery Woods slot is optimized for mobile devices and you can try it from your browser on both your phone and tablet.\n\nIs 1x2 Gaming a safe and reliable provider?\n\nPerhaps not everyone knows it, but it's an excellent brand that was founded in 2003 in the United Kingdom and since then has created countless titles for online gaming.\n            ",
