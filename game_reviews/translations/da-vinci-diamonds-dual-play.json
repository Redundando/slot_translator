This slot offers the possibility of using the Tumbling Reels mode, already present in the original version, twice in the same gaming session. With this function, the icons fall from the top of the game panel and, in case of winning symbol combinations, disappear, leaving room for new symbols to multiply the chances of winning. The slot machine keeps the 5 reels of the basic version but doubles the game panels in a single screen. Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play can thus be defined as a double slot machine with double chances of winning.\n\nGraphics of the slot machine\n\nThe background depicting the Mona Lisa portrait that characterizes the classic version of Da Vinci Diamonds disappears in this new version, leaving room for a homogeneous base in red, highlighted by a luxurious golden frame. Inside the frame, on a green background, the reels appear. There are two game panels, and underneath them, there are the buttons to change the bet value, the display showing the accumulated winnings, and the balance control, the \"Spin\" button to start the reels, and the settings command. With 5 reels, a total of 6 lines, and 40 paylines, this slot dedicated to the great genius still hits the mark. The symbols are the same as in the first version, and in addition to precious stones such as amber, ruby, and emerald, the three famous paintings appear once again: the Mona Lisa, the Musician portrait, and Lady with an Ermine. The solemn background music also accompanies the relaxing wagers on the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine, produced by IGT.\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the slot\n\nIn the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play online slot machine, the symbols that pay less in the winning combinations are the precious gems. The three works of art with the Mona Lisa at the top increase the winnings, being able to pay up to 1000 times the bet. Here, as in the base version of the game, the luckiest symbol in winning combinations is the diamond icon with the writing Da Vinci Diamonds, which can pay up to 5000 times the bet by appearing 5 times on the reels.\n\nThe Wild symbol of the slot, namely the icon showing the homonymous writing, replaces all the other symbols like a joker, except for the Extra Paylines icon, in order to create the best winning combinations. Aligning three Bonus symbols on the same winning line instead grants access to the Extra Paylines Bonus, which rewards the lucky players with the automatic activation of 6 free spins. In addition, within this game mode, another 20 paylines become active for a total of 60 lines, and when other Extra Paylines symbols appear on reels number 1, 2, and 3, the free spins will be reactivated up to a maximum of 300 times. Thanks to these fantastic special features, the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine is all one needs to relive the glorious times of the Renaissance.\n\nSlots similar to Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play\n\nIf you have already played Da Vinci Diamonds, the previous version of this slot, and want to continue exploring the world of the many geniuses who, like Leonardo, have created truly remarkable wonders, try the Genius slot machine, produced by Capecod. The slot, fun and entertaining, has the great genius Einstein as its main character, who moves inside a laboratory among retorts, formulas, and plasma lamps.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs it possible to try it on a smartphone without an app?\n\nYes, there is absolutely no need to download an app. You can try it directly from your browser without registering.\n\nHow much does the online slot machine pay?\n\nThis title can pay up to 5,000 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine?\n\nThe return to player is 94.3%, well below the average of online slots.",

The solemn background music also accompanies the relaxing wagers on the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine, produced by IGT.\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the slot\n\nIn the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play online slot machine, the symbols that pay less in the winning combinations are the precious gems. The three works of art with the Mona Lisa at the top increase the winnings, being able to pay up to 1000 times the bet. Here, as in the base version of the game, the luckiest symbol in winning combinations is the diamond icon with the writing Da Vinci Diamonds, which can pay up to 5000 times the bet by appearing 5 times on the reels.\n\nThe Wild symbol of the slot, namely the icon showing the homonymous writing, replaces all the other symbols like a joker, except for the Extra Paylines icon, in order to create the best winning combinations. Aligning three Bonus symbols on the same winning line instead grants access to the Extra Paylines Bonus, which rewards the lucky players with the automatic activation of 6 free spins. In addition, within this game mode, another 20 paylines become active for a total of 60 lines, and when other Extra Paylines symbols appear on reels number 1, 2, and 3, the free spins will be reactivated up to a maximum of 300 times. Thanks to these fantastic special features, the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine is all one needs to relive the glorious times of the Renaissance.\n\nSlots similar to Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play\n\nIf you have already played Da Vinci Diamonds, the previous version of this slot, and want to continue exploring the world of the many geniuses who, like Leonardo, have created truly remarkable wonders, try the Genius slot machine, produced by Capecod. The slot, fun and entertaining, has the great genius Einstein as its main character, who moves inside a laboratory among retorts, formulas, and plasma lamps.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs it possible to try it on a smartphone without an app?\n\nYes, there is absolutely no need to download an app. You can try it directly from your browser without registering.\n\nHow much does the online slot machine pay?\n\nThis title can pay up to 5,000 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine?\n\nThe return to player is 94.3%, well below the average of online slots.\n        ",

This slot offers the possibility of using the Tumbling Reels mode, already present in the original version, twice in the same gaming session. With this function, the icons fall from the top of the game panel and, in case of winning symbol combinations, disappear, leaving room for new symbols to multiply the chances of winning. The slot machine keeps the 5 reels of the basic version but doubles the game panels in a single screen. Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play can thus be defined as a double slot machine with double chances of winning.\n\nGraphics of the slot machine\n\nThe background depicting the Mona Lisa portrait that characterizes the classic version of Da Vinci Diamonds disappears in this new version, leaving room for a homogeneous base in red, highlighted by a luxurious golden frame. Inside the frame, on a green background, the reels appear. There are two game panels, and underneath them, there are the buttons to change the bet value, the display showing the accumulated winnings, and the balance control, the \"Spin\" button to start the reels, and the settings command. With 5 reels, a total of 6 lines, and 40 paylines, this slot dedicated to the great genius still hits the mark. The symbols are the same as in the first version, and in addition to precious stones such as amber, ruby, and emerald, the three famous paintings appear once again: the Mona Lisa, the Musician portrait, and Lady with an Ermine. The solemn background music also accompanies the relaxing wagers on the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine, produced by IGT.\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the slot\n\nIn the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play online slot machine, the symbols that pay less in the winning combinations are the precious gems. The three works of art with the Mona Lisa at the top increase the winnings, being able to pay up to 1000 times the bet. Here, as in the base version of the game, the luckiest symbol in winning combinations is the diamond icon with the writing Da Vinci Diamonds, which can pay up to 5000 times the bet by appearing 5 times on the reels.\n\nThe Wild symbol of the slot, namely the icon showing the homonymous writing, replaces all the other symbols like a joker, except for the Extra Paylines icon, in order to create the best winning combinations. Aligning three Bonus symbols on the same winning line instead grants access to the Extra Paylines Bonus, which rewards the lucky players with the automatic activation of 6 free spins. In addition, within this game mode, another 20 paylines become active for a total of 60 lines, and when other Extra Paylines symbols appear on reels number 1, 2, and 3, the free spins will be reactivated up to a maximum of 300 times. Thanks to these fantastic special features, the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine is all one needs to relive the glorious times of the Renaissance.\n\nSlots similar to Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play\n\nIf you have already played Da Vinci Diamonds, the previous version of this slot, and want to continue exploring the world of the many geniuses who, like Leonardo, have created truly remarkable wonders, try the Genius slot machine, produced by Capecod. The slot, fun and entertaining, has the great genius Einstein as its main character, who moves inside a laboratory among retorts, formulas, and plasma lamps.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs it possible to try it on a smartphone without an app?\n\nYes, there is absolutely no need to download an app. You can try it directly from your browser without registering.\n\nHow much does the online slot machine pay?\n\nThis title can pay up to 5,000 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine?\n\nThe return to player is 94.3%, well below the average of online slots.\n            ",

With this function, the icons fall from the top of the game panel and, in case of winning symbol combinations, disappear, leaving room for new symbols to multiply the chances of winning.\n\nWild symbol and Extra Paylines Bonus feature\n\nThe Wild symbol of the slot, namely the icon showing the homonymous writing, replaces all the other symbols like a joker, except for the Extra Paylines icon, in order to create the best winning combinations. Aligning three Bonus symbols on the same winning line instead grants access to the Extra Paylines Bonus, which rewards the lucky players with the automatic activation of 6 free spins.\n\nDual game panels\n\nDa Vinci Diamonds Dual Play doubles the game panels in a single screen. The slot machine keeps the 5 reels of the basic version and increases the potential number of paylines to 60, doubling the chances of winning.\n\nLuxurious design featuring Da Vinci artwork\n\nThe background of the slot features a red, luxurious golden-frosted frame, surrounded by a green background in which the reels are located. The symbols are the works of art of Leonardo da Vinci, such as the Mona Lisa, the Musician portrait, and Lady with an Ermine, and precious stones like amber, ruby, and emerald.\n\nUp to 300 free spins\n\nThe Extra Paylines Bonus rewards lucky players with the automatic activation of 6 free spins, and another 20 paylines become active for a total of 60 lines. When other Extra Paylines symbols appear on reels number 1, 2, and 3, the free spins will be reactivated up to a maximum of 300 times.\n\nMax payout of 5,000 times the bet\n\nIn the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play online slot machine, the luckiest symbol in winning combinations is the diamond icon with the writing Da Vinci Diamonds, which can pay up to 5,000 times the bet by appearing 5 times on the reels.\n\n        \n            ",

This slot offers the possibility of using the Tumbling Reels mode, already present in the original version, twice in the same gaming session. With this function, the icons fall from the top of the game panel and, in case of winning symbol combinations, disappear, leaving room for new symbols to multiply the chances of winning. The slot machine keeps the 5 reels of the basic version but doubles the game panels in a single screen. Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play can thus be defined as a double slot machine with double chances of winning.\n\nGraphics of the slot machine\n\nThe background depicting the Mona Lisa portrait that characterizes the classic version of Da Vinci Diamonds disappears in this new version, leaving room for a homogeneous base in red, highlighted by a luxurious golden frame. Inside the frame, on a green background, the reels appear. There are two game panels, and underneath them, there are the buttons to change the bet value, the display showing the accumulated winnings, and the balance control, the \"Spin\" button to start the reels, and the settings command. With 5 reels, a total of 6 lines, and 40 paylines, this slot dedicated to the great genius still hits the mark. The symbols are the same as in the first version, and in addition to precious stones such as amber, ruby, and emerald, the three famous paintings appear once again: the Mona Lisa, the Musician portrait, and Lady with an Ermine. The solemn background music also accompanies the relaxing wagers on the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine, produced by IGT.\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the slot\n\nIn the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play online slot machine, the symbols that pay less in the winning combinations are the precious gems. The three works of art with the Mona Lisa at the top increase the winnings, being able to pay up to 1000 times the bet. Here, as in the base version of the game, the luckiest symbol in winning combinations is the diamond icon with the writing Da Vinci Diamonds, which can pay up to 5000 times the bet by appearing 5 times on the reels.\n\nThe Wild symbol of the slot, namely the icon showing the homonymous writing, replaces all the other symbols like a joker, except for the Extra Paylines icon, in order to create the best winning combinations. Aligning three Bonus symbols on the same winning line instead grants access to the Extra Paylines Bonus, which rewards the lucky players with the automatic activation of 6 free spins. In addition, within this game mode, another 20 paylines become active for a total of 60 lines, and when other Extra Paylines symbols appear on reels number 1, 2, and 3, the free spins will be reactivated up to a maximum of 300 times. Thanks to these fantastic special features, the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine is all one needs to relive the glorious times of the Renaissance.\n\nSlots similar to Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play\n\nIf you have already played Da Vinci Diamonds, the previous version of this slot, and want to continue exploring the world of the many geniuses who, like Leonardo, have created truly remarkable wonders, try the Genius slot machine, produced by Capecod. The slot, fun and entertaining, has the great genius Einstein as its main character, who moves inside a laboratory among retorts, formulas, and plasma lamps.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs it possible to try it on a smartphone without an app?\n\nYes, there is absolutely no need to download an app. You can try it directly from your browser without registering.\n\nHow much does the online slot machine pay?\n\nThis title can pay up to 5,000 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine?\n\nThe return to player is 94.3%, well below the average of online slots.\n            ",

Here, as in the base version of the game, the luckiest symbol in winning combinations is the diamond icon with the writing Da Vinci Diamonds, which can pay up to 5000 times the bet by appearing 5 times on the reels.\n\nThe Wild symbol of the slot, namely the icon showing the homonymous writing, replaces all the other symbols like a joker, except for the Extra Paylines icon, in order to create the best winning combinations. Aligning three Bonus symbols on the same winning line instead grants access to the Extra Paylines Bonus, which rewards the lucky players with the automatic activation of 6 free spins. In addition, within this game mode, another 20 paylines become active for a total of 60 lines, and when other Extra Paylines symbols appear on reels number 1, 2, and 3, the free spins will be reactivated up to a maximum of 300 times. Thanks to these fantastic special features, the Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play slot machine is all one needs to relive the glorious times of the Renaissance.\n\nSlots similar to Da Vinci Diamonds Dual Play\n\nIf you have already played Da Vinci Diamonds, the previous version of this slot, and want to continue exploring the world of the many geniuses who, like Leonardo, have created truly remarkable wonders, try the Genius slot machine, produced by Capecod.
