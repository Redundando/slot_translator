This slot offers a mix of classic and modern gameplay mechanics, with a double or nothing feature and a gamble round that allows players to take risks and potentially increase their winnings. The game is relatively easy to play, and it is suitable for both novice and experienced players alike.\n\nEgyptian theme and graphics\n\nFire of Egypt has a classic theme that takes players back to ancient Egypt, with its symbols and artifacts highlighting the rich culture of the Egyptian civilization. The game offers a simple aesthetic design with illustrations that reflect the game's theme. Although the graphics are not innovative, they are effective in capturing the essence of ancient Egyptian culture and traditions.\n\nPaylines and game grid\n\nFire of Egypt has 25 fixed paylines and a 4x4 grid. The game's layout may be a bit unfamiliar to some players who are used to the more conventional 5x3 grid; however, the gameplay mechanics remain similar. The paylines are fixed, which means that players cannot decrease or increase their numbers. The game provides numerous winning combinations that can increase players' winnings, and it is relatively easy to navigate.\n\nSymbols and artifacts\n\nFire of Egypt has various symbols and artifacts that reflect the rich culture of ancient Egypt. The game features pharaoh scepters, fans, and the graphical representations of two famous archaeological artifacts - Tutankhamun's golden sarcophagus, and the head of Queen Nefertiti. The inevitable card symbols (A, K, Q, J) feature prominently in the game, and they are bright and colorful, reflecting Merkur's graphic tradition. The symbols' quality is excellent, and they are easily recognizable.\n\nDouble or nothing feature\n\nFire of Egypt's double or nothing feature allows players to gamble their winnings, either by playing a card game or climbing to higher winnings. While appreciated, this particular feature carries a high risk, and players must use it with caution. Novice players are advised to practice before betting high values.\n\n        \n            ",

Although this is a positive point for the slot, greater attention to detail and more suitable music would have made this slot even more interesting. \nLet's move on to the technical side of the slot in the next point of the review. \nFire of Egypt - Classic and Modern \nIf the visual aspect of this slot pushes the player towards a more classic atmosphere, the same cannot be said of the technical aspect. On the contrary, the game grid and the 25 paylines are much more reminiscent of online slots, albeit with some differences. \nMost digital titles, in fact, use a 5*3 grid, while Merkur has preferred to opt for a less conventional 4*4 slot, with 16 symbols shown in each play. \nThis difference, although subtle, could confuse players who are used to the classic 5*3 grid, which is why we advise you to practice before betting high values. \nFurthermore, after each win, it is usually possible to play a \"double or nothing\" bet, which can take the form of a card game or climbing to the highest winnings. \nAlthough appreciated, this particular feature must be used with caution because of the risk it carries. \nSlots similar to Fire of Egypt \nOnline slots with the theme of the mysterious ancient Egypt abound.

It is clear that the mysteries surrounding the Egyptian civilization not only interest history buffs, but also online slot players. \nMerkur's Fire of Egypt slot presents the theme of ancient Egypt in a rather classic way, without deviating too much from the norm. In this review, we will touch on various aspects of this slot, not only discussing its technical aspects, but also focusing on its visual aspect. \nAnd it is from this last point that the Fire of Egypt review begins. \nFire of Egypt - Graphics \nTrying to propose something extremely innovative in the graphics field can be very difficult and often risky, as it can create confusing or even tacky game grids. \nAs we also mentioned in the introduction, Merkur decides to play it safe and offers us a slot with a rather simple aesthetic look, starting with the background which is nothing more than a wooden slab, rather than stone, decorated with Egyptian bas-reliefs. \nThe inevitable playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J) are very bright in Merkur's graphic tradition. But they are not the only symbols present on the slot, as we will also find the typical pharaoh scepters, the fan, and the graphical representation of two archaeological artifacts famous all over the world: Tutankhamun's golden sarcophagus and the head of Queen Nefertiti. \nCompared to many other slots in the same production company, Fire of Egypt does not use 3D models but illustrations, although they are quite simple. \nFire of Egypt is a slot that focuses more on simplicity and immediacy. Although this is a positive point for the slot, greater attention to detail and more suitable music would have made this slot even more interesting. \nLet's move on to the technical side of the slot in the next point of the review. \nFire of Egypt - Classic and Modern \nIf the visual aspect of this slot pushes the player towards a more classic atmosphere, the same cannot be said of the technical aspect. On the contrary, the game grid and the 25 paylines are much more reminiscent of online slots, albeit with some differences. \nMost digital titles, in fact, use a 5*3 grid, while Merkur has preferred to opt for a less conventional 4*4 slot, with 16 symbols shown in each play. \nThis difference, although subtle, could confuse players who are used to the classic 5*3 grid, which is why we advise you to practice before betting high values. \nFurthermore, after each win, it is usually possible to play a \"double or nothing\" bet, which can take the form of a card game or climbing to the highest winnings. \nAlthough appreciated, this particular feature must be used with caution because of the risk it carries. \nSlots similar to Fire of Egypt \nOnline slots with the theme of the mysterious ancient Egypt abound. Among these, we can mention slots such as: Queen of the Nile II, Cleopatra, Riches of Ra, Pyramid Quest for Immortality, or the singular Egyptian Heroes.\n        ",
