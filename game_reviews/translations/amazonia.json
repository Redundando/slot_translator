Ma vediamolo più nel dettaglio, nella nostra recensione.\nAmazonia – Grafica\nLa griglia di gioco, si presenta nello sfondo della verde foresta Amazzonica.\nCome accade nella maggior parte delle slot online, troviamo i simboli delle carte da gioco (A, K, Q, J) di colore molto vivace e che sembrano intagliati nel legno. Il resto dei simboli, invece, rappresentano alcuni animali amazzonici come la raganella, il camaleonte, il giaguaro nero e il pappagallo ara.\nInvece delle illustrazioni in due dimensioni la casa di produzione Merkur ha scelto dei modelli 3D. Questi, però, sembrano datati e durante le animazioni questi appaiono piuttosto goffi e meccanici.\nPer quanto riguarda il sonoro, la slot non ha nessun sottofondo musicale se non per un jingle con una musica tribale che potremo sentire solo durante le combinazioni.\nIn sostanza: Amazonia per quanto appaia colorata e appariscente, non riesce a nascondere una grafica datata e un comparto sonoro quasi inesistente. Ma è evidente che Amazonia voglia proporre qualcosa di semplice e concentrarsi sul gameplay, come andremo a vedere nel prossimo punto della recensione.\nAmazonia – Gameplay\nLa slot Amazonia è una classica 5×3 e con 15 linee di vincita. Il simbolo Wild è rappresentato da una donna indigena mentre gli Scatter sono un antico tempio e una cascata.\nLa donna indigena andrà a sostituire i simboli sulla griglia durante le combinazioni eccetto per i due Scatter. Se si troveranno tre templi o due cascate, i simboli Scatter attiveranno la vincita Mistery che può essere sia accettata, facendo finire la giocata, oppure rifiutata per tentare nuovamente la fortuna.\nUn altro simbolo degno di nota è il giaguaro nero. Se vengono trovati 5 simboli giaguaro nero sulla stessa linea, si avrà diritto a dei giri gratuiti che vanno da un minimo di 2 fino a un massimo di 6 e che a loro volta, moltiplicheranno le vincite da un minimo di 2 a un massimo di 5.\nAmazonia dà anche ulteriori possibilità con due mini-game che si attiveranno dopo le vincite. Potremo scegliere la carta della fortuna o la scala della fortuna. Il primo mini-game consiste nel prevedere quale sarà il colore della carta successiva, mentre la scala della fortuna è letteralmente una scalata a vincite più alte.\nIn questo caso si può dire che la slot Amazonia viene salvata dalla sua grafica non propriamente eccelsa, con il suo gameplay piuttosto variegato e le molteplici possibilità di vincita fra combinazioni e mini-game.\nSlot simili ad Amazonia\nPossiamo trovare il tema della foresta amazzonica e le sue popolazioni, anche in altre slot online quali: Amazon Adventure, Amazon Wild, Amazing Amazonia ed Amazon Queen.\n",

Its unparalleled biodiversity has inspired many cinematic and literary works, thanks to the mysteries that lie within the dense forest itself.\nAmazonia by Merkur, is a slot that draws heavily from the wonderful forest to offer us something unusual. Let's take a closer look at it in our review.\n\nAmazonia – Graphics:\nThe game grid is set against the backdrop of the lush Amazon rainforest. As with most online slots, we find the colourful playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J), which seem to be carved out of wood. The rest of the symbols represent some Amazonian animals such as the tree frog, chameleon, black jaguar and macaw parrot. Instead of two-dimensional illustrations, the production house Merkur has opted for 3D models. However, these look dated and during the animations they appear rather clumsy and mechanical. As for the sound, the slot has no background music except for a tribal jingle that we can only hear during combinations.\n\nIn summary: Amazonia, despite its colourful and flashy appearance, fails to conceal its dated graphics and almost non-existent sound. But it's clear that Amazonia wants to offer something simple and focus on gameplay, as we'll see in the next point of the review.\n\nAmazonia - Gameplay:\nThe Amazonia slot is a classic 5x3 and has 15 paylines. The Wild symbol is represented by an indigenous woman while the Scatters are an ancient temple and a waterfall. The indigenous woman will replace the symbols on the grid during combinations except for the two Scatters. If three temples or two waterfalls are found, the Scatter symbols will activate the Mystery win, which can be either accepted, ending the game or rejected to try your luck again. Another notable symbol is the black jaguar. If 5 black jaguar symbols are found on the same line, players are entitled to free spins ranging from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 6, and which in turn, multiply winnings from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 5. Amazonia also offers additional opportunities with two mini-games that will be triggered after each win. Players can choose the fortune card or the fortune ladder. The first mini-game consists of predicting the colour of the next card, while the fortune ladder is literally a climb to higher winnings. In this case, it can be said that the Amazonia slot is saved by its not particularly remarkable graphics, with its rather varied gameplay and multiple winning possibilities between combinations and mini-games.\n\nSimilar slots to Amazonia include: Amazon Adventure, Amazon Wild, Amazing Amazonia, and Amazon Queen.\n            ",

The slot offers players opportunities to win big through a number of symbols including the Wild symbol which is represented by an indigenous woman while the Scatters are an ancient temple and a waterfall. The slot also offers exciting mini-games to enhance gameplay and winning possibilities.\n\nFeatures and symbols\n\nAmazonia has a number of unique and exciting symbols. In addition to the Wild and Scatter symbols, there are also symbols representing Amazonian animals such as the tree frog, chameleon, and macaw parrot. Players can also benefit from the black jaguar symbol which offers free spins ranging from 2 to 6 and multiplies winnings from 2 to 5. There are also two mini-games available for players to choose from after each win - the fortune card or the fortune ladder.\n\nGameplay and winning possibilities\n\nAlthough the graphics are not particularly remarkable, Amazonia offers varied gameplay with a number of winning possibilities including multiple winning combinations and mini-games. Players can also benefit from free spins and the opportunity to multiply their winnings. Overall, the slot offers an exciting and immersive gaming experience.\n\nSimilar slot games\n\nIf you enjoy Amazonia, other popular slot games with a similar Amazonian theme include Amazon Adventure, Amazon Wild, Amazing Amazonia, and Amazon Queen. These slots offer players a chance to explore the beauty and biodiversity of the Amazon Rainforest while also offering exciting gameplay and winning possibilities.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nWhile the slot is set in the lush Amazon Rainforest, the graphics and design of Amazonia are not particularly remarkable and appear dated in comparison to other modern slot games. The 3D models used for the animal symbols can appear clumsy and mechanical. While the slot has no background music, there are simple sound effects that enhance the overall gaming experience.\n\n        \n            ",

Its unparalleled biodiversity has inspired many cinematic and literary works, thanks to the mysteries that lie within the dense forest itself.\nAmazonia by Merkur, is a slot that draws heavily from the wonderful forest to offer us something unusual. Let's take a closer look at it in our review.\n\nAmazonia – Graphics:\nThe game grid is set against the backdrop of the lush Amazon rainforest. As with most online slots, we find the colourful playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J), which seem to be carved out of wood. The rest of the symbols represent some Amazonian animals such as the tree frog, chameleon, black jaguar and macaw parrot. Instead of two-dimensional illustrations, the production house Merkur has opted for 3D models. However, these look dated and during the animations they appear rather clumsy and mechanical. As for the sound, the slot has no background music except for a tribal jingle that we can only hear during combinations.\n\nIn summary: Amazonia, despite its colourful and flashy appearance, fails to conceal its dated graphics and almost non-existent sound. But it's clear that Amazonia wants to offer something simple and focus on gameplay, as we'll see in the next point of the review.\n\nAmazonia - Gameplay:\nThe Amazonia slot is a classic 5x3 and has 15 paylines. The Wild symbol is represented by an indigenous woman while the Scatters are an ancient temple and a waterfall. The indigenous woman will replace the symbols on the grid during combinations except for the two Scatters. If three temples or two waterfalls are found, the Scatter symbols will activate the Mystery win, which can be either accepted, ending the game or rejected to try your luck again. Another notable symbol is the black jaguar. If 5 black jaguar symbols are found on the same line, players are entitled to free spins ranging from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 6, and which in turn, multiply winnings from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 5. Amazonia also offers additional opportunities with two mini-games that will be triggered after each win. Players can choose the fortune card or the fortune ladder. The first mini-game consists of predicting the colour of the next card, while the fortune ladder is literally a climb to higher winnings. In this case, it can be said that the Amazonia slot is saved by its not particularly remarkable graphics, with its rather varied gameplay and multiple winning possibilities between combinations and mini-games.\n\nSimilar slots to Amazonia include: Amazon Adventure, Amazon Wild, Amazing Amazonia, and Amazon Queen.\n            ",

Its unparalleled biodiversity has inspired many cinematic and literary works, thanks to the mysteries that lie within the dense forest itself.\nAmazonia by Merkur, is a slot that draws heavily from the wonderful forest to offer us something unusual. Let's take a closer look at it in our review.\n\nAmazonia – Graphics:\nThe game grid is set against the backdrop of the lush Amazon rainforest. As with most online slots, we find the colourful playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J), which seem to be carved out of wood. The rest of the symbols represent some Amazonian animals such as the tree frog, chameleon, black jaguar and macaw parrot. Instead of two-dimensional illustrations, the production house Merkur has opted for 3D models. However, these look dated and during the animations they appear rather clumsy and mechanical. As for the sound, the slot has no background music except for a tribal jingle that we can only hear during combinations.\n\nIn summary: Amazonia, despite its colourful and flashy appearance, fails to conceal its dated graphics and almost non-existent sound. But it's clear that Amazonia wants to offer something simple and focus on gameplay, as we'll see in the next point of the review.\n\nAmazonia - Gameplay:\nThe Amazonia slot is a classic 5x3 and has 15 paylines. The Wild symbol is represented by an indigenous woman while the Scatters are an ancient temple and a waterfall. The indigenous woman will replace the symbols on the grid during combinations except for the two Scatters. If three temples or two waterfalls are found, the Scatter symbols will activate the Mystery win, which can be either accepted, ending the game or rejected to try your luck again. Another notable symbol is the black jaguar. If 5 black jaguar symbols are found on the same line, players are entitled to free spins ranging from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 6, and which in turn, multiply winnings from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 5. Amazonia also offers additional opportunities with two mini-games that will be triggered after each win. Players can choose the fortune card or the fortune ladder. The first mini-game consists of predicting the colour of the next card, while the fortune ladder is literally a climb to higher winnings. In this case, it can be said that the Amazonia slot is saved by its not particularly remarkable graphics, with its rather varied gameplay and multiple winning possibilities between combinations and mini-games.\n\nSimilar slots to Amazonia include: Amazon Adventure, Amazon Wild, Amazing Amazonia, and Amazon Queen.\n        ",
