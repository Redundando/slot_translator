If you're lucky enough to see a win involving this symbol in 25 or more cases, the prize you can tell your friends is 100x multiplied by the triggering bet.\n\nRegardless of the symbol with which the win was made, the wild symbol in the cluster causes the winning results to get a 1x multiplier for each cascade win. While in the winning zone, the wild symbol remains on the grid for the next symbols to fall and moves one place to the left or right.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nYou have chosen Alien Antix probably because you like stories about extraterrestrial life forms. Then you will certainly know Aliens, the famous movie. The eponymous slot machine is Aliens and is produced by NetEnt: it offers you 3D graphics and extremely interesting features.\n        ",

The highest wins are made with 25 or more of the same symbol. Experienced gamblers will find this game fun to play. The game has 64 square grids that offer cascading drops and a high variance. The maximum payout is 50,000x.\n\nGameplay Features and Symbols\n\nApart from the wild, there are extras such as win multipliers, a free spin bonus, and colossal symbols. Cascading or explosive wins make the game more interesting. In addition to forming clusters, colossal symbols and wilds help to increase the chances of winning. The free spin bonus called Colossal Capers Free Spins offers eight free spins and colossal alien heads.\n\nFree Spin Bonus and Variance\n\nAlien Antix offers a free spin bonus called Colossal Capers Free Spins. It is triggered by the wild symbol and offers eight free spins. Each free spin gets a colossal alien head. The wild symbol in the winning cluster results in a 1x multiplier for each cascade win. The game has high variance.\n\nGraphics and Animations\n\nBlueprint has done an excellent job creating Alien Antix. The creatures show a life of their own, with expressions ranging from amazement to shock to smile. Every winning outcome is made known by a light effect that evaporates the symbols. Colossal symbols create their own light effect and are a delight that is hoped to be seen as often as possible. The game's background shows a volatile corner of space with meteors exploding the surface of the underlying planet. Bizarre space objects float around, and there is a galactic vortex spinning in its place.\n\nOther Similar Space-Themed Slot Games\n\nIf you're a fan of space-themed slot games, you may enjoy Aliens, the eponymous slot machine produced by NetEnt.

To form a winning cluster, five or more alien creatures must occur adjacent to each other on horizontal or vertical rows. Colossal symbols, a wild that substitutes any symbol and triggers the free spin bonus, and win multipliers are some of the features that make gameplay exciting.\n\nSymbol combinations\n\nTo win, you must form clusters of five or more alien creatures on horizontal or vertical rows. The orange cyclops alien is the most valuable symbol on the reels and can multiply your triggering bet by 100x if you get a win involving 25 or more symbols of this type. The wild symbol is an atom with its electrons in constant rotation. It substitutes any symbol and triggers the free spin bonus.\n\nBonus rounds\n\nThe free spin bonus in Alien Antix is called Colossal Capers Free Spins. To trigger it, you need three wild symbols, which activate eight free spins. Colossal symbols feature heavily in this bonus, with each individual free spin receiving a giant alien head. The wild symbol stays on the grid for the next symbols to fall and moves one place to the left or right, allowing for further cluster wins and cascade wins with 1x multipliers.\n\nVariance and payout\n\nAlien Antix has high variance, meaning that players could experience huge wins or significant losses. The maximum payout is 50,000x, which is impressive and tempting. Cluster wins start from five symbols of the same type, and the wild symbol can significantly improve these results. The game's RTP is 96.49%, which is quite favorable.\n\nSimilar games\n\nIf you enjoy themes about extraterrestrial life forms, the Aliens slot game produced by NetEnt is an excellent option to check out. It offers 3D graphics and exciting features, similar to Alien Antix. Other great options include Starburst and Moon Princess, both developed by Play'n GO and offering exciting gameplay with bonuses, cluster wins, and high payouts.\n\n        \n            ",

The game has 64 square grids that offer cascading drops. A wild substitute for any and triggers the free spin bonus, and colossal symbols make their mark on the game. The maximum payout is 50,000x, and the game has high variance.\n\nExperienced gamblers will find this game fun to play. You'll need to see five or more of these alien creatures occurring on horizontal or vertical rows and adjacent to each other to form a winning cluster. The highest wins are made with 25 or more of the same.\n\nAn Extraterrestrial Slot Machine\n\nIn addition to the wild, without which Alien Antix would be unnamed, there are extras like win multipliers, a free spin bonus, and colossal symbols.\n\nPlus, but not unexpectedly, are cascading or explosive wins. Call them what you like, these detract from winning results and add new symbols for the chance of another win.\n\nBlueprint has some great productions under its belt, and this game is no exception. The creatures show a life of their own, with expressions ranging from amazement to shock to smile. Every winning outcome is made known by a light effect that evaporates the symbols.\n\nColossal symbols create their own light effect and are a delight that is hoped to be seen as often as possible. Meanwhile, the background of the Alien Antix slot shows a volatile corner of space with meteors exploding the surface of the underlying planet. Bizarre space objects float around, and there is a galactic vortex spinning in its place.\n\nAll of this is bizarre but very fun and potentially rewarding for lucky players.\n\nSlot Functions and Symbols\n\nOne of the extras of this game is the colossal symbols. These can be all alien heads on the payout table, but the essential difference is that they can occupy a rather substantial part of the reel-set.\n\nAnother feature of the Alien Antix slot is the free spin bonus called Colossal Capers Free Spins. Since there are no other symbols except those of aliens and the wild, it is that symbol that can trigger the bonus.\n\nWe need three of the same to get 8 free spins. The kick-off is that each individual free spin gets a colossal alien head.\n\nAs we said, cluster wins start from five symbols of the same type, and the wild can certainly help with these results. That symbol is an atom and its electrons in their eternal rotation.\n\nThe most valuable symbol on the reels is the orange cyclops alien. If you're lucky enough to see a win involving this symbol in 25 or more cases, the prize you can tell your friends is 100x multiplied by the triggering bet.\n\nRegardless of the symbol with which the win was made, the wild symbol in the cluster causes the winning results to get a 1x multiplier for each cascade win. While in the winning zone, the wild symbol remains on the grid for the next symbols to fall and moves one place to the left or right.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nYou have chosen Alien Antix probably because you like stories about extraterrestrial life forms. Then you will certainly know Aliens, the famous movie. The eponymous slot machine is Aliens and is produced by NetEnt: it offers you 3D graphics and extremely interesting features.\n            ",

The game has 64 square grids that offer cascading drops. A wild substitute for any and triggers the free spin bonus, and colossal symbols make their mark on the game. The maximum payout is 50,000x, and the game has high variance.\n\nExperienced gamblers will find this game fun to play. You'll need to see five or more of these alien creatures occurring on horizontal or vertical rows and adjacent to each other to form a winning cluster. The highest wins are made with 25 or more of the same.\n\nAn Extraterrestrial Slot Machine\n\nIn addition to the wild, without which Alien Antix would be unnamed, there are extras like win multipliers, a free spin bonus, and colossal symbols.\n\nPlus, but not unexpectedly, are cascading or explosive wins. Call them what you like, these detract from winning results and add new symbols for the chance of another win.\n\nBlueprint has some great productions under its belt, and this game is no exception. The creatures show a life of their own, with expressions ranging from amazement to shock to smile. Every winning outcome is made known by a light effect that evaporates the symbols.\n\nColossal symbols create their own light effect and are a delight that is hoped to be seen as often as possible. Meanwhile, the background of the Alien Antix slot shows a volatile corner of space with meteors exploding the surface of the underlying planet. Bizarre space objects float around, and there is a galactic vortex spinning in its place.\n\nAll of this is bizarre but very fun and potentially rewarding for lucky players.\n\nSlot Functions and Symbols\n\nOne of the extras of this game is the colossal symbols. These can be all alien heads on the payout table, but the essential difference is that they can occupy a rather substantial part of the reel-set.\n\nAnother feature of the Alien Antix slot is the free spin bonus called Colossal Capers Free Spins. Since there are no other symbols except those of aliens and the wild, it is that symbol that can trigger the bonus.\n\nWe need three of the same to get 8 free spins. The kick-off is that each individual free spin gets a colossal alien head.\n\nAs we said, cluster wins start from five symbols of the same type, and the wild can certainly help with these results. That symbol is an atom and its electrons in their eternal rotation.\n\nThe most valuable symbol on the reels is the orange cyclops alien. If you're lucky enough to see a win involving this symbol in 25 or more cases, the prize you can tell your friends is 100x multiplied by the triggering bet.\n\nRegardless of the symbol with which the win was made, the wild symbol in the cluster causes the winning results to get a 1x multiplier for each cascade win. While in the winning zone, the wild symbol remains on the grid for the next symbols to fall and moves one place to the left or right.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nYou have chosen Alien Antix probably because you like stories about extraterrestrial life forms. Then you will certainly know Aliens, the famous movie. The eponymous slot machine is Aliens and is produced by NetEnt: it offers you 3D graphics and extremely interesting features.\n            ",
