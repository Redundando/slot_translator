With an RTP of 96.45%, the maximum win is 10,000x your bet.\n\nGiza Infinity Reels is an online slot by ReelPlay that offers players an infinite number of ways to win as the reels expand to provide great potential. With an impressive prize of 10,000x and medium/high volatility, it has an RTP of 96.45%.\n\nTravel back in time with stunning graphics fit for experienced gamblers. The game focuses on the last of ancient Seven Wonders of the World, with high-quality 3D graphics and an engaging soundtrack. Symbols include the Ankh crosses, the Eye of Ra, lotus flowers, and other artifacts of ancient Egypt. You will also see the deities Horus (Falcon God), Maahes (Lion God), Sobek (Alligator God), and Anubis (Jackal God). And of course, you will see the Great Pyramid in the background.\n\nAnubi and the pyramid are the highest value symbols that pay out 5 times your bet if you land 5 or more in combination. The scarab beetle is the wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the pyramid.\n\nDespite the potential of infinite reels, Giza Infinity Reels looks superb on mobile and tablet devices as well as on desktop. This is because the screen moves to the right every time a new reel is added. You can play with devices that use iOS, Android, or Windows operating systems.\n\nGiza Infinity Reels is an Egypt mythology-based online slot. The game has an intriguing aesthetic with fantasy style graphics depicting Egyptian deities. Overall, the game looks engaging and leaves you wanting to spin the reels to see more.\n\nGiza Infinity Reels starts with 3 reels and 4 rows. It uses ReelPlay Infinity Reels mechanic that was first introduced in the El Dorado Infinity Reels slot. Each win sees the addition of another reel - the Symbol Multiplier feature also applies, which sees the multiplier increase by 1.\n\nSubsequent wins continue to add reels and increase the multiplier, with no limits. When you have a losing spin, the reels return to the standard 3x4 layout. Symbols pay from left to right wherever there are 5 or more matching symbols.\n\nAs far as stakes are concerned, you can play from a minimum of 20 cents up to 25 euros per spin. There is an Autoplay feature where you can simply choose between 10 and 100 spins. In Settings, you can activate the Quick Play option and play with the sound and background sound on or off.\n\nGiza Infinity Reels slot is a medium to high variance title, which means that most wins will be of smaller sizes. The biggest wins come with the reels you play with. The maximum win for the base game round is 1,245x your bet. In the Free Spins feature, the maximum win is 10,000x your bet. The RTP is 96.45%, which is above average for an online slot game.\n\nPay attention to the pyramid symbol during the base game, as a win with it triggers the Free Spins feature. With 10 free spins assigned, the symbol multiplier plays an important role.\n\nIn the base game, the symbol multiplier increase is 1 every time. In the Free Spins feature, it can increase up to a maximum of 5. For example - if you have a 5x multiplier and you get a win, it can increase up to 5, giving you a 10x multiplier.\n\nIn a free spin without a winning combination, the symbol multiplier decreases by 1. Pay attention to the pyramid symbol that appears during the feature because this adds 4 extra free spins to your count.\n\nThe way winning combinations are made in this game is quite unique. As long as you land five or more matching symbols, you receive a win that is equal to the number of symbols multiplied by their value, and then multiplied by your bet.\n\nIf any of the winning symbols appear on the rightmost reel, then the reels will expand. This is where the Infinity Reels come into play. The reels will spin again with additional winning modes, and if another winning symbol lands on that new reel, it will expand again. As long as you keep landing winning symbols, the reels will continue to expand. Each time they do, your multiplier increases.\n\nThe reason why this bonus is called Infinity Reel is that there is no limit to the number of times the reels can expand. They can simply keep going and going, awarding you with bigger and better prizes along the way.\n\nFor similar online slot games, try Eye of Horus, which has a standard layout of five reels and three rows spinning on ten paylines, as well as bonus features that can elevate your gameplay by a notch or few, increasing the odds for bigger wins. Play Eye of Horus starting with just €0.01 per payline.",

Nel complesso, l’aspetto del gioco è intrigante e ti fa venire voglia di far girare i rulli per vedere di più.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nGiza: Infinity Reels inizia con 3 bobine e 4 file. Utilizza la meccanica di ReelPlay Infinity Reels che è stata introdotta per la prima volta nella slot El Dorado Infinity Reels. Ogni vittoria vede l’aggiunta di un’altra bobina – si applica anche la funzione Symbol Multiplier che vede il moltiplicatore aumentare di 1.\nLe vincite successive continuano ad aggiungere bobine e ad aumentare il moltiplicatore, senza limiti. Quando si ottiene un giro perdente, le bobine tornano al layout standard 3×4. I simboli pagano da sinistra a destra dove ci sono 5 o più simboli corrispondenti.\nPer quanto riguarda la posta in gioco, si può giocare da un minimo di 20 centesimi fino a 25 euro a giro. C’è una funzione Autoplay dove si può semplicemente scegliere tra 10 e 100 giri. In Impostazioni, è possibile attivare l’opzione Quick Play e giocare con il suono e il suono di sottofondo attivo o disattivato.\nIl Giza: Infinity Reels slot è un titolo a varianza medio-alta, il che significa che la maggior parte delle vittorie saranno di dimensioni più piccole. Le vittorie più grandi si ottengono con le bobine con cui si gioca. La vincita massima per giro di gioco base è di 1.245 x la vostra puntata. Nella funzione Free Spins, la vincita massima è di 10.000 x la vostra puntata. L’RTP è del 96,45% che è superiore alla media per un gioco di slot online.\nFate attenzione al simbolo della piramide durante il gioco di base, perché una vincita con esso farà scattare la funzione Free Spins. Con 10 giri gratuiti assegnati, il moltiplicatore di simboli gioca un ruolo importante.\nNel gioco di base, l’incremento del moltiplicatore di simboli è di 1 ogni volta. Nella funzione Giri liberi, può aumentare fino ad un massimo di 5. Ad esempio – se si dispone di un moltiplicatore 5x e si ottiene una vittoria, può aumentare fino a 5, ottenendo un moltiplicatore 10x.\nIn un giro gratis senza combinazione vincente, il moltiplicatore di simboli diminuisce di 1. Fate attenzione al simbolo della piramide che appare durante la funzione, perché questo aggiungerà 4 giri gratis extra al vostro conteggio.\nIl modo in cui vengono realizzate le combinazioni vincenti in questo gioco è piuttosto unico. Finché atterrate cinque o più simboli corrispondenti, riceverete una vincita che è uguale al numero di simboli moltiplicato per il loro valore, e poi moltiplicato per la vostra scommessa.\nSe uno qualsiasi dei simboli vincenti appare nella bobina più a destra, allora le bobine si espanderanno. È qui che entrano in gioco i rulli Infinity Reels. Le bobine gireranno di nuovo con le modalità di vincita extra e, se un altro simbolo vincente atterra in quella nuova bobina, si espanderà di nuovo. Finché continuerete a far atterrare i simboli vincenti, le bobine continueranno ad espandersi. Ogni volta che lo faranno, il vostro moltiplicatore aumenterà.\nIl motivo per cui questo bonus è chiamato Infinity Reel è che non c’è limite al numero di volte in cui i rulli possono espandersi. Possono semplicemente continuare ad andare avanti e andare avanti, assegnandovi premi più grandi e migliori lungo il percorso.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nLa slot Eye of Horus ha una disposizione standard di cinque rulli e tre file che girano su dieci linee di pagamento e ci sono caratteristiche bonus che possono elevare la vostra esperienza di gioco di una tacca o poche più alte aumentando le probabilità per le vincite più grandi. Gioca a Eye of Horus con solo €0,01 per linea di pagamento.\n\n        ",

You will also see the Great Pyramid.\nAnubis and the pyramid are the highest paying symbols, paying 5x your stake if you land 5 or more in combination. The scarab beetle is the wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the pyramid.\n\nDespite the potential for infinite reels, Giza: Infinity Reels looks superb on mobile and tablet devices, as well as on desktop. This is because the screen moves to the right with each new reel added. You can play on devices that run on iOS, Android or Windows operating systems.\n\nGiza Infinity Reels is an online slot based on Egyptian mythology. The game has an interesting aesthetic with a fantasy-style graphics featuring Egyptian deities. Overall, the look of the game is intriguing and makes you want to spin the reels to see more.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine – Giza Infinity Reels starts with 3 reels and 4 rows. It uses the ReelPlay Infinity Reels mechanics, which was introduced for the first time in the El Dorado Infinity Reels slot. Each win adds another reel - the Symbol Multiplier feature also applies, which sees the multiplier increase by 1.\n\nSubsequent wins continue to add reels and increase the multiplier, with no limits. When you get a losing spin, the reels return to the standard 3×4 layout. Symbols pay from left to right where there are 5 or more matching symbols.\n\nRegarding the stake, you can play from a minimum of 20 cents up to 25 euros per spin. There is an Autoplay feature where you can simply choose between 10 and 100 spins. In Settings, you can activate the Quick Play option and play with background sound and sound on or off.\n\nThe Giza: Infinity Reels slot is a medium/high variance title, which means that most wins will be smaller in size. The bigger wins come with the reels you play with. The maximum win per base game spin is 1,245x your bet. In the Free Spins feature, the maximum win is 10,000x your bet. The RTP is 96.45%, which is above average for an online slot game.\n\nWatch out for the pyramid symbol during the base game, as a win with it will trigger the Free Spins feature. With 10 free spins awarded, the symbol multiplier plays a significant role.\n\nIn the base game, the symbol multiplier increase is 1 each time. In the Free Spins feature, it can increase up to a maximum of 5. For example - if you have a 5x multiplier and get a win, it can increase up to 5, giving you a 10x multiplier.\n\nIn a free spin without a winning combination, the symbol multiplier decreases by 1. Watch out for the pyramid symbol that appears during the feature, as it adds 4 extra free spins to your count.\n\nThe way winning combinations are made in this game is quite unique. As long as you land five or more matching symbols, you will receive a win that is equal to the number of symbols multiplied by their value, and then multiplied by your bet.\n\nIf any of the winning symbols appear in the rightmost reel, then the reels will expand. This is where the Infinity Reels come into play. The reels will spin again with the extra winning ways, and if another winning symbol lands in that new reel, it will expand again. As long as you keep landing winning symbols, the reels will keep expanding. Each time they do, your multiplier will increase.\n\nThe reason this bonus is called the Infinity Reel is that there is no limit to how many times the reels can expand. They can simply keep going and going, awarding you bigger and better prizes along the way.\n\nOther similar slot machines include Eye of Horus, which has a standard layout of five reels and three rows spinning on ten paylines, and there are bonus features that can elevate your gameplay a notch or few higher by increasing the odds for bigger wins. Play Eye of Horus starting at just €0.01 per payline.\n            ",

Symbols pay from left to right where there are five or more matching symbols. The game uses the ReelPlay Infinity Reels mechanics, which means that the more reels that are added, the higher your chances of winning and reaping huge rewards.\n\nGraphics\n\nGiza Infinity Reels is based on ancient Egyptian mythology, with graphics that are top-notch and stunning. It features a high-quality 3D graphics design that depicts the ancient Egyptian world perfectly.

If you land the pyramid symbol again during the Free Spins feature, you get four extra free spins, providing even more chances to bag your winnings.\n\nCompatibility\n\nGiza Infinity Reels is playable on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets, as well as desktops that run on iOS, Android or Windows operating systems. The game's design ensures a seamless experience regardless of the device or system used to play, adding to the accessibility and enjoyment of players.\n\n        \n            ",

You will also see the deities Horus (Falcon God), Maahes (Lion God), Sobek (Alligator God), and Anubis (Jackal God). You will also see the Great Pyramid.\nAnubis and the pyramid are the highest paying symbols, paying 5x your stake if you land 5 or more in combination. The scarab beetle is the wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the pyramid.\n\nDespite the potential for infinite reels, Giza: Infinity Reels looks superb on mobile and tablet devices, as well as on desktop. This is because the screen moves to the right with each new reel added. You can play on devices that run on iOS, Android or Windows operating systems.\n\nGiza Infinity Reels is an online slot based on Egyptian mythology. The game has an interesting aesthetic with a fantasy-style graphics featuring Egyptian deities. Overall, the look of the game is intriguing and makes you want to spin the reels to see more.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine – Giza Infinity Reels starts with 3 reels and 4 rows. It uses the ReelPlay Infinity Reels mechanics, which was introduced for the first time in the El Dorado Infinity Reels slot. Each win adds another reel - the Symbol Multiplier feature also applies, which sees the multiplier increase by 1.\n\nSubsequent wins continue to add reels and increase the multiplier, with no limits. When you get a losing spin, the reels return to the standard 3×4 layout. Symbols pay from left to right where there are 5 or more matching symbols.\n\nRegarding the stake, you can play from a minimum of 20 cents up to 25 euros per spin. There is an Autoplay feature where you can simply choose between 10 and 100 spins. In Settings, you can activate the Quick Play option and play with background sound and sound on or off.\n\nThe Giza: Infinity Reels slot is a medium/high variance title, which means that most wins will be smaller in size. The bigger wins come with the reels you play with. The maximum win per base game spin is 1,245x your bet. In the Free Spins feature, the maximum win is 10,000x your bet. The RTP is 96.45%, which is above average for an online slot game.\n\nWatch out for the pyramid symbol during the base game, as a win with it will trigger the Free Spins feature. With 10 free spins awarded, the symbol multiplier plays a significant role.\n\nIn the base game, the symbol multiplier increase is 1 each time. In the Free Spins feature, it can increase up to a maximum of 5. For example - if you have a 5x multiplier and get a win, it can increase up to 5, giving you a 10x multiplier.\n\nIn a free spin without a winning combination, the symbol multiplier decreases by 1. Watch out for the pyramid symbol that appears during the feature, as it adds 4 extra free spins to your count.\n\nThe way winning combinations are made in this game is quite unique. As long as you land five or more matching symbols, you will receive a win that is equal to the number of symbols multiplied by their value, and then multiplied by your bet.\n\nIf any of the winning symbols appear in the rightmost reel, then the reels will expand. This is where the Infinity Reels come into play. The reels will spin again with the extra winning ways, and if another winning symbol lands in that new reel, it will expand again. As long as you keep landing winning symbols, the reels will keep expanding. Each time they do, your multiplier will increase.\n\nThe reason this bonus is called the Infinity Reel is that there is no limit to how many times the reels can expand. They can simply keep going and going, awarding you bigger and better prizes along the way.\n\nOther similar slot machines include Eye of Horus, which has a standard layout of five reels and three rows spinning on ten paylines, and there are bonus features that can elevate your gameplay a notch or few higher by increasing the odds for bigger wins. Play Eye of Horus starting at just €0.01 per payline.\n            ",
