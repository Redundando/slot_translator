Could a slot game be missing to celebrate this event? Espresso Games, an Italian software house, has thought of it and created a product that celebrates the national sport of Italy!\n\nSince 2002, Espresso Games has distinguished itself for its extremely meticulous graphics and attention to detail, which we can also admire in #90 Spins. At the start of the game, we find ourselves walking down the locker room corridor as if we were players ourselves, until we arrive on the green field, where we will be asked to choose our favorite team and make our first bet on the result. The graphics are very realistic, and #90 Spins looks more like a PlayStation game than a slot machine!\n\nRecommended especially for football fans, but also incredibly entertaining for everyone else! \n\nMain features of the slot machine: When we open #90 Spins, we are faced with a rather unusual game screen: the screen is divided into two halves, each corresponding to a team. Each \"team\" has three reels and five rows, for a total of six reels. At the beginning of the game, we must make a prediction on the result, betting on which half the winning spins will concentrate. #90 Spins offers 6,784 ways to win, a gameplay system that pays both from left to right and vice versa, double wild reels, free spins, and a final bonus to convince even the most skeptical!\n\n#90 Spins opens with a predefined coin bet, which can be changed using the \"COIN VALUE\" and \"STEP\" buttons. Symbols and special features of #90 Spins: The symbols that alternate on the reels of #90 Spins are divided into regular and special. We find both the so-called \"reals\", the numbers and letters that correspond to playing cards from 10 to Ace, as well as thematic symbols obviously related to the world of football, including a football shoe, a captain's armband, a goalkeeper's glove saving the ball, the cup, and the corner flag.\n\nThere are two wild symbols, represented by players of two opposing teams, which can appear on the third and fourth reels and cover the entire reel on which they appear. There is also a Free Spins symbol, which can only be found on the first and sixth reels, and allows access to a variable number of free spins. The choice of the team at the start of the game must be maintained for 90 minutes (spins): each regular spin increases the timer by one minute and adds 10% of the bet to the personal accumulator. At the end of the 90 spins, the total accumulated amount is won, otherwise, a participation prize equal to 20% of the bet is won.\n            ",

The game provides an entertaining and immersive gaming experience for football fans and others alike.\n\nSix Reels and 6,784 Ways to Win\n\nThe game screen is divided into two halves, each corresponding to a team. Each team has three reels and five rows, totaling six reels. The game offers 6,784 ways to win, with a gameplay system that pays both from left to right and vice versa, double wild reels, free spins, and a final bonus.\n\nRealistic Graphics and Gameplay\n\nEspresso Games is known for its meticulous graphics, and #90 Spins is no exception. The game starts with a walk down the locker room corridor, leading to a green field where players choose their favorite team and make a bet on the result. The graphics are realistic, making #90 Spins look more like a PlayStation game than a slot machine.\n\nFootball-themed Symbols and Betting Options\n\nSymbols on the reels include regular playing cards from 10 to Ace and thematic symbols related to football, including a football shoe, captain's armband, goalkeeper's glove saving the ball, the cup, and the corner flag. Two wild symbols represented by players from opposing teams can cover the entire reel on which they appear. Players can make a prediction on the result and bet on which half the winning spins will concentrate.\n\nPersonal Accumulator and Participation Prize\n\nPlayers who choose a team at the start of the game must maintain that choice for 90 spins. Each regular spin increases the timer by one minute and adds 10% of the bet to the personal accumulator. At the end of the 90 spins, the total accumulated amount is won; otherwise, a participation prize equal to 20% of the bet is awarded.\n\n        \n            ",

Could a slot game be missing to celebrate this event? Espresso Games, an Italian software house, has thought of it and created a product that celebrates the national sport of Italy!\n\nSince 2002, Espresso Games has distinguished itself for its extremely meticulous graphics and attention to detail, which we can also admire in #90 Spins. At the start of the game, we find ourselves walking down the locker room corridor as if we were players ourselves, until we arrive on the green field, where we will be asked to choose our favorite team and make our first bet on the result. The graphics are very realistic, and #90 Spins looks more like a PlayStation game than a slot machine!\n\nRecommended especially for football fans, but also incredibly entertaining for everyone else! \n\nMain features of the slot machine: When we open #90 Spins, we are faced with a rather unusual game screen: the screen is divided into two halves, each corresponding to a team. Each \"team\" has three reels and five rows, for a total of six reels. At the beginning of the game, we must make a prediction on the result, betting on which half the winning spins will concentrate. #90 Spins offers 6,784 ways to win, a gameplay system that pays both from left to right and vice versa, double wild reels, free spins, and a final bonus to convince even the most skeptical!\n\n#90 Spins opens with a predefined coin bet, which can be changed using the \"COIN VALUE\" and \"STEP\" buttons. Symbols and special features of #90 Spins: The symbols that alternate on the reels of #90 Spins are divided into regular and special. We find both the so-called \"reals\", the numbers and letters that correspond to playing cards from 10 to Ace, as well as thematic symbols obviously related to the world of football, including a football shoe, a captain's armband, a goalkeeper's glove saving the ball, the cup, and the corner flag.\n\nThere are two wild symbols, represented by players of two opposing teams, which can appear on the third and fourth reels and cover the entire reel on which they appear. There is also a Free Spins symbol, which can only be found on the first and sixth reels, and allows access to a variable number of free spins. The choice of the team at the start of the game must be maintained for 90 minutes (spins): each regular spin increases the timer by one minute and adds 10% of the bet to the personal accumulator. At the end of the 90 spins, the total accumulated amount is won, otherwise, a participation prize equal to 20% of the bet is won.\n            ",

Could a slot game be missing to celebrate this event? Espresso Games, an Italian software house, has thought of it and created a product that celebrates the national sport of Italy!\n\nSince 2002, Espresso Games has distinguished itself for its extremely meticulous graphics and attention to detail, which we can also admire in #90 Spins. At the start of the game, we find ourselves walking down the locker room corridor as if we were players ourselves, until we arrive on the green field, where we will be asked to choose our favorite team and make our first bet on the result. The graphics are very realistic, and #90 Spins looks more like a PlayStation game than a slot machine!\n\nRecommended especially for football fans, but also incredibly entertaining for everyone else! \n\nMain features of the slot machine: When we open #90 Spins, we are faced with a rather unusual game screen: the screen is divided into two halves, each corresponding to a team. Each \"team\" has three reels and five rows, for a total of six reels. At the beginning of the game, we must make a prediction on the result, betting on which half the winning spins will concentrate. #90 Spins offers 6,784 ways to win, a gameplay system that pays both from left to right and vice versa, double wild reels, free spins, and a final bonus to convince even the most skeptical!\n\n#90 Spins opens with a predefined coin bet, which can be changed using the \"COIN VALUE\" and \"STEP\" buttons. Symbols and special features of #90 Spins: The symbols that alternate on the reels of #90 Spins are divided into regular and special. We find both the so-called \"reals\", the numbers and letters that correspond to playing cards from 10 to Ace, as well as thematic symbols obviously related to the world of football, including a football shoe, a captain's armband, a goalkeeper's glove saving the ball, the cup, and the corner flag.\n\nThere are two wild symbols, represented by players of two opposing teams, which can appear on the third and fourth reels and cover the entire reel on which they appear. There is also a Free Spins symbol, which can only be found on the first and sixth reels, and allows access to a variable number of free spins. The choice of the team at the start of the game must be maintained for 90 minutes (spins): each regular spin increases the timer by one minute and adds 10% of the bet to the personal accumulator. At the end of the 90 spins, the total accumulated amount is won, otherwise, a participation prize equal to 20% of the bet is won.\n            ",
