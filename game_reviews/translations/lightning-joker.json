With just 3 reels and 5 paylines, it may seem basic at first, but don't be fooled - this game holds some exciting surprises. With a 10x multiplier and the potential to increase your winnings exponentially, Lightning Joker is not to be underestimated. And let's not forget those jokers - land three and you could be looking at a win of 10,000 times your bet. With an RTP of 96.3%, it's certainly one of the best online gambling titles around.\n\nGraphics and Symbols \nWhile the fruit theme is a common one for slot games, Lightning Joker manages to keep it fresh with its simple yet elegant design. As well as the classic cherries, grapes, watermelons, lemons, and bell symbols, you'll also see lucky sevens and stars. The lightning bolt symbol is particularly important, acting as a substitute for all other symbols to help create winning combinations. Keep an eye out for the three bonus features too - Respins, random multipliers, and the Mystery Win function.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Lightning Joker \nLightning Joker may be a simple game, but its three bonus features add a level of excitement and variation. If you're looking for a straightforward and classic slot game with potential for big wins, then this game is definitely worth a try. However, if you're into more elaborate and modern video slots, then perhaps this is not the game for you.

Despite its retro touch, it manages to present some really interesting features. For example, its multiplier reaches up to 10x and allows the player to exponentially increase their winnings. But that's not the only surprise we want to talk about: we also find its Wilds that guarantee 10,000 times your bet value if they appear 3 times. Not bad at all, especially considering its RTP of 96.3%, which is standard for the best online gambling titles.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nThe inspiration is well-known, as we talk about the fruit theme, which is a bit of a leitmotif for slot machines. If a provider has not offered at least one, they cannot really say that they work closely with this gaming sector.\n\nLightning Joker wanted to keep a very simple but elegant design that is also quite modern. There are no surprises in terms of symbols and you will find yourself playing with classic cherries, grapes, watermelons, lemons, and a golden bell. Add the lucky 7s, which can never be missed, and the Stars. The lucky symbol is the Lightning that can replace all symbols from which to create your win.\n\nLet's mention its 3 bonus features, which manifest with Respins, random multipliers, and the Mystery Win feature. The latter is activated with 2 Joker symbols that win a mysterious prize with a multiplier that starts from 2x to 10,000x. However, the maximum is given by the placement of 3 Wilds on the same payline, which allows you to unlock from a minimum of 1,000x to 10,000 times the bet.\n\nThere is also the Rapid Spin function, which starts when 2 reels are filled with the same symbol, or with Wild symbols. The aim is to achieve a full screen and do the full with the same symbol. Should this little dream come true, it will activate another bonus game, which will attribute a random multiplier to the winnings ranging from 2x to 10x.\n\nFinally, there is the Mystery Win feature. This is played when you land at least 2 Joker symbols. You can win a Mystery Win prize up to 10,000 times your total bet!\n\nFinal thoughts on the Lightning Joker slot\nLightning Joker may or may not appeal to you, but it is certainly a simple game that has a basic mission: to propose a new variant on the fruit theme. There are 3 bonus features that are interesting and certainly make the entire game and its gameplay more lively and versatile.\n\nIt's easy to say that if you are interested in this type of simplicity in slot machines and are not looking for special animations or a gaming rich in surprises, this is an interesting title to try. But if you love more modern video slots, this will not be Yggdrasil Gaming's most suitable proposal for you!\n            ",

Despite its retro touch, it manages to present some really interesting features. For example, its multiplier reaches up to 10x and allows the player to exponentially increase their winnings. But that's not the only surprise we want to talk about: we also find its Wilds that guarantee 10,000 times your bet value if they appear 3 times. Not bad at all, especially considering its RTP of 96.3%, which is standard for the best online gambling titles.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nThe inspiration is well-known, as we talk about the fruit theme, which is a bit of a leitmotif for slot machines. If a provider has not offered at least one, they cannot really say that they work closely with this gaming sector.\n\nLightning Joker wanted to keep a very simple but elegant design that is also quite modern. There are no surprises in terms of symbols and you will find yourself playing with classic cherries, grapes, watermelons, lemons, and a golden bell. Add the lucky 7s, which can never be missed, and the Stars. The lucky symbol is the Lightning that can replace all symbols from which to create your win.\n\nLet's mention its 3 bonus features, which manifest with Respins, random multipliers, and the Mystery Win feature. The latter is activated with 2 Joker symbols that win a mysterious prize with a multiplier that starts from 2x to 10,000x. However, the maximum is given by the placement of 3 Wilds on the same payline, which allows you to unlock from a minimum of 1,000x to 10,000 times the bet.\n\nThere is also the Rapid Spin function, which starts when 2 reels are filled with the same symbol, or with Wild symbols. The aim is to achieve a full screen and do the full with the same symbol. Should this little dream come true, it will activate another bonus game, which will attribute a random multiplier to the winnings ranging from 2x to 10x.\n\nFinally, there is the Mystery Win feature. This is played when you land at least 2 Joker symbols. You can win a Mystery Win prize up to 10,000 times your total bet!\n\nFinal thoughts on the Lightning Joker slot\nLightning Joker may or may not appeal to you, but it is certainly a simple game that has a basic mission: to propose a new variant on the fruit theme. There are 3 bonus features that are interesting and certainly make the entire game and its gameplay more lively and versatile.\n\nIt's easy to say that if you are interested in this type of simplicity in slot machines and are not looking for special animations or a gaming rich in surprises, this is an interesting title to try. But if you love more modern video slots, this will not be Yggdrasil Gaming's most suitable proposal for you!\n            ",

This is played when you land at least 2 Joker symbols. You can win a Mystery Win prize up to 10,000 times your total bet!\n\nFinal thoughts on the Lightning Joker slot\nLightning Joker may or may not appeal to you, but it is certainly a simple game that has a basic mission: to propose a new variant on the fruit theme.
