Ne vale la pena, no?\nSimboli regolari, Wild e Scatter in Book of Atem\nIn questa slot i simboli si dividono in tematici e non tematici, e in regolari e speciali.\nTra i simboli regolari non tematici, come spesso accade, troviamo i numeri e le lettere che si riferiscono alle carte da gioco dal 10 all’Asso, riprodotti in maniera coerente con il resto della grafica.\nI simboli tematici regolari sono invece rappresentati da una ninfea che galleggia in un lago, un cobra e un immancabile faraone, che tra tutti i simboli è quello che paga di più, offrendo una vincita pari a 500 volte la puntata nel caso di allineamento su tutti i cinque rulli.\nIn Book of Atem il simbolo chiave è proprio il libro di Atem, che svolge la doppia funzione di Wild e Scatter: come Wild funge da jolly sostituendo gli altri simboli, mentre come Scatter permette di accedere al gioco Bonus Free Spins.\nFree Spins e simboli espandibili\nQuando il Libro di Atem atterra per 3, 4 o 5 volte sui rulli in un singolo giro, si ottiene un pagamento pari a 2, 20 o 200 volte la puntata iniziale, ma non solo, si accederà anche alla funzione Free Spins, cominciando con 10 giri gratuiti.\nPrima dell’inizio dei Free Spins uno tra i simboli standard verrà selezionato casualmente e avrà il ruolo di simbolo espandibile: ogni volta che comparirà sui rulli infatti si espanderà fino a coprirli tutti, aumentando così le possibilità di vincita.\nSe durante i giri gratuiti si avrà nuovamente una combinazione di tre simboli che rappresentano il Libro di Atem si otterranno altri 10 Free Spins e questo può accadere virtualmente un numero illimitato di volte!\n",

However, we truly believe that it has all the characteristics to become one of your favorite slots: a simple game with a high potential for winnings and an engaging theme that most players choose for casual and fun gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are polished, and what impressed us the most is that unlike most Egyptian-themed slots, it does not rely on warm colors such as purple and copper. Instead, it has a calming aquamarine backdrop that creates a relaxing gaming experience.\n\nThe structure of Book of Atem is straightforward: five reels, ten paylines, and a betting range from €0.10 up to €25. The Return to Player rate is excellent, at 96.45%, and the maximum payout for this slot machine is 5,000 times the initial bet, a cash value of €125,000! Definitely worth a shot, don't you think?\n\nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters in Book of Atem\n\nThe symbols in this slot are divided into thematic and non-thematic symbols, regular and special symbols. Among the non-thematic regular symbols are the numbers and letters representing playing cards from ten to Ace, consistent with the overall graphics.\n\nThe regular thematic symbols are a lotus floating on a lake, a cobra, and of course, a pharaoh, which is the highest-paying symbol, offering a win of 500 times the bet for a line-up of five symbols.\n\nThe key symbol in Book of Atem is, of course, the book of Atem, which acts as both Wild and Scatter. As a Wild, it substitutes for other symbols, while, as a Scatter, it triggers the Bonus Free Spins.\n\nFree Spins and Expanding symbols\n\nWhen the Book of Atem lands three, four, or five times on the reels in a single spin, you get a payout of 2, 20, or 200 times the initial bet. Furthermore, you trigger the Free Spins feature, starting with ten free spins.\n\nBefore the start of Free Spins, one of the standard symbols is randomly selected to act as the expanding symbol. Whenever it appears on the reels, it expands to cover the entire reel, significantly increasing the chance of a win.\n\nIf during the Free Spins, three Book of Atem symbols again appear on the reels, you'll get another ten Free Spins, and this can happen an unlimited number of times!\n            ",

However, we truly believe that it has all the characteristics to become one of your favorite slots: a simple game with a high potential for winnings and an engaging theme that most players choose for casual and fun gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are polished, and what impressed us the most is that unlike most Egyptian-themed slots, it does not rely on warm colors such as purple and copper. Instead, it has a calming aquamarine backdrop that creates a relaxing gaming experience.\n\nThe structure of Book of Atem is straightforward: five reels, ten paylines, and a betting range from €0.10 up to €25. The Return to Player rate is excellent, at 96.45%, and the maximum payout for this slot machine is 5,000 times the initial bet, a cash value of €125,000! Definitely worth a shot, don't you think?\n\nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters in Book of Atem\n\nThe symbols in this slot are divided into thematic and non-thematic symbols, regular and special symbols. Among the non-thematic regular symbols are the numbers and letters representing playing cards from ten to Ace, consistent with the overall graphics.\n\nThe regular thematic symbols are a lotus floating on a lake, a cobra, and of course, a pharaoh, which is the highest-paying symbol, offering a win of 500 times the bet for a line-up of five symbols.\n\nThe key symbol in Book of Atem is, of course, the book of Atem, which acts as both Wild and Scatter. As a Wild, it substitutes for other symbols, while, as a Scatter, it triggers the Bonus Free Spins.\n\nFree Spins and Expanding symbols\n\nWhen the Book of Atem lands three, four, or five times on the reels in a single spin, you get a payout of 2, 20, or 200 times the initial bet. Furthermore, you trigger the Free Spins feature, starting with ten free spins.\n\nBefore the start of Free Spins, one of the standard symbols is randomly selected to act as the expanding symbol. Whenever it appears on the reels, it expands to cover the entire reel, significantly increasing the chance of a win.\n\nIf during the Free Spins, three Book of Atem symbols again appear on the reels, you'll get another ten Free Spins, and this can happen an unlimited number of times!\n            ",
