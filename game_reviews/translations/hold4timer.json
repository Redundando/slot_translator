With a 3×3 grid and 6 paylines, colorful reels full of vintage-style icons, and sound effects reminiscent of a real slot machine, players will have a retro gaming experience while taking advantage of modern features such as the Super Stake and Gamble Feature. The return to player is 95.01%, with medium to low volatility and a maximum win of €160,000 on a single spin.\n\nGame Features and Graphics\n\nWith a colorful and classic graphics display, the slot features basic symbols depicting fruit (lemon, watermelon, oranges, pears), standard symbols such as 7 and Golden Crowns, and a Wild symbol (depicting the word itself) capable of triggering the Super Stake feature. Winning combinations can also be created during the base game when at least 3 identical symbols land on the same payline. For example, with 3 lemons, oranges, or pears, you will get 8x your bet, while with 3 raspberries, melons, 7s, or Crowns, the multiplier goes up to 16x. After each winning combination, the Gamble option is launched so you can try to double the prize.\n\nThanks to optimized graphics, the game is available for both fixed devices and all types of smartphones and tablets.\n\nSpecial Features of the Hold4Timer Slot\n\nWithout a doubt, the most interesting symbol is the Wild, which substitutes for any other icon and increases the chance of winning. Despite being a classic game, there are some special features that should not be missed. Let's see them together:\n\nSuper Stake - When this feature is activated, Wild symbols are added to the reels to replace all other symbols and increase the chances of winning even more.\n\nGamble Feature - You can decide whether or not to use the Betting option after every winning combination. You must choose \"heads\" or \"tails\". If your choice is correct, you can double your winnings.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Hold4Timer Slot\n\nHold4Timer is ideal for lovers of past slots as it transports you back in time through retro sounds and graphics, but with the addition of a touch of modernity thanks to the special features Super Stake and Gamble Feature, which make your bets more attractive and your winnings even higher.
