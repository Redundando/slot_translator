Infatti se in altre slot si possono trovare simboli classici quali ciliegie, campane o ancora quelli delle carte (A, K, Q, J e 10) nella slot Day of the Dead questi sono sostituiti da mazzi di fiori, il tipico pane dei morti, la bevanda atole e l’incenso Copale.\nPer quanto riguarda le diverse combinazioni, queste sono accompagnate da vivaci e simpatiche animazioni di scheletri ballerini e mariachi.\nLa musica di Day of the Dead non disturba quest’armonia di dettagli in quanto predominano le trombe delle tipiche sonorità messicane.

Questo permette di mostrare 19 simboli a ogni giocata e di proporre molte più linee di vincita, arrivando addirittura a 720.\nParlando di simboli speciali, ne troviamo tre in particolare che sono degni di interesse: lo Scatter paga in qualsiasi posizione si trovi purché siano presenti almeno tre simboli in tutta la schermata e trovarne cinque permette di ottenere 50 volte la nostra puntata.

During Día de los muertos, the deceased are remembered in a picturesque way, with splendid colors of flowers, food offered generously to loved ones who have passed away, and painted faces like skulls to exorcise death. This interest in this ancient Mexican tradition has also come to the world of slots with Day of the Dead from IGT.\n\nLet's analyze the various aspects of the slot, starting from the purely graphic and sound component and then moving on to its more technical parts.\n\nDay of the Dead - Graphics\nThe graphic department of the Day of the Dead slot is finely crafted down to the smallest detail. The background of the slot recalls the altars of Día de los muertos with lit candles and an abundance of warm colors of flowers and fruits. The attention to detail is particularly found in the game board, where the various symbols relate directly to death-related celebrations, such as the WILD symbol with colorful coffins. In fact, while other slots may feature classic symbols such as cherries, bells, or even card symbols (A, K, Q, J, and 10), in the Day of the Dead slot, they are replaced by flower bouquets, the typical bread of the dead, the atole drink, and the Copal incense. \n\nAs for the various combinations, these are accompanied by lively and humorous animations of dancing skeletons and mariachis. The Day of the Dead music does not disrupt this harmony of details as the typical Mexican trumpet sounds dominate. The same can be said for the sounds, which are fun and on-theme with the slot.\n\nBut now let's move on to the more technical part of this Day of the Dead.\n\nDay of the Dead - Gameplay Mechanics\nJust one look at this slot is enough to understand that the IGT's Day of the Dead is a game different from usual: contrary to the typical 5*3 game board that shows fifteen symbols for each bet along the twenty paylines, we have a mechanism of 5*(3-4-5-4-3).\n\nThe number of symbols displayed on each reel actually increases toward the center of the slot and then decreases again toward the end of the screen.

We also find a Wild symbol that can replace all the others (except for the special ones), and a Bonus that allows access to the free spins mode.\n\nSlots Similar to Day of the Dead\nAlthough the theme is not among the most commonly used in the world, it is still possible to find other slots that propose Día de los Muertos as a central subject.

This ancient Mexican tradition has also made its way into the world of slots with IGT's \"Day of the Dead.\" In this review, we will analyze the various components of the slot, starting from its graphics and sound, and moving on to its more technical aspects.\n\nDay of the Dead - Graphics\nThe graphics of the \"Day of the Dead\" slot are meticulously detailed. The background of the slot is reminiscent of the altars of the \"Día de los muertos,\" with lit candles and an abundance of warm colors from the petals of the flowers and fruit. The attention to detail is especially evident in the game grid, where the various symbols are related to the death celebration, as seen in the WILD symbol with its colorful coffins. Unlike other slots where classic symbols such as cherries, bells, or playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J, and 10) can be found, in \"Day of the Dead,\" they are replaced by flower arrangements, typical bread for the dead, atole drink, and Copal incense. The different combinations are accompanied by lively and friendly animations of dancing skeletons and mariachi. The music of the \"Day of the Dead\" slot perfectly complements the theme, with typical Mexican trumpets accompanied by cheerful and thematic sounds.\n\nDay of the Dead - Game Mechanics\nJust one look at this slot and it's clear that the \"Day of the Dead\" by IGT is not your average game: instead of the typical 5x3 grid that displays fifteen symbols for each game along twenty paylines, we have a mechanism of 5x(3-4-5-4-3). The number of symbols on each reel increases as it moves toward the center of the slot, then decreases again towards the end of the screen. This allows for 19 symbols to be shown on each play and provides up to 720 paylines. Regarding special symbols, there are three in particular that deserve attention: the Scatter pays in any position as long as at least three symbols are present on the screen and finding five of them rewards 50 times our bet. We also find a Wild symbol that can replace all others (except the special ones) and the Bonus that gives access to the mode with free spins.\n\nSimilar Slots to Day of the Dead\nAlthough the theme is not among the most commonly used in the world, it is possible to find other slots that propose \"Día de los Muertos\" as their central argument. An example is \"Dia de Los Muertos\" by Endorphina, which shows a very detailed and particular style.\n\nFAQs - Day of the Dead\nWhere can I play \"Day of the Dead\" for free?\nIf you want to try \"Day of the Dead\" for free before betting real money, you've come to the right place! Here on SlotJava, you can have fun playing with this and other slots without downloading any software or registering on the site.\n\nCan I play \"Day of the Dead\" with real money?\nYes, simply register at an online casino such as Snai, NetBet, EuroBet, FantasyTeam, and many others. It is crucial to only orient oneself towards casinos with a license issued by the Agency for Monopolies and Customs, the only ones that can guarantee a 100% level of security. You can consult our guides to choose between the various casinos right for you and discover all active bonuses and promotions.\n\nCan I get no deposit bonuses and free spins to play \"Day of the Dead\"?\nThe strength of all online slots is precisely the ability to take advantage of bonuses and promotions without necessarily having to make a deposit.

During Día de los muertos, the deceased are remembered in a picturesque way, with splendid colors of flowers, food offered generously to loved ones who have passed away, and painted faces like skulls to exorcise death. This interest in this ancient Mexican tradition has also come to the world of slots with Day of the Dead from IGT.\n\nLet's analyze the various aspects of the slot, starting from the purely graphic and sound component and then moving on to its more technical parts.\n\nDay of the Dead - Graphics\nThe graphic department of the Day of the Dead slot is finely crafted down to the smallest detail. The background of the slot recalls the altars of Día de los muertos with lit candles and an abundance of warm colors of flowers and fruits. The attention to detail is particularly found in the game board, where the various symbols relate directly to death-related celebrations, such as the WILD symbol with colorful coffins. In fact, while other slots may feature classic symbols such as cherries, bells, or even card symbols (A, K, Q, J, and 10), in the Day of the Dead slot, they are replaced by flower bouquets, the typical bread of the dead, the atole drink, and the Copal incense. \n\nAs for the various combinations, these are accompanied by lively and humorous animations of dancing skeletons and mariachis. The Day of the Dead music does not disrupt this harmony of details as the typical Mexican trumpet sounds dominate. The same can be said for the sounds, which are fun and on-theme with the slot.\n\nBut now let's move on to the more technical part of this Day of the Dead.\n\nDay of the Dead - Gameplay Mechanics\nJust one look at this slot is enough to understand that the IGT's Day of the Dead is a game different from usual: contrary to the typical 5*3 game board that shows fifteen symbols for each bet along the twenty paylines, we have a mechanism of 5*(3-4-5-4-3).\n\nThe number of symbols displayed on each reel actually increases toward the center of the slot and then decreases again toward the end of the screen. This allows showing 19 symbols for each bet and proposing many more paylines, even up to 720. \n\nSpeaking of special symbols, we find three in particular that are worthy of interest: the Scatter pays in any position as long as at least three symbols are present on the entire screen, and finding five allows you to get 50 times your bet. We also find a Wild symbol that can replace all the others (except for the special ones), and a Bonus that allows access to the free spins mode.\n\nSlots Similar to Day of the Dead\nAlthough the theme is not among the most commonly used in the world, it is still possible to find other slots that propose Día de los Muertos as a central subject. Endorphina's Dia de Los Muertos, for example, shows a very detailed and detailed style.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions - Day of the Dead \nWhere can I play Day of the Dead for free?\n\nIf you want to try Day of the Dead slot for free before betting real money, you're in the right place! Here on SlotJava, you have the opportunity to have fun playing with this and many other slots without having to download any software or even register on the website.\n\nCan I play Day of the Dead with real money?\n\nYes, you just need to register at an online casino such as Snai, NetBet, EuroBet, FantasyTeam, and many others. It is crucial to only choose casinos with a license issued by the Monopoly and Customs Agency, the only ones that can guarantee 100% safety. You can consult our guides to choose the right casino for you and discover all the active bonuses and promotions.\n\nCan I get no deposit bonuses and free spins to play Day of the Dead?\n\nThe strength of all online slots is precisely the ability to take advantage of bonuses and promotions without having to make a deposit. If you want to know what bonuses and free spins are offered, take a look at our site. Just to name a few, NetBet offers 50 free spins as a no deposit bonus, while Snai's offer is for €10.\n\nHow do I play Day of the Dead?\n\nNothing could be simpler, just select the amount of the bet and start spinning the reels. You win with combinations of identical symbols on one or more paylines. Scatter, Wild, and special symbols will greatly increase the frequency and scope of winnings.\n\nWhat is the software provider for Day of the Dead?\n\nDay of the Dead is a slot from IGT, a software house well known to slot machine enthusiasts for its high-quality products and constant attention to new technologies, with games always up to date. Among the many high-level titles produced by IGT, we cannot forget The Big Easy, Candy Bars, Da Vinci Diamond, all available for free on SlotJava.

There are three of them, each of which can help you to get your hands on some seriously big payouts.</p>\n\n<p>First up, we have the Scatter symbol. If you manage to land three or more of these symbols anywhere on the reels, you'll be in for a treat, as the Scatter pays out regardless of position. And let's be honest, who doesn't like a payout? (Except maybe the IRS.)</p>\n\n<p>Next, we have the Wild symbol. This symbol is like the joker in a deck of cards, as it can replace any other symbol except the special ones. So if you're one symbol short of a winning combination, the Wild could be just what you need to complete it. Plus, if you're feeling particularly saucy, you can always pretend the Wild is your spirit animal, and roar every time it appears on the reels.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we have the Bonus symbol. This little beauty is the key to unlocking free spin mode. And who doesn't like free spins? (Again, except maybe the IRS.) Simply land enough Bonus symbols on the reels, and you'll be whisked away to a special free spin mode, where you'll have more chances to win without having to spend any extra money.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, these three symbols are what make Day of the Dead truly special. Without them, it would just be another run-of-the-mill slot game with skulls and skeletons. But thanks to these special symbols, every spin is a thrill, and every win is just a little bit sweeter. So why not give it a shot? Who knows, you may just end up with a big payout and a smile on your face! (But maybe not on the same day as the IRS.)</p>"

The reel mechanism features 5*(3-4-5-4-3) symbols, which increases towards the centre and decreases towards the end of the screen. This offers 19 symbols for each bet and a maximum of 720 paylines. The payoff of numerous paylines is generally more frequent minor wins rather than major ones. Winning combinations are based on identical symbols on one or more paylines, scatters, wilds, and special symbols.\n\nScatter, Wild, and Bonus Symbols\n\nDay of the Dead features three unique and beneficial symbols. Scatters pay out in any position with at least three symbols, and landing five grants players 50 times their bet. This slot's wild symbol can replace all other symbols (except for special ones), and the bonus symbol can access the free spins mode.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nIGT's Day of the Dead reels players in with its finely detailed graphics and on-theme sound effects. The warm colors of flowers and food are representative of Mexican altars, which are prevalent throughout the Día de los Muertos celebration. Symbols, which players can't find in other slots, are related to death-related celebrations, such as the WILD coffin. Lively animations from dancing skeletons and mariachis accompany winning combinations, and the game sounds consist of fun and on-topic audio effects with the typical Mexican trumpet. \n\nMexican Inspiration\n\nThe Day of the Dead is a Mexican-inspired game that is based on the famous Día de los muertos celebration, a time when the deceased are remembered and celebrated. The celebration focuses on the presentation of the loved ones with warm colors, flowers, and painted faces like skulls to quell death. IGT's attention to detail really shines when playing Day of the Dead, as the game board and the symbols directly reflect the celebration's custom symbols.\n\nPaylines\n\nDay of the Dead offers a unique approach to paylines with 720 possible combinations. While players will experience more frequent minor wins, they have the possibility of hitting major paylines less frequently due to the overall mechanism of the slot. \n\nSimilar Slots\n\nWhile the theme of Dia de Los Muertos may not be the most commonly used in the world of online slots, one can find other slots with it as the central subject, such as Endorphina's Dia de Los Muertos. This slot also shows a very detailed style.\n\nFree Play Options\n\nSlotJava offers players the ability to play Day of the Dead and many other slots without having to download anything or register on a website. Players can try out Day of the Dead for free on SlotJava before betting real money. Bonuses and promotions like no deposit bonuses and free spins without having to make a deposit can make online slots more available to everyone, including Day of the Dead. NetBet provides a no-deposit bonus of 50 free spins, while Snai offers  €10.\n\nLicensed Casinos\n\nSeveral online casinos, such as Snai, NetBet, EuroBet, and FantasyTeam offer Day of the Dead for real money.

Players can consult our guides to choose the right casino for them and to discover all the available bonuses and promotions.\n\n        \n            ",

During Día de los muertos, the deceased are remembered in a picturesque way, with splendid colors of flowers, food offered generously to loved ones who have passed away, and painted faces like skulls to exorcise death. This interest in this ancient Mexican tradition has also come to the world of slots with Day of the Dead from IGT.\n\nLet's analyze the various aspects of the slot, starting from the purely graphic and sound component and then moving on to its more technical parts.\n\nDay of the Dead - Graphics\nThe graphic department of the Day of the Dead slot is finely crafted down to the smallest detail. The background of the slot recalls the altars of Día de los muertos with lit candles and an abundance of warm colors of flowers and fruits. The attention to detail is particularly found in the game board, where the various symbols relate directly to death-related celebrations, such as the WILD symbol with colorful coffins. In fact, while other slots may feature classic symbols such as cherries, bells, or even card symbols (A, K, Q, J, and 10), in the Day of the Dead slot, they are replaced by flower bouquets, the typical bread of the dead, the atole drink, and the Copal incense. \n\nAs for the various combinations, these are accompanied by lively and humorous animations of dancing skeletons and mariachis. The Day of the Dead music does not disrupt this harmony of details as the typical Mexican trumpet sounds dominate. The same can be said for the sounds, which are fun and on-theme with the slot.\n\nBut now let's move on to the more technical part of this Day of the Dead.\n\nDay of the Dead - Gameplay Mechanics\nJust one look at this slot is enough to understand that the IGT's Day of the Dead is a game different from usual: contrary to the typical 5*3 game board that shows fifteen symbols for each bet along the twenty paylines, we have a mechanism of 5*(3-4-5-4-3).\n\nThe number of symbols displayed on each reel actually increases toward the center of the slot and then decreases again toward the end of the screen. This allows showing 19 symbols for each bet and proposing many more paylines, even up to 720. \n\nSpeaking of special symbols, we find three in particular that are worthy of interest: the Scatter pays in any position as long as at least three symbols are present on the entire screen, and finding five allows you to get 50 times your bet. We also find a Wild symbol that can replace all the others (except for the special ones), and a Bonus that allows access to the free spins mode.\n\nSlots Similar to Day of the Dead\nAlthough the theme is not among the most commonly used in the world, it is still possible to find other slots that propose Día de los Muertos as a central subject. Endorphina's Dia de Los Muertos, for example, shows a very detailed and detailed style.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions - Day of the Dead \nWhere can I play Day of the Dead for free?\n\nIf you want to try Day of the Dead slot for free before betting real money, you're in the right place!

During Día de los muertos, the deceased are remembered in a picturesque way, with splendid colors of flowers, food offered generously to loved ones who have passed away, and painted faces like skulls to exorcise death. This interest in this ancient Mexican tradition has also come to the world of slots with Day of the Dead from IGT.\n\nLet's analyze the various aspects of the slot, starting from the purely graphic and sound component and then moving on to its more technical parts.\n\nDay of the Dead - Graphics\nThe graphic department of the Day of the Dead slot is finely crafted down to the smallest detail. The background of the slot recalls the altars of Día de los muertos with lit candles and an abundance of warm colors of flowers and fruits. The attention to detail is particularly found in the game board, where the various symbols relate directly to death-related celebrations, such as the WILD symbol with colorful coffins. In fact, while other slots may feature classic symbols such as cherries, bells, or even card symbols (A, K, Q, J, and 10), in the Day of the Dead slot, they are replaced by flower bouquets, the typical bread of the dead, the atole drink, and the Copal incense. \n\nAs for the various combinations, these are accompanied by lively and humorous animations of dancing skeletons and mariachis. The Day of the Dead music does not disrupt this harmony of details as the typical Mexican trumpet sounds dominate. The same can be said for the sounds, which are fun and on-theme with the slot.\n\nBut now let's move on to the more technical part of this Day of the Dead.\n\nDay of the Dead - Gameplay Mechanics\nJust one look at this slot is enough to understand that the IGT's Day of the Dead is a game different from usual: contrary to the typical 5*3 game board that shows fifteen symbols for each bet along the twenty paylines, we have a mechanism of 5*(3-4-5-4-3).\n\nThe number of symbols displayed on each reel actually increases toward the center of the slot and then decreases again toward the end of the screen. This allows showing 19 symbols for each bet and proposing many more paylines, even up to 720. \n\nSpeaking of special symbols, we find three in particular that are worthy of interest: the Scatter pays in any position as long as at least three symbols are present on the entire screen, and finding five allows you to get 50 times your bet. We also find a Wild symbol that can replace all the others (except for the special ones), and a Bonus that allows access to the free spins mode.\n\nSlots Similar to Day of the Dead\nAlthough the theme is not among the most commonly used in the world, it is still possible to find other slots that propose Día de los Muertos as a central subject. Endorphina's Dia de Los Muertos, for example, shows a very detailed and detailed style.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions - Day of the Dead \nWhere can I play Day of the Dead for free?\n\nIf you want to try Day of the Dead slot for free before betting real money, you're in the right place! Here on SlotJava, you have the opportunity to have fun playing with this and many other slots without having to download any software or even register on the website.\n\nCan I play Day of the Dead with real money?\n\nYes, you just need to register at an online casino such as Snai, NetBet, EuroBet, FantasyTeam, and many others.
