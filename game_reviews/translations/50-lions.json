Questa slot è una vecchia conoscenza del mondo delle sale giochi terrestri; ancora oggi viene proposta con un alto indice di gradimento da parte degli utenti, nelle “sale virtuali” dei casinò online aams. Il tema sui cui si concentra il gioco è la savana e i suoi abitanti; tutti i simboli presenti infatti, raffigurano animali, persone o paesaggi del fantastico e sconfinato continente Africano. Le regole di gioco sono tra le più comuni; si vince allineando almeno tre simboli uguali partendo da sinistra verso destra e, per incrementare il proprio montepremi, la slot offre la possibilità di sfruttare il bonus dato dai free spin insieme alla modalità Gamble.\nGrafica della slot machine\nLa slot 50 Lions è un titolo longevo realizzato nei primi anni duemila. La sua meccanica di gioco e le sue animazioni sono le stesse di sempre; se da una parte è evidente il peso degli anni, possiamo comunque dire che si tratta di un prodotto graficamente al passo con i tempi, funzionale e di qualità. Come detto i simboli fanno riferimento alla cultura africana, tra tutti questi spicca il più rappresentativo dell’intero continente ovvero il Leone, il Re della savana, che dà il nome alla slot ed è anche il simbolo più remunerativo del gioco. Oltre al Leone troviamo: la Zebra, la Giraffa, gli Indigeni, l’albero di Acacia, le lettere J, Q, K e A ed i numeri 9 e 10. Il simbolo Wild è raffigurato da un Diamante, mentre lo Scatter è rappresentato da un fiore di Protea.\nLe funzioni e i bonus della slot\nQuesta slot machine permette di giocare fino a 50 linee di pagamento attive, suddivise su 5 rulli da 4 simboli ognuna. In 50 Lions come detto, avrai a tua disposizione la funzione Gamble con la quale potrai tentare di moltiplicare ognuna delle tue vincite cercando di indovinare il colore o il seme di una carta coperta. Il simbolo Wild della slot, il Diamante, compare esclusivamente sui rulli 2, 3, 4, e 5 e ti aiuterà a completare al meglio le combinazioni fungendo da jolly, sostituendosi agli altri simboli escluso lo Scatter. Per poter attivare la modalità free spin invece, avrai bisogno del simbolo con la rappresentazione del fiore di Protea. Questa immagina compare solo sui rulli 1, 2 e 3 e, con 3 di questi simboli in qualsiasi posizione, avrai 10 giri bonus da sfruttare. Di volta in volta, durante ognuno dei giri gratuiti, comparirà un nuovo simbolo Diamante extra Wild sui rulli 2, 3, 4, e 5 che ti permetterà di aumentare le probabilità di creare combinazioni vincenti multiple. Questa modalità bonus è sempre riattivabile grazie al simbolo Scatter fino ad un massimo di 5 volte consecutive.\nSlot simili a 50 Lions\nInsieme a 50 Lions altri titoli targati Aristocrat Technologies mantengono lo stesso standard di gioco. Ad esempio le due slot machine 50 Dragons e Miss Kitty hanno un layout dove sono presenti 50 linee di pagamento suddivise su 5 rulli di gioco, ognuno dei quali mostra 4 simboli; in più anche in queste due slot è possibile ottenere dei free spin come bonus (10 giri gratis per ognuna delle slot machine, sempre riattivabili) ed è presente inoltre la funzione Gamble con cui moltiplicare il valore della puntata appena vinta.\n",

This slot is a familiar face in the world of land-based gaming; even today it is offered with high ratings from users in the \"virtual rooms\" of AAMS online casinos. The game's theme is the savannah and its inhabitants; all the symbols, in fact, depict animals, people, or landscapes from the fantastic and expansive African continent. The game rules are among the most common; you win by aligning at least three identical symbols from left to right, and to increase your winnings, the slot offers the possibility of taking advantage of the bonus granted by free spins along with the Gamble mode.\nThe slot machine's graphics\nThe 50 Lions slot is an enduring title created in the early 2000s. Its gameplay mechanics and animations are the same as always; while the weight of its age is evident, we can still say that it is a graphically up-to-date, functional, and high-quality product. As mentioned, the symbols refer to African culture, with the most representative being the Lion, the King of the savannah, which gives the slot its name and is also the most lucrative symbol in the game. In addition to the Lion, we find: the Zebra, the Giraffe, the Natives, the Acacia tree, the letters J, Q, K, and A, and the numbers 9 and 10. The Wild symbol is represented by a Diamond, while the Scatter is represented by a Protea flower.\nThe functions and bonuses of the slot\nThis slot machine allows you to play up to 50 active pay lines, divided over 5 reels with 4 symbols each. In 50 Lions, as mentioned, you will have the Gamble function at your disposal, with which you can try to multiply each of your winnings by guessing the color or suit of a covered card. The Wild symbol of the slot, the Diamond, appears exclusively on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, and will help you complete combinations better by acting as a wildcard, replacing other symbols excluding the Scatter. To activate the free spin mode, instead, you will need the symbol with the representation of the Protea flower. This image appears only on reels 1, 2, and 3 and, with 3 of these symbols in any position, you will have 10 bonus spins to take advantage of. From time to time, during each of the free spins, a new extra Wild Diamond symbol will appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, allowing you to increase the chances of creating multiple winning combinations. This bonus mode is always reactivatable thanks to the Scatter symbol up to a maximum of 5 consecutive times.\nSimilar slots to 50 Lions\nTogether with 50 Lions, other titles branded by Aristocrat Technologies meet the same standard of play. For example, the two slot machines 50 Dragons and Miss Kitty have a layout where there are 50 pay lines divided over 5 reels of play, each of which shows 4 symbols. In addition, in both of these slots, it is possible to obtain free spins as a bonus (10 free spins for each of the slot machines, always reactivatable), and the Gamble function is also present, allowing to multiply the value of the stake just won.\n            ",

The Wild symbol is a Diamond, while the Scatter is represented by a Protea flower.\n\nBonus Features\n\n50 Lions offers a unique bonus feature called free spins mode where you can enjoy 10 free spins if you land 3 Scatter symbols, and the bonus mode is reactivatable up to 5 consecutive times. From time to time, during each of the free spins, a new extra Wild Diamond symbol will appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, allowing you to increase the chances of creating multiple winning combinations.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\n50 Lions is an enduring title created in the early 2000s. While the weight of its age is evident, we can still say that it is a graphically up-to-date, functional, and high-quality product. The symbols refer to African culture, and the animation is smooth and engaging, making it a visually enjoyable game experience.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nAlongside 50 Lions, other titles branded by Aristocrat Technologies meet the same standard of play, such as 50 Dragons and Miss Kitty, where there are 50 pay lines, 5 reels, and 4 symbols each in play. Both of these slots offer free spins as a bonus, always reactivatable. The Gamble function is also present in both these slots, allowing you to multiply the value of the stake just won.\n\n        \n            ",

The game graphics are high-quality, and it is a functional and up-to-date game.\n\nHow to win at 50 Lions\n\nTo win at 50 Lions, you need to align at least three identical symbols, starting from the left side and moving to the right. The lion symbol is the most valuable, while the diamond symbol is the Wild and helps to complete combinations by replacing other symbols. The Protea flower is the Scatter, which triggers the free spin mode with three symbols in any position of reels 1 to 3. In the 50 Lions slot game, it is possible to play up to 50 pay lines, and additional chances to win can be obtained through the Gamble mode.\n\nBonus mode and features\n\nThe bonus mode in the 50 Lions slot game is activated when three Scatter symbols appear on reels 1, 2, and 3. Players are awarded 10 free spins to be used during the bonus mode, with the chance to reactivate the mode up to five consecutive times. During each of the free spins, an extra Wild Diamond symbol appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, which increases the number of possible winning combinations. The Gamble function can multiply your winnings by guessing the color or suit of a covered card.\n\nAristocrat's experience in the industry\n\nAristocrat is an entertainment and gambling industry veteran, established in Australia in 1953.

This slot is a familiar face in the world of land-based gaming; even today it is offered with high ratings from users in the \"virtual rooms\" of AAMS online casinos. The game's theme is the savannah and its inhabitants; all the symbols, in fact, depict animals, people, or landscapes from the fantastic and expansive African continent. The game rules are among the most common; you win by aligning at least three identical symbols from left to right, and to increase your winnings, the slot offers the possibility of taking advantage of the bonus granted by free spins along with the Gamble mode.\nThe slot machine's graphics\nThe 50 Lions slot is an enduring title created in the early 2000s. Its gameplay mechanics and animations are the same as always; while the weight of its age is evident, we can still say that it is a graphically up-to-date, functional, and high-quality product. As mentioned, the symbols refer to African culture, with the most representative being the Lion, the King of the savannah, which gives the slot its name and is also the most lucrative symbol in the game. In addition to the Lion, we find: the Zebra, the Giraffe, the Natives, the Acacia tree, the letters J, Q, K, and A, and the numbers 9 and 10. The Wild symbol is represented by a Diamond, while the Scatter is represented by a Protea flower.\nThe functions and bonuses of the slot\nThis slot machine allows you to play up to 50 active pay lines, divided over 5 reels with 4 symbols each. In 50 Lions, as mentioned, you will have the Gamble function at your disposal, with which you can try to multiply each of your winnings by guessing the color or suit of a covered card. The Wild symbol of the slot, the Diamond, appears exclusively on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, and will help you complete combinations better by acting as a wildcard, replacing other symbols excluding the Scatter. To activate the free spin mode, instead, you will need the symbol with the representation of the Protea flower. This image appears only on reels 1, 2, and 3 and, with 3 of these symbols in any position, you will have 10 bonus spins to take advantage of. From time to time, during each of the free spins, a new extra Wild Diamond symbol will appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, allowing you to increase the chances of creating multiple winning combinations. This bonus mode is always reactivatable thanks to the Scatter symbol up to a maximum of 5 consecutive times.\nSimilar slots to 50 Lions\nTogether with 50 Lions, other titles branded by Aristocrat Technologies meet the same standard of play. For example, the two slot machines 50 Dragons and Miss Kitty have a layout where there are 50 pay lines divided over 5 reels of play, each of which shows 4 symbols. In addition, in both of these slots, it is possible to obtain free spins as a bonus (10 free spins for each of the slot machines, always reactivatable), and the Gamble function is also present, allowing to multiply the value of the stake just won.\n            ",

The game rules are among the most common; you win by aligning at least three identical symbols from left to right, and to increase your winnings, the slot offers the possibility of taking advantage of the bonus granted by free spins along with the Gamble mode.\nThe slot machine's graphics\nThe 50 Lions slot is an enduring title created in the early 2000s. Its gameplay mechanics and animations are the same as always; while the weight of its age is evident, we can still say that it is a graphically up-to-date, functional, and high-quality product. As mentioned, the symbols refer to African culture, with the most representative being the Lion, the King of the savannah, which gives the slot its name and is also the most lucrative symbol in the game. In addition to the Lion, we find: the Zebra, the Giraffe, the Natives, the Acacia tree, the letters J, Q, K, and A, and the numbers 9 and 10. The Wild symbol is represented by a Diamond, while the Scatter is represented by a Protea flower.\nThe functions and bonuses of the slot\nThis slot machine allows you to play up to 50 active pay lines, divided over 5 reels with 4 symbols each. In 50 Lions, as mentioned, you will have the Gamble function at your disposal, with which you can try to multiply each of your winnings by guessing the color or suit of a covered card. The Wild symbol of the slot, the Diamond, appears exclusively on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, and will help you complete combinations better by acting as a wildcard, replacing other symbols excluding the Scatter. To activate the free spin mode, instead, you will need the symbol with the representation of the Protea flower. This image appears only on reels 1, 2, and 3 and, with 3 of these symbols in any position, you will have 10 bonus spins to take advantage of. From time to time, during each of the free spins, a new extra Wild Diamond symbol will appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, allowing you to increase the chances of creating multiple winning combinations. This bonus mode is always reactivatable thanks to the Scatter symbol up to a maximum of 5 consecutive times.\nSimilar slots to 50 Lions\nTogether with 50 Lions, other titles branded by Aristocrat Technologies meet the same standard of play. For example, the two slot machines 50 Dragons and Miss Kitty have a layout where there are 50 pay lines divided over 5 reels of play, each of which shows 4 symbols. In addition, in both of these slots, it is possible to obtain free spins as a bonus (10 free spins for each of the slot machines, always reactivatable), and the Gamble function is also present, allowing to multiply the value of the stake just won.\n            ",
