    "original_text": "\nJammin Jars\nPush Gaming ha rilasciato Jammin’ Jars – un affare di slot con simboli che cadono e si raccolgono su una griglia di otto linee verticali e otto orizzontali. Oltre alla caratteristica dei simboli che crollano, il gioco offre la possibilità di vincere consecutivamente. C’è una caratteristica bonus a forma di giri liberi, e ci sono due kicker in-game, come i rulli arcobaleno che si verificano casualmente e i Jim Jar wilds, che modificano la griglia in più di un modo. Gioca per avere la possibilità di vincere 10.000 euro per il miglior payout su un Return to Player del 96,80%.\n\nUna grafica dolcissima\nLe 64 caselle sulla griglia sono piene di vari frutti e l’obiettivo del gioco, e il risultato più atteso allo stesso tempo, è quello di vedere uno qualsiasi di questi simboli formare un cluster.\nMa aspettate! Perché lo slot Jammin’ Jars si chiama Jammin’ Jars quando i simboli sono tutti frutti? Beh, c’è un simbolo di vaso che definisce il gameplay della release. Il simbolo Jam Jar Jar è fondamentalmente il Wild, che sostituisce qualsiasi simbolo, ma fa anche pochi altri trucchi da circo propri. Poiché Jammin’ Jars è un tipo di gioco “a bobine che crolla”, ogni combinazione vincente fa sì che il gruppo vincente scompaia e faccia spazio a una nuova serie di simboli. In questo caso, il simbolo Jam Jar Jar farà un movimento casuale su un’altra fila verticale dopo aver fatto parte di una combinazione vincente.\nÈ questa l’unica caratteristica del gioco? Neanche lontanamente. Anche se c’è solo un bonus in più, è uno che è degno come l’intero gioco stesso. Questo è il bonus gratuito “gira” che si ottiene grazie al – avete indovinato – sorridente Jam Jars. Diamo quindi un’occhiata ad alcuni ulteriori dettagli sul gioco, in modo che i giocatori possano arrivare alla parte in cui vedono esplodere alcuni frutti e restituire le potenziali vincite.\n\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine Jammin Jars\nOgni volta che appare il simbolo di un vasetto, probabilmente avrà un moltiplicatore, a partire da 1x a 5x. Ciò significa che le vincite del gioco di base con il barattolo saranno moltiplicate in base all’importo indicato sul barattolo. Quindi l’atterraggio di tre dei simboli Jam Jar Jar sui rulli farà scattare la funzione Free Games Feature. La stessa proprietà bonus di questo simbolo rimane durante i giri liberi, con l’aggiunta di questi che rimangono in posizione dopo un crollo o una vincita a cascata.\nInfine, ma non meno importante, la funzione arcobaleno si attiva in modo casuale dopo un testacoda non vincente. Il risultato di questo bonus è un simbolo colossale aggiunto sui rulli che può interagire con un gran numero di simboli.\nLa vincita del gioco comprende un grande cluster sulla griglia, preferibilmente uno che copre 25 o più quadrati sulla griglia. Se questo dovesse mai accadere, il fortunato giocatore vedrà dei premi in denaro abbastanza decenti. Diciamo che si gioca con 1,00 euro a giro. In questo caso, la vincita più grande da un singolo giro, basata su un simbolo di vincita del gioco di base, sarà di 100,00 euro per un cluster di 25 fragole, o più, e una vincita di 40 euro per un cluster che comprende tra 20 e 24 simboli di questo tipo.\nAltrimenti, il modo per ricevere le vincite è quello di avere i simboli sulle righe e sui rulli adiacenti Quindi, anche se appaiono cinque simboli, il premio restituirà la puntata di €1,00. Qualsiasi cosa più di 5 cluster di simboli si traduce in un ritorno più grande. Ma è qui che il simbolo Jam Jar Jar è davvero utile nella slot Jammin’ Jars. Questo barattolo colorato sorridente è il Wild e ha una proprietà bonus di spostamento a sinistra e a destra sui rulli, alla ricerca di ulteriori combinazioni vincenti.\nPer impostare il gioco per lo spin, si può vedere la finestra della Scommessa Totale che si trova al centro, appena sotto la griglia 8×8. Cliccando o toccando il simbolo della freccia verso l’alto, viene visualizzata una tabella di somme disponibili che possono essere giocate per ogni giro. Gli importi più piccoli sono 0,20€, 0,40€, 0,60€ e 1,00€. Ognuno di questi importi viene replicato ma con il punto decimale spostato a destra, una e due volte. Così nella riga successiva abbiamo importi che terminano con 10,00 euro e nella terza fila importi che sono a due cifre e terminano con 100,00 euro. Crediamo che questa gamma di scommesse offra abbastanza opzioni in modo che ogni giocatore possa trovare una somma piacevole per il suo stile di gioco e il suo budget.\n\nJammin Jars -Altre Slot Machine simili\nPurtroppo non possiamo consigliarti altre Slot Machine a tema marmellata, in quanto Jammin’ Jars, la Slot prodotta da Push Gaming, è probabilmente unica nel suo genere. Quello che possiamo fare, invece, è consigliarti Wild Frames, la Slot tradizionale prodotta da Play N Go che ti permette di vincere fino a 7,000x!\n\nDomande più frequenti - Jammin Jars \nDove posso giocare gratuitamente a Jammin Jars?\n\nSlotJava dà la possibilità di provare Jammin Jars e altre centinaia di slot gratuite.

            "response": "Jammin Jars\nPush Gaming has released Jammin' Jars - a slot game with symbols that fall and collect on an eight-by-eight vertical and horizontal grid. In addition to the cascading symbols feature, the game offers the opportunity to win consecutively. There is a free spins bonus feature, and there are two in-game kickers, like the rainbow reels that occur randomly and the Jim Jar wilds that modify the grid in more than one way. Play for a chance to win €10,000 for the best payout on a 96.80% Return to Player rate.\n\nSweet graphics\nThe 64 squares on the grid are filled with various fruits and the goal of the game, and the most anticipated outcome at the same time, is to see any of these symbols form a cluster. But wait! Why is the Jammin' Jars slot called Jammin' Jars when all the symbols are fruits? Well, there is a jar symbol that defines the gameplay of the release. The Jam Jar Jar symbol is basically the Wild, which replaces any symbol, but also does a few circus tricks of its own. Since Jammin' Jars is a type of \"falling reels\" game, every winning combination causes the winning group to disappear and make way for a new set of symbols. In this case, the Jam Jar Jar symbol will make a random move on another vertical row after being part of a winning combination.\nIs this the only feature of the game? Not even close. Although there is only one additional bonus, it is one that is as worthy as the entire game itself. This is the free spins bonus that is obtained thanks to the - you guessed it - smiling Jam Jars. Let's take a look at some additional details about the game, so that players can get to the part where they see some fruits explode and return potential winnings.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Jammin' Jars slot machine\nWhenever the jar symbol appears, it will likely have a multiplier, ranging from 1x to 5x. This means that the base game winnings with the jar will be multiplied by the amount indicated on the jar. So landing three of the Jam Jar Jar symbols on the reels will trigger the Free Games Feature. The same bonus property of this symbol remains during free spins, with the addition of them remaining in position after a cascade or a winning combo.\nLast but not least, the rainbow feature is randomly activated after a non-winning spin. The result of this bonus is a colossal symbol added to the reels that can interact with a large number of symbols.\nThe game's winning combination includes a large cluster on the grid, preferably one that covers 25 or more squares on the grid. If this ever happens, the lucky player will see fairly decent cash prizes. Let's say you're playing with a €1.00 bet per spin. In this case, the biggest win from a single spin, based on a base game winning symbol, will be €100.00 for a cluster of 25 strawberries or more, and a win of €40.00 for a cluster that includes between 20 and 24 symbols of this type.\nOtherwise, the way to get wins is to have symbols on adjacent rows and reels. So even if five symbols appear, the prize will return the €1.00 bet. Anything more than 5 symbol clusters translates into a bigger payout. But this is where the Jam Jar Jar symbol is really useful in the Jammin' Jars slot. This smiling colored jar is the Wild and has a bonus property of shifting left and right on the reels, looking for further winning combinations.\nTo set the game for the spin, you can see the Total Bet window located in the center, just below the 8×8 grid. By clicking or tapping on the up arrow symbol, a table of available sums that can be played for each spin is displayed. Smaller amounts are €0.20, €0.40, €0.60, and €1.00. Each of these amounts is replicated but with the decimal point moved to the right, once and twice. So on the next row we have amounts ending in €10.00 and in the third row amounts that are two digits and end in €100.00. We believe that this range of bets offers enough options so that every player can find a pleasant sum for their style of play and budget.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines to Jammin' Jars\nUnfortunately, we cannot recommend other Jam-themed slot machines, as Jammin' Jars, the slot produced by Push Gaming, is probably one of a kind. Instead, what we can do is recommend Wild Frames, the traditional slot produced by Play N Go that allows you to win up to 7,000x!\n\nFAQ - Jammin' Jars\nWhere can I play Jammin' Jars for free?\n\nSlotJava gives the opportunity to try Jammin' Jars and hundreds of other free slots. No registration is required and no software needs to be downloaded.\n\nCan I play Jammin' Jars with real money?\n\nCertainly, it is possible to play with real money on online casinos such as Starcasino.it and Starvegas.it, both licensed in Italy and therefore absolutely safe. If you are interested in knowing what are the best casinos accredited by the Agency of Monopolies and Customs, the promotions offered and the various no deposit bonuses, you can take a look at our guides on the site.\n\nCan I get no deposit bonuses and free spins to play Jammin' Jars?\n\nYes.

In addition to the cascading symbols feature, the game offers the opportunity to win consecutively. There is a free spins bonus feature, and there are two in-game kickers, like the rainbow reels that occur randomly and the Jim Jar wilds that modify the grid in more than one way. Play for a chance to win €10,000 for the best payout on a 96.80% Return to Player rate.\n\nSweet graphics\nThe 64 squares on the grid are filled with various fruits and the goal of the game, and the most anticipated outcome at the same time, is to see any of these symbols form a cluster. But wait! Why is the Jammin' Jars slot called Jammin' Jars when all the symbols are fruits? Well, there is a jar symbol that defines the gameplay of the release. The Jam Jar Jar symbol is basically the Wild, which replaces any symbol, but also does a few circus tricks of its own. Since Jammin' Jars is a type of \"falling reels\" game, every winning combination causes the winning group to disappear and make way for a new set of symbols. In this case, the Jam Jar Jar symbol will make a random move on another vertical row after being part of a winning combination.\nIs this the only feature of the game? Not even close. Although there is only one additional bonus, it is one that is as worthy as the entire game itself. This is the free spins bonus that is obtained thanks to the - you guessed it - smiling Jam Jars. Let's take a look at some additional details about the game, so that players can get to the part where they see some fruits explode and return potential winnings.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Jammin' Jars slot machine\nWhenever the jar symbol appears, it will likely have a multiplier, ranging from 1x to 5x. This means that the base game winnings with the jar will be multiplied by the amount indicated on the jar. So landing three of the Jam Jar Jar symbols on the reels will trigger the Free Games Feature. The same bonus property of this symbol remains during free spins, with the addition of them remaining in position after a cascade or a winning combo.\nLast but not least, the rainbow feature is randomly activated after a non-winning spin. The result of this bonus is a colossal symbol added to the reels that can interact with a large number of symbols.\nThe game's winning combination includes a large cluster on the grid, preferably one that covers 25 or more squares on the grid. If this ever happens, the lucky player will see fairly decent cash prizes. Let's say you're playing with a €1.00 bet per spin. In this case, the biggest win from a single spin, based on a base game winning symbol, will be €100.00 for a cluster of 25 strawberries or more, and a win of €40.00 for a cluster that includes between 20 and 24 symbols of this type.\nOtherwise, the way to get wins is to have symbols on adjacent rows and reels. So even if five symbols appear, the prize will return the €1.00 bet. Anything more than 5 symbol clusters translates into a bigger payout. But this is where the Jam Jar Jar symbol is really useful in the Jammin' Jars slot. This smiling colored jar is the Wild and has a bonus property of shifting left and right on the reels, looking for further winning combinations.\nTo set the game for the spin, you can see the Total Bet window located in the center, just below the 8×8 grid. By clicking or tapping on the up arrow symbol, a table of available sums that can be played for each spin is displayed. Smaller amounts are €0.20, €0.40, €0.60, and €1.00. Each of these amounts is replicated but with the decimal point moved to the right, once and twice. So on the next row we have amounts ending in €10.00 and in the third row amounts that are two digits and end in €100.00. We believe that this range of bets offers enough options so that every player can find a pleasant sum for their style of play and budget.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines to Jammin' Jars\nUnfortunately, we cannot recommend other Jam-themed slot machines, as Jammin' Jars, the slot produced by Push Gaming, is probably one of a kind. Instead, what we can do is recommend Wild Frames, the traditional slot produced by Play N Go that allows you to win up to 7,000x!\n\nFAQ - Jammin' Jars\nWhere can I play Jammin' Jars for free?\n\nSlotJava gives the opportunity to try Jammin' Jars and hundreds of other free slots. No registration is required and no software needs to be downloaded.\n\nCan I play Jammin' Jars with real money?\n\nCertainly, it is possible to play with real money on online casinos such as Starcasino.it and Starvegas.it, both licensed in Italy and therefore absolutely safe. If you are interested in knowing what are the best casinos accredited by the Agency of Monopolies and Customs, the promotions offered and the various no deposit bonuses, you can take a look at our guides on the site.\n\nCan I get no deposit bonuses and free spins to play Jammin' Jars?\n\nYes. Among the many peculiarities of online slots, one of them is the ability to play without needing to make a deposit of real money, in addition to being able to take advantage of a limited number of free spins. To know what are the promotions of casinos, you just need to consult the guides present on SlotJava. To give some examples, 888 casino offers €20 for free upon registration."

In addition to the cascading symbols feature, the game offers the opportunity to win consecutively. There is a free spins bonus feature, and there are two in-game kickers, like the rainbow reels that occur randomly and the Jim Jar wilds that modify the grid in more than one way. Play for a chance to win €10,000 for the best payout on a 96.80% Return to Player rate.\n\nSweet graphics\nThe 64 squares on the grid are filled with various fruits and the goal of the game, and the most anticipated outcome at the same time, is to see any of these symbols form a cluster. But wait! Why is the Jammin' Jars slot called Jammin' Jars when all the symbols are fruits? Well, there is a jar symbol that defines the gameplay of the release. The Jam Jar Jar symbol is basically the Wild, which replaces any symbol, but also does a few circus tricks of its own. Since Jammin' Jars is a type of \"falling reels\" game, every winning combination causes the winning group to disappear and make way for a new set of symbols. In this case, the Jam Jar Jar symbol will make a random move on another vertical row after being part of a winning combination.\nIs this the only feature of the game? Not even close. Although there is only one additional bonus, it is one that is as worthy as the entire game itself. This is the free spins bonus that is obtained thanks to the - you guessed it - smiling Jam Jars. Let's take a look at some additional details about the game, so that players can get to the part where they see some fruits explode and return potential winnings.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Jammin' Jars slot machine\nWhenever the jar symbol appears, it will likely have a multiplier, ranging from 1x to 5x. This means that the base game winnings with the jar will be multiplied by the amount indicated on the jar. So landing three of the Jam Jar Jar symbols on the reels will trigger the Free Games Feature. The same bonus property of this symbol remains during free spins, with the addition of them remaining in position after a cascade or a winning combo.\nLast but not least, the rainbow feature is randomly activated after a non-winning spin. The result of this bonus is a colossal symbol added to the reels that can interact with a large number of symbols.\nThe game's winning combination includes a large cluster on the grid, preferably one that covers 25 or more squares on the grid. If this ever happens, the lucky player will see fairly decent cash prizes. Let's say you're playing with a €1.00 bet per spin. In this case, the biggest win from a single spin, based on a base game winning symbol, will be €100.00 for a cluster of 25 strawberries or more, and a win of €40.00 for a cluster that includes between 20 and 24 symbols of this type.\nOtherwise, the way to get wins is to have symbols on adjacent rows and reels. So even if five symbols appear, the prize will return the €1.00 bet. Anything more than 5 symbol clusters translates into a bigger payout. But this is where the Jam Jar Jar symbol is really useful in the Jammin' Jars slot. This smiling colored jar is the Wild and has a bonus property of shifting left and right on the reels, looking for further winning combinations.\nTo set the game for the spin, you can see the Total Bet window located in the center, just below the 8×8 grid. By clicking or tapping on the up arrow symbol, a table of available sums that can be played for each spin is displayed. Smaller amounts are €0.20, €0.40, €0.60, and €1.00. Each of these amounts is replicated but with the decimal point moved to the right, once and twice. So on the next row we have amounts ending in €10.00 and in the third row amounts that are two digits and end in €100.00. We believe that this range of bets offers enough options so that every player can find a pleasant sum for their style of play and budget.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines to Jammin' Jars\nUnfortunately, we cannot recommend other Jam-themed slot machines, as Jammin' Jars, the slot produced by Push Gaming, is probably one of a kind. Instead, what we can do is recommend Wild Frames, the traditional slot produced by Play N Go that allows you to win up to 7,000x!\n\nFAQ - Jammin' Jars\nWhere can I play Jammin' Jars for free?\n\nSlotJava gives the opportunity to try Jammin' Jars and hundreds of other free slots. No registration is required and no software needs to be downloaded.\n\nCan I play Jammin' Jars with real money?\n\nCertainly, it is possible to play with real money on online casinos such as Starcasino.it and Starvegas.it, both licensed in Italy and therefore absolutely safe. If you are interested in knowing what are the best casinos accredited by the Agency of Monopolies and Customs, the promotions offered and the various no deposit bonuses, you can take a look at our guides on the site.\n\nCan I get no deposit bonuses and free spins to play Jammin' Jars?\n\nYes. Among the many peculiarities of online slots, one of them is the ability to play without needing to make a deposit of real money, in addition to being able to take advantage of a limited number of free spins. To know what are the promotions of casinos, you just need to consult the guides present on SlotJava. To give some examples, 888 casino offers €20 for free upon registration.\n            ",

Besides the cascading symbols feature, the game offers the opportunity to win consecutively.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game's winning combination includes a large cluster on the grid, preferably, one that covers 25 or more squares on the grid. The symbol 'Jam Jar Jar' acts as a Wild, replacing any symbol, and moves randomly to another vertical row after being part of a winning combination. The game also includes a free spins bonus and a rainbow feature that adds a colossal symbol to the reels.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe game offers two in-game kickers, the rainbow reels, which occur randomly, and Jim Jar wilds that modify the grid in more than one way. The free spins bonus property is triggered when three Jam Jar Jar symbols land on the reels.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe 64 squares on the grid are filled with various fruits, and the game uses sweet graphics to make the symbols come alive.\n\nRainbow Reels\n\nThis feature is randomly activated when there's a non-winning spin, and it adds a colossal symbol to the reels that can interact with a large number of symbols.\n\nJam Jar Wilds\n\nWhenever the Jam Jar Jar symbol appears, it acts as a Wild, replacing any symbol on the reels. It will likely have a multiplier ranging from 1x to 5x, which means that the base game winnings with the jar will be multiplied by the amount indicated on the jar. If the symbol appears three times on the reels, it triggers the game's free spins bonus feature. The same bonus property remains during free spins, and the jar symbols remain in position after a cascade or a winning combo.\n\nWinning Combinations\n\nThe game's winning combination requires a large cluster on the grid, covering 25 or more squares on the grid. The biggest win from a single spin, based on a base game winning symbol, will be €100.00 for a cluster of 25 strawberries or more, and a win of €40.00 for a cluster that includes between 20 and 24 symbols of this type. Symbols on adjacent rows and reels trigger wins, and five symbols appearing on the reels return the €1.00 bet. Clusters with more than five symbols translate into bigger payouts, and the Jam Jar Jar symbol is useful in looking for further winning combinations.\n\nBetting Range\n\nThe game's betting range offers several options for players according to their style of play and budget. Bets can start from €0.20 and go up to €100.00 per spin with several denominations in between. Players can adjust the total bet by clicking or tapping on the up arrow symbol located in the center, just below the 8×8 grid.\n\n        \n            ",

In addition to the cascading symbols feature, the game offers the opportunity to win consecutively. There is a free spins bonus feature, and there are two in-game kickers, like the rainbow reels that occur randomly and the Jim Jar wilds that modify the grid in more than one way. Play for a chance to win €10,000 for the best payout on a 96.80% Return to Player rate.\n\nSweet graphics\nThe 64 squares on the grid are filled with various fruits and the goal of the game, and the most anticipated outcome at the same time, is to see any of these symbols form a cluster. But wait! Why is the Jammin' Jars slot called Jammin' Jars when all the symbols are fruits? Well, there is a jar symbol that defines the gameplay of the release. The Jam Jar Jar symbol is basically the Wild, which replaces any symbol, but also does a few circus tricks of its own. Since Jammin' Jars is a type of \"falling reels\" game, every winning combination causes the winning group to disappear and make way for a new set of symbols. In this case, the Jam Jar Jar symbol will make a random move on another vertical row after being part of a winning combination.\nIs this the only feature of the game? Not even close. Although there is only one additional bonus, it is one that is as worthy as the entire game itself. This is the free spins bonus that is obtained thanks to the - you guessed it - smiling Jam Jars. Let's take a look at some additional details about the game, so that players can get to the part where they see some fruits explode and return potential winnings.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Jammin' Jars slot machine\nWhenever the jar symbol appears, it will likely have a multiplier, ranging from 1x to 5x. This means that the base game winnings with the jar will be multiplied by the amount indicated on the jar. So landing three of the Jam Jar Jar symbols on the reels will trigger the Free Games Feature. The same bonus property of this symbol remains during free spins, with the addition of them remaining in position after a cascade or a winning combo.\nLast but not least, the rainbow feature is randomly activated after a non-winning spin. The result of this bonus is a colossal symbol added to the reels that can interact with a large number of symbols.\nThe game's winning combination includes a large cluster on the grid, preferably one that covers 25 or more squares on the grid. If this ever happens, the lucky player will see fairly decent cash prizes. Let's say you're playing with a €1.00 bet per spin. In this case, the biggest win from a single spin, based on a base game winning symbol, will be €100.00 for a cluster of 25 strawberries or more, and a win of €40.00 for a cluster that includes between 20 and 24 symbols of this type.\nOtherwise, the way to get wins is to have symbols on adjacent rows and reels. So even if five symbols appear, the prize will return the €1.00 bet. Anything more than 5 symbol clusters translates into a bigger payout. But this is where the Jam Jar Jar symbol is really useful in the Jammin' Jars slot. This smiling colored jar is the Wild and has a bonus property of shifting left and right on the reels, looking for further winning combinations.\nTo set the game for the spin, you can see the Total Bet window located in the center, just below the 8×8 grid. By clicking or tapping on the up arrow symbol, a table of available sums that can be played for each spin is displayed. Smaller amounts are €0.20, €0.40, €0.60, and €1.00. Each of these amounts is replicated but with the decimal point moved to the right, once and twice. So on the next row we have amounts ending in €10.00 and in the third row amounts that are two digits and end in €100.00. We believe that this range of bets offers enough options so that every player can find a pleasant sum for their style of play and budget.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines to Jammin' Jars\nUnfortunately, we cannot recommend other Jam-themed slot machines, as Jammin' Jars, the slot produced by Push Gaming, is probably one of a kind. Instead, what we can do is recommend Wild Frames, the traditional slot produced by Play N Go that allows you to win up to 7,000x!\n\nFAQ - Jammin' Jars\nWhere can I play Jammin' Jars for free?\n\nSlotJava gives the opportunity to try Jammin' Jars and hundreds of other free slots. No registration is required and no software needs to be downloaded.\n\nCan I play Jammin' Jars with real money?\n\nCertainly, it is possible to play with real money on online casinos such as Starcasino.it and Starvegas.it, both licensed in Italy and therefore absolutely safe. If you are interested in knowing what are the best casinos accredited by the Agency of Monopolies and Customs, the promotions offered and the various no deposit bonuses, you can take a look at our guides on the site.\n\nCan I get no deposit bonuses and free spins to play Jammin' Jars?\n\nYes. Among the many peculiarities of online slots, one of them is the ability to play without needing to make a deposit of real money, in addition to being able to take advantage of a limited number of free spins. To know what are the promotions of casinos, you just need to consult the guides present on SlotJava. To give some examples, 888 casino offers €20 for free upon registration.\n            ",

In this case, the Jam Jar Jar symbol will make a random move on another vertical row after being part of a winning combination.\nIs this the only feature of the game? Not even close. Although there is only one additional bonus, it is one that is as worthy as the entire game itself. This is the free spins bonus that is obtained thanks to the - you guessed it - smiling Jam Jars. Let's take a look at some additional details about the game, so that players can get to the part where they see some fruits explode and return potential winnings.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Jammin' Jars slot machine\nWhenever the jar symbol appears, it will likely have a multiplier, ranging from 1x to 5x. This means that the base game winnings with the jar will be multiplied by the amount indicated on the jar. So landing three of the Jam Jar Jar symbols on the reels will trigger the Free Games Feature. The same bonus property of this symbol remains during free spins, with the addition of them remaining in position after a cascade or a winning combo.\nLast but not least, the rainbow feature is randomly activated after a non-winning spin. The result of this bonus is a colossal symbol added to the reels that can interact with a large number of symbols.\nThe game's winning combination includes a large cluster on the grid, preferably one that covers 25 or more squares on the grid. If this ever happens, the lucky player will see fairly decent cash prizes. Let's say you're playing with a €1.00 bet per spin. In this case, the biggest win from a single spin, based on a base game winning symbol, will be €100.00 for a cluster of 25 strawberries or more, and a win of €40.00 for a cluster that includes between 20 and 24 symbols of this type.\nOtherwise, the way to get wins is to have symbols on adjacent rows and reels. So even if five symbols appear, the prize will return the €1.00 bet. Anything more than 5 symbol clusters translates into a bigger payout. But this is where the Jam Jar Jar symbol is really useful in the Jammin' Jars slot. This smiling colored jar is the Wild and has a bonus property of shifting left and right on the reels, looking for further winning combinations.\nTo set the game for the spin, you can see the Total Bet window located in the center, just below the 8×8 grid. By clicking or tapping on the up arrow symbol, a table of available sums that can be played for each spin is displayed. Smaller amounts are €0.20, €0.40, €0.60, and €1.00. Each of these amounts is replicated but with the decimal point moved to the right, once and twice. So on the next row we have amounts ending in €10.00 and in the third row amounts that are two digits and end in €100.00. We believe that this range of bets offers enough options so that every player can find a pleasant sum for their style of play and budget.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines to Jammin' Jars\nUnfortunately, we cannot recommend other Jam-themed slot machines, as Jammin' Jars, the slot produced by Push Gaming, is probably one of a kind. Instead, what we can do is recommend Wild Frames, the traditional slot produced by Play N Go that allows you to win up to 7,000x!\n\nFAQ - Jammin' Jars\nWhere can I play Jammin' Jars for free?\n\nSlotJava gives the opportunity to try Jammin' Jars and hundreds of other free slots.
