Among the most loved historical periods in the industry, we can certainly find ancient Greece: thanks to its numerous gods and epic poems originating from those distant times, the Hellenic peninsula remains one of the most sought-after themes for a slot machine.\nAge of the Gods Epic Troy from Playtech bears witness to this, a title we will avoid repeating in our review due to its length deriving from the Iliad, the story of the siege of Troy by the great Greek heroes such as Achilles and Ulysses.\nIn this in-depth analysis, we will delve into all the features of this title.\nAge of the Gods Epic Troy - A Colourful Story\nLet's start by talking about the graphic aspect of this slot, after all, the eye also wants its share. The background on which the game grid is positioned resembles a Greek city: mausoleums and marble statues stand on either side of the grid, with the light filtering and hitting the game screen.\nIn the center, we find the symbols, which show a style that has chosen to privilege color over a classic depiction style. Although this may raise eyebrows among classicists, it should be said that the choice of bright and different colors allows the symbols not to be confused, a risk that is not so rare in slots of this kind.\nEven the sounds don't particularly match the theme, using jingles already used in slot games with a more modern feel (while the music maintains an epic style).\nLet's see what we can expect from a purely technical point of view.\nAge of the Gods Epic Troy\nWe are faced with a 5*3 slot game with fifteen symbols shown on each spin. If this introduction might make us think of one of the many titles available online, it is best to brace ourselves to be ready for the different innovations brought by this slot game.\nFirst of all, it has 243 paylines, promising not only a large number of combinations but also of rather high value.\nIn addition, there are several bonus modes: the first is associated with Helen of Troy, the abducted lady who sparked the eponymous war. This bonus will appear when we get enough Helen symbols on the game screen: we will then be awarded three free spins with the Helen symbols locked in place. Every time we find a new one, it will be locked together with the others and will reset the number of spins available to three.\nBut this, of course, is just the tip of the iceberg that is this slot game.\nSimilar slots to Age of the Gods Epic Troy\nAs we said earlier, the Greek theme is not new to the world of slot machines: for example, we find 300 Shields (with a Spartan theme), Apollo, Ares God of War, and many others.\n            ",

Among the most loved historical periods in the industry, we can certainly find ancient Greece: thanks to its numerous gods and epic poems originating from those distant times, the Hellenic peninsula remains one of the most sought-after themes for a slot machine.\nAge of the Gods Epic Troy from Playtech bears witness to this, a title we will avoid repeating in our review due to its length deriving from the Iliad, the story of the siege of Troy by the great Greek heroes such as Achilles and Ulysses.\nIn this in-depth analysis, we will delve into all the features of this title.\nAge of the Gods Epic Troy - A Colourful Story\nLet's start by talking about the graphic aspect of this slot, after all, the eye also wants its share. The background on which the game grid is positioned resembles a Greek city: mausoleums and marble statues stand on either side of the grid, with the light filtering and hitting the game screen.\nIn the center, we find the symbols, which show a style that has chosen to privilege color over a classic depiction style. Although this may raise eyebrows among classicists, it should be said that the choice of bright and different colors allows the symbols not to be confused, a risk that is not so rare in slots of this kind.\nEven the sounds don't particularly match the theme, using jingles already used in slot games with a more modern feel (while the music maintains an epic style).\nLet's see what we can expect from a purely technical point of view.\nAge of the Gods Epic Troy\nWe are faced with a 5*3 slot game with fifteen symbols shown on each spin. If this introduction might make us think of one of the many titles available online, it is best to brace ourselves to be ready for the different innovations brought by this slot game.\nFirst of all, it has 243 paylines, promising not only a large number of combinations but also of rather high value.\nIn addition, there are several bonus modes: the first is associated with Helen of Troy, the abducted lady who sparked the eponymous war. This bonus will appear when we get enough Helen symbols on the game screen: we will then be awarded three free spins with the Helen symbols locked in place. Every time we find a new one, it will be locked together with the others and will reset the number of spins available to three.\nBut this, of course, is just the tip of the iceberg that is this slot game.\nSimilar slots to Age of the Gods Epic Troy\nAs we said earlier, the Greek theme is not new to the world of slot machines: for example, we find 300 Shields (with a Spartan theme), Apollo, Ares God of War, and many others.\n        ",
