Tra i simboli regolari, quelli che pagano di meno sono le lettere e i numeri che corrispondono alle carte da poker dal 9 all’Asso, mentre i simboli tematici sono quelli con più valore.\nOltre ai volti dei quattro protagonisti, abbiamo altri simboli a tema vampiresco, come il battente di un portone o la candela che illumina un libro.\nIl simbolo della slot con la scritta “Immortal Romance” è un Wild che funge da jolly e assicura delle vincite nel caso compaia più volte sui rulli.\nIl battente a forma di testa di leone è invece il simbolo Scatter: per ottenere una vincita è necessario che compaia per due volte in una qualsiasi posizione. Se succede per tre o più volte, allora si accederà in maniera automatica alle varie camere dei Free Spins.\nLe “Chambers of Spins”: come ottenere vincite e tanti giri gratuiti\nLa Chambers of Spins, che si attiva con tre o più scatter, permette di accedere ad ulteriori camere di gioco secondo queste modalità:\n\nPartita Bonus Amber: sbloccata con un accesso alla Chambers\nPartita bonus Troy: dopo aver giocato la partita bonus per almeno 5 volte\nPartita Bonus Michael: dopo 10 partite bonus\nPartita Bonus Sarah: dopo 15 partite Bonus.\n\nCiascuna di queste partite bonus permette di ottenere a sua volta un numero di giri gratuiti fino a 25, e di raggiungere ricchi moltiplicatori che potrebbero incrementare il vostro montepremi!\n",

Microgaming certainly meets our expectations, as the game immerses us in an atmosphere worthy of the most captivating vampire tales as we spin the reels. Admittedly, the idea is not particularly original, as the theme of the impossible relationship between mortals and immortals, humans and vampires, has been widely explored in cinema, literature, and TV series. Furthermore, vampires have already been used in slot games, such as the successful Blood Suckers series. However, what we appreciate about this slot game is that it is set up like an actual story, complete with main characters, including the witch Amber, two vampires named Troy and Michael, and the inevitable human Sarah who develops feelings for the vampire. Immortal Romance is a 5-reel slot game that offers up to 243 ways to win, a Wild symbol, a Scatter symbol, and various ways to access free spins.\n\nSymbols in Immortal Romance:\nThis Microgaming slot game features both regular and special symbols with different values. The ones that pay the least are the letters and numbers corresponding to the poker cards 9 to Ace, while the thematic symbols have a higher value. Aside from the faces of the four main characters, we have other vampire-themed symbols, such as a lion-shaped door knocker and a candle illuminating a book. The slot game's symbol with the words \"Immortal Romance\" is a Wild that serves as a substitute and generates payouts when it appears multiple times on the reels. On the other hand, the Scatter symbol is a lion's head door knocker, which needs to appear at least twice in any position to generate a payout. If it appears three or more times, players automatically access the various Chambers of Spins.\n\nChambers of Spins: How to Obtain Wins and Plenty of Free Spins\nWhen players access the Chambers of Spins with three or more Scatters, they can access additional gameplay rooms in the following ways:\n\nAmber Bonus Round: unlocked with access to the Chambers.\nTroy Bonus Round: after playing the bonus round at least five times.\nMichael Bonus Round: after 10 bonus rounds.\nSarah Bonus Round: after 15 bonus rounds.\n\nEach bonus round allows players to obtain a varying number of free spins of up to 25 while reaching rich multipliers that could increase their winnings.",

The Amber Bonus Round is unlocked with access to the Chambers, while players need to play the bonus round at least five times to unlock the Troy Bonus Round. The Michael Bonus Round requires 10 bonus rounds, and the Sarah Bonus Round unlocks after 15 bonus rounds.

Players are invited to experience an impossible love story between humans and vampires, as they spin the reels to uncover the game's intriguing storyline. With its witch, vampires, and human main characters, Microgaming's Immortal Romance offers an engaging theme that is sure to captivate players.\n\nGameplay and Mechanics: 243 Ways to Win\n\nImmortal Romance is a 5-reel slot game that offers players up to 243 ways to win. This format means that players can win by landing the same symbol in adjacent reels from left to right. Additionally, the game features a Wild symbol that can substitute for any other symbol except for the Scatter, to help create winning combinations. The game also features a 'goals' function in the payout table that helps players keep track of what pays out and how much.\n\nSymbols and Wild/Scatter Functionalities\n\nImmortal Romance features regular and special symbols with varying values. The lowest paying symbols are the poker cards 9 to Ace, while the thematic symbols have a higher value. These include the four main characters, a lion-shaped door knocker and a candle illuminating a book. The Wild symbol is a symbol with the game's title which can substitute for any other symbol except for the Scatter, while generating payouts. The Scatter symbol is a lion's head door knocker that generates payouts when it appears at least twice on the reels.\n\nChambers of Spins Bonus Rounds: Unlock the Secrets\n\nThe game's Chambers of Spins bonus rounds offer players a varied gameplay experience depending on which character's bonus round they unlock. Amber's bonus round is unlocked with access to the Chambers, while the other three characters' bonus rounds are unlocked after playing their respective bonus rounds a certain number of times. Each of the bonus rounds allows players to obtain a varying number of free spins of up to 25. Additionally, players can reach rich multipliers that could increase their winnings.\n\nFree Spins and Multipliers: An Added Bonus\n\nFree spins and multipliers are an added bonus for players who unlock the Chambers of Spins bonus rounds. With a maximum of 25 free spins and multipliers, players can train to score big wins. Whether they unlock Amber's, Troy's or Michael's Chamber of Spins after a certain number of rounds, or Sarah's after playing her chamber 15 times, there is no question that this game has plenty to offer for those who love bonus rounds with free spins.\n\n        \n            ",

Microgaming certainly meets our expectations, as the game immerses us in an atmosphere worthy of the most captivating vampire tales as we spin the reels. Admittedly, the idea is not particularly original, as the theme of the impossible relationship between mortals and immortals, humans and vampires, has been widely explored in cinema, literature, and TV series. Furthermore, vampires have already been used in slot games, such as the successful Blood Suckers series. However, what we appreciate about this slot game is that it is set up like an actual story, complete with main characters, including the witch Amber, two vampires named Troy and Michael, and the inevitable human Sarah who develops feelings for the vampire. Immortal Romance is a 5-reel slot game that offers up to 243 ways to win, a Wild symbol, a Scatter symbol, and various ways to access free spins.\n\nSymbols in Immortal Romance:\nThis Microgaming slot game features both regular and special symbols with different values. The ones that pay the least are the letters and numbers corresponding to the poker cards 9 to Ace, while the thematic symbols have a higher value. Aside from the faces of the four main characters, we have other vampire-themed symbols, such as a lion-shaped door knocker and a candle illuminating a book. The slot game's symbol with the words \"Immortal Romance\" is a Wild that serves as a substitute and generates payouts when it appears multiple times on the reels. On the other hand, the Scatter symbol is a lion's head door knocker, which needs to appear at least twice in any position to generate a payout. If it appears three or more times, players automatically access the various Chambers of Spins.\n\nChambers of Spins: How to Obtain Wins and Plenty of Free Spins\nWhen players access the Chambers of Spins with three or more Scatters, they can access additional gameplay rooms in the following ways:\n\nAmber Bonus Round: unlocked with access to the Chambers.\nTroy Bonus Round: after playing the bonus round at least five times.\nMichael Bonus Round: after 10 bonus rounds.\nSarah Bonus Round: after 15 bonus rounds.\n\nEach bonus round allows players to obtain a varying number of free spins of up to 25 while reaching rich multipliers that could increase their winnings.\n            ",

Microgaming certainly meets our expectations, as the game immerses us in an atmosphere worthy of the most captivating vampire tales as we spin the reels. Admittedly, the idea is not particularly original, as the theme of the impossible relationship between mortals and immortals, humans and vampires, has been widely explored in cinema, literature, and TV series. Furthermore, vampires have already been used in slot games, such as the successful Blood Suckers series. However, what we appreciate about this slot game is that it is set up like an actual story, complete with main characters, including the witch Amber, two vampires named Troy and Michael, and the inevitable human Sarah who develops feelings for the vampire. Immortal Romance is a 5-reel slot game that offers up to 243 ways to win, a Wild symbol, a Scatter symbol, and various ways to access free spins.\n\nSymbols in Immortal Romance:\nThis Microgaming slot game features both regular and special symbols with different values. The ones that pay the least are the letters and numbers corresponding to the poker cards 9 to Ace, while the thematic symbols have a higher value. Aside from the faces of the four main characters, we have other vampire-themed symbols, such as a lion-shaped door knocker and a candle illuminating a book. The slot game's symbol with the words \"Immortal Romance\" is a Wild that serves as a substitute and generates payouts when it appears multiple times on the reels. On the other hand, the Scatter symbol is a lion's head door knocker, which needs to appear at least twice in any position to generate a payout. If it appears three or more times, players automatically access the various Chambers of Spins.\n\nChambers of Spins: How to Obtain Wins and Plenty of Free Spins\nWhen players access the Chambers of Spins with three or more Scatters, they can access additional gameplay rooms in the following ways:\n\nAmber Bonus Round: unlocked with access to the Chambers.\nTroy Bonus Round: after playing the bonus round at least five times.\nMichael Bonus Round: after 10 bonus rounds.\nSarah Bonus Round: after 15 bonus rounds.\n\nEach bonus round allows players to obtain a varying number of free spins of up to 25 while reaching rich multipliers that could increase their winnings.\n        ",
