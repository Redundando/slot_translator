Lucky Sushi is a witty and playful world that puts us in front of a game dedicated to all lovers of Japanese sushi. The manufacturer Tuko has decided to reinterpret the oriental style and launch it in the online gambling sector. Don't expect temples or magical and spiritual atmospheres, but it's the typical Japanese food that conquers us during gameplay. The player has the opportunity to enter a themed restaurant and play with the delicious dishes that will be positioned on 5 reels, to take advantage of the 20 paylines. Below we will discover the technical and graphic features of this online slot machine, as well as all the curiosities that make it so enchanting for experienced and new entry players.\nGraphics and game functions\nAt the graphic level, we notice that in this case Tuko has done a much more thorough job than with other titles. Lucky Sushi is very well made and recreates the atmosphere you breathe when entering a typical Japanese restaurant. The set of symbols that make this machine unique are also very realistic: they range from Nigiri dishes to Uramaki and Maki. The symbol of the Cat, which is a very important lucky charm in Japanese culture, is also introduced into the game. It is no coincidence that it was chosen as a Wild Symbol, capable of exploiting all the potential that are typical of a joker. It allows so to facilitate the creation of lucky combinations, by replacing the dishes we see on the table. Another important symbol is the Scatter (a red lantern), which is used to favor the activation of a free spin bonus, but also to generate the multipliers that increase the value of a normal game bet. This happens if it appears in any position on the reels in 3 or more boxes. With 3 Lanterns, 5 free spins are activated and if you make a winning one, the course of the game will change. At that point, the reels will move with a rightward movement, and only the first reel will spin. But the bonuses that you encounter during the game are different.\nFinal thoughts on the Lucky Sushi slot machine\nAnother very interesting bonus that we found is the one that arises from the combination of 3 or more Ramen Bowl symbols on reels 2, 3 or 4. Here a new screen will open which places 3 covered trays in the center of the screen. By opening the selected lid, the player can win the prize contained inside. Consider that the return on investment for the player is in line with the games made by this software house, that is equal to a percentage of 96.30%.\nThe game has a minimum bet of 0.02 cents and can reach up to 20 euros. The default bet is set at 0.2€ with the possibility of using one coin per payline. Overall, we have 20 paylines and a number of free spins that reaches a maximum of 5. So, what do you say, is it time to enter this restaurant?\n            ",

Lucky Sushi is a witty and playful world that puts us in front of a game dedicated to all lovers of Japanese sushi. The manufacturer Tuko has decided to reinterpret the oriental style and launch it in the online gambling sector. Don't expect temples or magical and spiritual atmospheres, but it's the typical Japanese food that conquers us during gameplay. The player has the opportunity to enter a themed restaurant and play with the delicious dishes that will be positioned on 5 reels, to take advantage of the 20 paylines. Below we will discover the technical and graphic features of this online slot machine, as well as all the curiosities that make it so enchanting for experienced and new entry players.\nGraphics and game functions\nAt the graphic level, we notice that in this case Tuko has done a much more thorough job than with other titles. Lucky Sushi is very well made and recreates the atmosphere you breathe when entering a typical Japanese restaurant. The set of symbols that make this machine unique are also very realistic: they range from Nigiri dishes to Uramaki and Maki. The symbol of the Cat, which is a very important lucky charm in Japanese culture, is also introduced into the game. It is no coincidence that it was chosen as a Wild Symbol, capable of exploiting all the potential that are typical of a joker. It allows so to facilitate the creation of lucky combinations, by replacing the dishes we see on the table. Another important symbol is the Scatter (a red lantern), which is used to favor the activation of a free spin bonus, but also to generate the multipliers that increase the value of a normal game bet. This happens if it appears in any position on the reels in 3 or more boxes. With 3 Lanterns, 5 free spins are activated and if you make a winning one, the course of the game will change. At that point, the reels will move with a rightward movement, and only the first reel will spin. But the bonuses that you encounter during the game are different.\nFinal thoughts on the Lucky Sushi slot machine\nAnother very interesting bonus that we found is the one that arises from the combination of 3 or more Ramen Bowl symbols on reels 2, 3 or 4. Here a new screen will open which places 3 covered trays in the center of the screen. By opening the selected lid, the player can win the prize contained inside. Consider that the return on investment for the player is in line with the games made by this software house, that is equal to a percentage of 96.30%.\nThe game has a minimum bet of 0.02 cents and can reach up to 20 euros. The default bet is set at 0.2€ with the possibility of using one coin per payline. Overall, we have 20 paylines and a number of free spins that reaches a maximum of 5. So, what do you say, is it time to enter this restaurant?\n            ",

Lucky Sushi is a witty and playful world that puts us in front of a game dedicated to all lovers of Japanese sushi. The manufacturer Tuko has decided to reinterpret the oriental style and launch it in the online gambling sector. Don't expect temples or magical and spiritual atmospheres, but it's the typical Japanese food that conquers us during gameplay. The player has the opportunity to enter a themed restaurant and play with the delicious dishes that will be positioned on 5 reels, to take advantage of the 20 paylines. Below we will discover the technical and graphic features of this online slot machine, as well as all the curiosities that make it so enchanting for experienced and new entry players.\nGraphics and game functions\nAt the graphic level, we notice that in this case Tuko has done a much more thorough job than with other titles. Lucky Sushi is very well made and recreates the atmosphere you breathe when entering a typical Japanese restaurant. The set of symbols that make this machine unique are also very realistic: they range from Nigiri dishes to Uramaki and Maki. The symbol of the Cat, which is a very important lucky charm in Japanese culture, is also introduced into the game. It is no coincidence that it was chosen as a Wild Symbol, capable of exploiting all the potential that are typical of a joker. It allows so to facilitate the creation of lucky combinations, by replacing the dishes we see on the table. Another important symbol is the Scatter (a red lantern), which is used to favor the activation of a free spin bonus, but also to generate the multipliers that increase the value of a normal game bet. This happens if it appears in any position on the reels in 3 or more boxes. With 3 Lanterns, 5 free spins are activated and if you make a winning one, the course of the game will change. At that point, the reels will move with a rightward movement, and only the first reel will spin. But the bonuses that you encounter during the game are different.\nFinal thoughts on the Lucky Sushi slot machine\nAnother very interesting bonus that we found is the one that arises from the combination of 3 or more Ramen Bowl symbols on reels 2, 3 or 4. Here a new screen will open which places 3 covered trays in the center of the screen. By opening the selected lid, the player can win the prize contained inside. Consider that the return on investment for the player is in line with the games made by this software house, that is equal to a percentage of 96.30%.\nThe game has a minimum bet of 0.02 cents and can reach up to 20 euros. The default bet is set at 0.2€ with the possibility of using one coin per payline. Overall, we have 20 paylines and a number of free spins that reaches a maximum of 5. So, what do you say, is it time to enter this restaurant?\n        ",
