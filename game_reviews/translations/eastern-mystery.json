When this feature is active, the red and blue Jewel symbols may also appear. How do they differ?\n\nThe Red Jewel will replace all symbols except the Eastern Mystery symbol, while the Blue Jewel symbol will create a winning combination. Be careful, because if the blue jewel substitutes on reel 2, it will multiply a winning line by 1x or 2x and if it substitutes on reel 4, the multiplier will be 1x or 5x. If the 2x or 5x multipliers appear together, you will get a win of 10x.\n\nFAQ\n\nCan I buy free spins in Eastern Mystery?\n\nNo, you can only get free spins in Eastern Mystery if you land on a special symbol and multipliers if red and blue jewels appear.\n\nIs it possible to change the number of paylines in Eastern Mystery?\n\nNo, the 50 paylines in Eastern Mystery are fixed and cannot be changed. If you're looking for this feature, take a look at the free slots in our Spearhead catalog.\n\nCan I reactivate free spins in Eastern Mystery?\n\nYou can get 5 additional FS, but only if you land on 3 or more Eastern Mystery symbols during the Free Spins feature.\n        ",

How do they differ?\n\nThe Red Jewel will replace all symbols except the Eastern Mystery symbol, while the Blue Jewel symbol will create a winning combination. Be careful, because if the blue jewel substitutes on reel 2, it will multiply a winning line by 1x or 2x and if it substitutes on reel 4, the multiplier will be 1x or 5x. If the 2x or 5x multipliers appear together, you will get a win of 10x.\n\nFAQ\n\nCan I buy free spins in Eastern Mystery?\n\nNo, you can only get free spins in Eastern Mystery if you land on a special symbol and multipliers if red and blue jewels appear.\n\nIs it possible to change the number of paylines in Eastern Mystery?\n\nNo, the 50 paylines in Eastern Mystery are fixed and cannot be changed. If you're looking for this feature, take a look at the free slots in our Spearhead catalog.\n\nCan I reactivate free spins in Eastern Mystery?\n\nYou can get 5 additional FS, but only if you land on 3 or more Eastern Mystery symbols during the Free Spins feature.\n            ",

And one of the most fantastic features of this game has to be the Free Spins function - activated when three or more Eastern Mystery logo symbols appear on the reels.</p><p>Once you've entered the Free Spins round, you'll discover that the red and blue jewel symbols take on a new significance. The red jewels represent all symbols - that is, except for the ever-important Eastern Mystery icon - making it easier than ever to score a winning combination.</p><p>But the real fun comes courtesy of the blue jewels. When these symbols appear on winning paylines, they can trigger exciting multipliers that increase your chances of hitting the jackpot. For example, if a blue jewel substitutes on reel 2, you'll get a 1x or 2x multiplier on your winning payline. But if it appears on reel 4, your multiplier can increase all the way up to 1x or 5x. That means the highest combination of multipliers can produce a 10x win - now that's what we call a jackpot winner!</p><p>And if you think that's exciting, just wait - there's more! If three or more Eastern Mystery game symbols appear during the Free Spins round, you'll have a chance to reactivate the game and enjoy five more free spins. It's an adrenaline-packed ride that's full of twists and turns, and we guarantee you won't be able to get enough!</p>\"\n}"
