Con la funzione speciale Avalanche, le righe possono espandersi fino a 8 per darti ben 262.144 modi per vincere! C’è anche un Compass Wild che rende selvaggi alcuni simboli, maxi simboli fino a 4×4, un simbolo Revolver che può regalare giri gratis e jolly appiccicosi. L’RTP è del 96,1% e la vincita massima è di 5.000 x puntata per giro.\nFunzione Avalanche\nQuando ottieni una combinazione vincente, tutti i simboli che contribuiscono esplodono e lasciano spazio a nuovi simboli che entrano in gioco. Conosciuta come la funzione valanga, una riga supplementare di simboli viene aggiunta in alto. Le valanghe continue possono portare a 8 file in totale. Con ogni nuova riga, aumenta il numero di modi per vincere:\n\n4 file = 4.096 modi per vincere\n5 file = 15.625 modi per vincere\n6 file = 46.656 modi per vincere\n7 file = 117.649 modi per vincere\n8 righe = 262.144 modi per vincere\n\n(La funzione Avalanche è disponibile in altre slot della serie Gold di ELK Studios come ad esempio la slot online Cygnus).\nFunzionalità Revolver\nI simboli grandi, che possono avere dimensioni fino a 4×4, possono assorbire simboli più piccoli al di sotto di essi. Quando ciò accade, si attiva la funzione . Quando è pieno, il Revolver diventa completamente selvaggio per aumentare il potenziale di vincita.\nFunzione Wild Compass\nCerca il simbolo Wild Compass. Quando i simboli coincidono attraverso la Wild Compass, diventano anche simboli jolly. Quando si raggiunge la riga inferiore, si attiva il simbolo jolly.\nCome si comporta il Bonus Game in Black River Gold?\nCi sono 3 funzioni bonus in Black River Gold. Tutte e 5 le bobine possono contenere pile di simboli potenziati e un simbolo Respin che può atterrare con simboli appiccicosi. Con il bonus game potrai beneficiare di infiniti giri gratuiti e trasformare i simboli in opportunità di vincita maggiore! l numero di giri gratuiti che riceverai dipende dal numero di simboli bonus di attivazione:\n\n3 simboli bonus = 10 giri gratuiti\n4 simboli bonus = 15 giri gratuiti\n5 simboli bonus = 20 giri gratuiti\n6 simboli bonus = 25 giri gratuiti\n\nChe cos’è il livello di sicurezza?\nA partire da 4 file e 4.096 modi per vincere, ogni vittoria aggiunge un’altra riga e più modi per vincere, fino a 8 righe e 262.144 opzioni di vittoria. A differenza del gioco base, il numero di file e le modalità di vittoria non possono che aumentare. Questa funzione è nota come livello di sicurezza.\nSimboli principali di Black River Gold\nCon montagne rocciose sullo sfondo, i rulli sono inseriti in una struttura metallica. C’è una classica colonna sonora occidentale mentre giri le ruote. I simboli includono:\n\nLe carte da gioco A, K, Q e J\nCi sono anche spille, distintivi di sceriffo, bicchieri di whisky e revolver\nIncontrerai anche pietre preziose, pepite d’oro e diamanti.\nKane, il personaggio principale, è il simbolo del valore più alto che restituisce 1,8, 2, 2,5 o 3 volte la puntata per 3, 4, 5 o 6 in combinazione\nLa rosa rossa è il simbolo jolly e sostituisce tutti i simboli tranne i simboli scatter e wild compass.\n\nTutti i simboli possono apparire come simboli MAXI, il che significa che potrai trovarti sulla schermata di gioco simboli Super, Mega ed Epici rispettivamente di dimensioni 2×2, 3×3 e 4×4.\nConclusioni finali sulla slot mobile Black River Gold\nCome avrai modo di constatare, esiste sia una versione desktop che tablet.

Set in the wild west at the beginning of the 20th century, this free slot game features the character Kane, on the hunt for riches. Join him and explore the original extra features to increase his wealth.\n\nMain Features of Black River Gold\n\nWith 6 reels and 4096 ways to win, this wild west-inspired slot game is the fourth game in the ELK Gold series. It's available on all devices from just 20 cents up to a maximum of 100.00€. With the special Avalanche feature, the rows can expand up to 8 to give you a whopping 262,144 ways to win! Plus, there's a Compass Wild that turns some symbols wild, maxi symbols up to 4x4, a Revolver symbol that can award free spins and sticky wilds. The RTP is 96.1%, and the maximum win is 5,000x the bet per spin.\n\nThe Avalanche Feature\n\nWhen you land a winning combination, all the contributing symbols explode and make way for new symbols. Known as the Avalanche feature, an additional row of symbols is added at the top. Continuous avalanches can lead to 8 rows in total. With each new row, the number of ways to win increases:\n\n4 rows = 4,096 ways to win\n5 rows = 15,625 ways to win\n6 rows = 46,656 ways to win\n7 rows = 117,649 ways to win\n8 rows = 262,144 ways to win\n\n(The Avalanche feature is also available in other slots of the ELK Gold series, such as the online slot Cygnus).\n\nRevolver Feature\n\nThe large symbols, which can be up to 4x4, can absorb smaller symbols under them. When this happens, the Revolver feature is activated. When it's full, the Revolver becomes fully wild to increase the win potential.\n\nWild Compass Feature\n\nLook out for the Wild Compass symbol. When the symbols match through the Wild Compass, they also become wild symbols. When you reach the bottom row, the wild symbol is triggered.\n\nHow Does the Bonus Game Work in Black River Gold?\n\nThere are 3 bonus features in Black River Gold. All 5 reels can contain stacks of enhanced symbols and a Respin symbol that can land with sticky symbols. With the bonus game, you can enjoy endless free spins and transform symbols into bigger win opportunities! The number of free spins you'll receive depends on the number of activation bonus symbols:\n\n3 bonus symbols = 10 free spins\n4 bonus symbols = 15 free spins\n5 bonus symbols = 20 free spins\n6 bonus symbols = 25 free spins\n\nWhat Is the Safety Level?\n\nStarting from 4 rows and 4,096 ways to win, every win adds another row and more ways to win, up to 8 rows and 262,144 ways of potential win. Unlike the base game, the number of rows and ways to win can only increase. This feature is known as the safety level.\n\nMain Symbols of Black River Gold\n\nWith rocky mountains in the background, the reels are set in a metal structure. There's a classic western soundtrack while you spin the reels. The symbols include:\n\nThe A, K, Q, and J playing cards\nThere are also sheriff badges, whiskey glasses, and revolvers\nYou'll also encounter precious stones, gold nuggets, and diamonds.\nKane, the main character, is the highest-paying symbol that returns 1.8, 2, 2.5, or 3 times the bet for 3, 4, 5, or 6 in combination\nThe red rose is the wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the scatter and Wild Compass symbols.\n\nAll symbols can appear as MAXI symbols, which means that you can see Super, Mega, and Epic symbols respectively sized 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 on the screen.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Black River Gold Mobile Slot\n\nAs you can see, there's both a desktop and tablet version available. This is because ELK Studios produces all its games with HTML5 technology, primarily focusing on mobile gameplay. In terms of gameplay, I found it similar to other series in the Gold series, but with extras added to the Revolver feature, the Wild Compass feature, and the characteristic sticky wilds that make Black River Gold a unique game. It's another great product from ELK Studios, although titles like NetEnt's Dead or Alive II and Nolimit City's Deadwood provide greater opportunities in terms of gameplay and maximum win potential!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Black River Gold\n\nWhat is the maximum win of the Black River Gold slot?\n\nThe maximum win for one spin or free spin in the Black River Gold slot game is 5,000 times the total bet. To achieve this goal, you must play with the added rows and ways to win. The Avalanche feature can give you 8 rows with 262,144 ways to win. In the Bonus Game feature, the number of rows/ways to win can only increase, adding further chances to win 5,000 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the free slot game Black River Gold?\n\nThe Black River Gold RTP is 96.1%. With the average RTP of an ELK Studios slot, you'll get an average return of 96.10€ for every 100€ spent. The hit frequency is 24.1%, meaning that nearly 1 in 4 spins will result in a winning combination. With every win, the number of rows and ways to win increases, up to 8 rows and 262,144 potential win options.\n\nIs there a mobile version of the Black River Gold slot?\n\nCertainly! ELK Studios is a mobile-first slot provider, meaning that they create their online slots with mobile gaming in mind. Black River Gold can also be played on desktop and tablet devices. Try it out for free in one of our ADM-licensed casinos!\n            ",

The symbols include:\n\nThe A, K, Q, and J playing cards\nThere are also sheriff badges, whiskey glasses, and revolvers\nYou'll also encounter precious stones, gold nuggets, and diamonds.\nKane, the main character, is the highest-paying symbol that returns 1.8, 2, 2.5, or 3 times the bet for 3, 4, 5, or 6 in combination\nThe red rose is the wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the scatter and Wild Compass symbols.\n\nAll symbols can appear as MAXI symbols, which means that you can see Super, Mega, and Epic symbols respectively sized 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 on the screen.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Black River Gold Mobile Slot\n\nAs you can see, there's both a desktop and tablet version available. This is because ELK Studios produces all its games with HTML5 technology, primarily focusing on mobile gameplay. In terms of gameplay, I found it similar to other series in the Gold series, but with extras added to the Revolver feature, the Wild Compass feature, and the characteristic sticky wilds that make Black River Gold a unique game. It's another great product from ELK Studios, although titles like NetEnt's Dead or Alive II and Nolimit City's Deadwood provide greater opportunities in terms of gameplay and maximum win potential!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Black River Gold\n\nWhat is the maximum win of the Black River Gold slot?\n\nThe maximum win for one spin or free spin in the Black River Gold slot game is 5,000 times the total bet.

In the Bonus Game feature, the number of rows/ways to win can only increase, adding further chances to win 5,000 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the free slot game Black River Gold?\n\nThe Black River Gold RTP is 96.1%. With the average RTP of an ELK Studios slot, you'll get an average return of 96.10€ for every 100€ spent.

The red rose also serves as the Wild symbol, substituting all other symbol icons to increase winning chances.\n\nNumber of reels and paylines\n\nBlack River Gold offers 6 reels with 4096 ways to win. The Avalanche feature expands rows and can create over 262,000 ways to win with eight rows.

Set in the wild west at the beginning of the 20th century, this free slot game features the character Kane, on the hunt for riches. Join him and explore the original extra features to increase his wealth.\n\nMain Features of Black River Gold\n\nWith 6 reels and 4096 ways to win, this wild west-inspired slot game is the fourth game in the ELK Gold series. It's available on all devices from just 20 cents up to a maximum of 100.00€. With the special Avalanche feature, the rows can expand up to 8 to give you a whopping 262,144 ways to win! Plus, there's a Compass Wild that turns some symbols wild, maxi symbols up to 4x4, a Revolver symbol that can award free spins and sticky wilds. The RTP is 96.1%, and the maximum win is 5,000x the bet per spin.\n\nThe Avalanche Feature\n\nWhen you land a winning combination, all the contributing symbols explode and make way for new symbols. Known as the Avalanche feature, an additional row of symbols is added at the top. Continuous avalanches can lead to 8 rows in total. With each new row, the number of ways to win increases:\n\n4 rows = 4,096 ways to win\n5 rows = 15,625 ways to win\n6 rows = 46,656 ways to win\n7 rows = 117,649 ways to win\n8 rows = 262,144 ways to win\n\n(The Avalanche feature is also available in other slots of the ELK Gold series, such as the online slot Cygnus).\n\nRevolver Feature\n\nThe large symbols, which can be up to 4x4, can absorb smaller symbols under them. When this happens, the Revolver feature is activated. When it's full, the Revolver becomes fully wild to increase the win potential.\n\nWild Compass Feature\n\nLook out for the Wild Compass symbol. When the symbols match through the Wild Compass, they also become wild symbols. When you reach the bottom row, the wild symbol is triggered.\n\nHow Does the Bonus Game Work in Black River Gold?\n\nThere are 3 bonus features in Black River Gold. All 5 reels can contain stacks of enhanced symbols and a Respin symbol that can land with sticky symbols. With the bonus game, you can enjoy endless free spins and transform symbols into bigger win opportunities! The number of free spins you'll receive depends on the number of activation bonus symbols:\n\n3 bonus symbols = 10 free spins\n4 bonus symbols = 15 free spins\n5 bonus symbols = 20 free spins\n6 bonus symbols = 25 free spins\n\nWhat Is the Safety Level?\n\nStarting from 4 rows and 4,096 ways to win, every win adds another row and more ways to win, up to 8 rows and 262,144 ways of potential win. Unlike the base game, the number of rows and ways to win can only increase. This feature is known as the safety level.\n\nMain Symbols of Black River Gold\n\nWith rocky mountains in the background, the reels are set in a metal structure. There's a classic western soundtrack while you spin the reels. The symbols include:\n\nThe A, K, Q, and J playing cards\nThere are also sheriff badges, whiskey glasses, and revolvers\nYou'll also encounter precious stones, gold nuggets, and diamonds.\nKane, the main character, is the highest-paying symbol that returns 1.8, 2, 2.5, or 3 times the bet for 3, 4, 5, or 6 in combination\nThe red rose is the wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the scatter and Wild Compass symbols.\n\nAll symbols can appear as MAXI symbols, which means that you can see Super, Mega, and Epic symbols respectively sized 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 on the screen.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Black River Gold Mobile Slot\n\nAs you can see, there's both a desktop and tablet version available. This is because ELK Studios produces all its games with HTML5 technology, primarily focusing on mobile gameplay. In terms of gameplay, I found it similar to other series in the Gold series, but with extras added to the Revolver feature, the Wild Compass feature, and the characteristic sticky wilds that make Black River Gold a unique game. It's another great product from ELK Studios, although titles like NetEnt's Dead or Alive II and Nolimit City's Deadwood provide greater opportunities in terms of gameplay and maximum win potential!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Black River Gold\n\nWhat is the maximum win of the Black River Gold slot?\n\nThe maximum win for one spin or free spin in the Black River Gold slot game is 5,000 times the total bet. To achieve this goal, you must play with the added rows and ways to win. The Avalanche feature can give you 8 rows with 262,144 ways to win. In the Bonus Game feature, the number of rows/ways to win can only increase, adding further chances to win 5,000 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the free slot game Black River Gold?\n\nThe Black River Gold RTP is 96.1%. With the average RTP of an ELK Studios slot, you'll get an average return of 96.10€ for every 100€ spent. The hit frequency is 24.1%, meaning that nearly 1 in 4 spins will result in a winning combination. With every win, the number of rows and ways to win increases, up to 8 rows and 262,144 potential win options.\n\nIs there a mobile version of the Black River Gold slot?\n\nCertainly! ELK Studios is a mobile-first slot provider, meaning that they create their online slots with mobile gaming in mind. Black River Gold can also be played on desktop and tablet devices. Try it out for free in one of our ADM-licensed casinos!\n            ",

Set in the wild west at the beginning of the 20th century, this free slot game features the character Kane, on the hunt for riches. Join him and explore the original extra features to increase his wealth.\n\nMain Features of Black River Gold\n\nWith 6 reels and 4096 ways to win, this wild west-inspired slot game is the fourth game in the ELK Gold series. It's available on all devices from just 20 cents up to a maximum of 100.00€. With the special Avalanche feature, the rows can expand up to 8 to give you a whopping 262,144 ways to win! Plus, there's a Compass Wild that turns some symbols wild, maxi symbols up to 4x4, a Revolver symbol that can award free spins and sticky wilds. The RTP is 96.1%, and the maximum win is 5,000x the bet per spin.\n\nThe Avalanche Feature\n\nWhen you land a winning combination, all the contributing symbols explode and make way for new symbols. Known as the Avalanche feature, an additional row of symbols is added at the top. Continuous avalanches can lead to 8 rows in total. With each new row, the number of ways to win increases:\n\n4 rows = 4,096 ways to win\n5 rows = 15,625 ways to win\n6 rows = 46,656 ways to win\n7 rows = 117,649 ways to win\n8 rows = 262,144 ways to win\n\n(The Avalanche feature is also available in other slots of the ELK Gold series, such as the online slot Cygnus).\n\nRevolver Feature\n\nThe large symbols, which can be up to 4x4, can absorb smaller symbols under them. When this happens, the Revolver feature is activated. When it's full, the Revolver becomes fully wild to increase the win potential.\n\nWild Compass Feature\n\nLook out for the Wild Compass symbol. When the symbols match through the Wild Compass, they also become wild symbols. When you reach the bottom row, the wild symbol is triggered.\n\nHow Does the Bonus Game Work in Black River Gold?\n\nThere are 3 bonus features in Black River Gold. All 5 reels can contain stacks of enhanced symbols and a Respin symbol that can land with sticky symbols. With the bonus game, you can enjoy endless free spins and transform symbols into bigger win opportunities! The number of free spins you'll receive depends on the number of activation bonus symbols:\n\n3 bonus symbols = 10 free spins\n4 bonus symbols = 15 free spins\n5 bonus symbols = 20 free spins\n6 bonus symbols = 25 free spins\n\nWhat Is the Safety Level?\n\nStarting from 4 rows and 4,096 ways to win, every win adds another row and more ways to win, up to 8 rows and 262,144 ways of potential win. Unlike the base game, the number of rows and ways to win can only increase. This feature is known as the safety level.\n\nMain Symbols of Black River Gold\n\nWith rocky mountains in the background, the reels are set in a metal structure. There's a classic western soundtrack while you spin the reels. The symbols include:\n\nThe A, K, Q, and J playing cards\nThere are also sheriff badges, whiskey glasses, and revolvers\nYou'll also encounter precious stones, gold nuggets, and diamonds.\nKane, the main character, is the highest-paying symbol that returns 1.8, 2, 2.5, or 3 times the bet for 3, 4, 5, or 6 in combination\nThe red rose is the wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the scatter and Wild Compass symbols.\n\nAll symbols can appear as MAXI symbols, which means that you can see Super, Mega, and Epic symbols respectively sized 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 on the screen.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Black River Gold Mobile Slot\n\nAs you can see, there's both a desktop and tablet version available. This is because ELK Studios produces all its games with HTML5 technology, primarily focusing on mobile gameplay. In terms of gameplay, I found it similar to other series in the Gold series, but with extras added to the Revolver feature, the Wild Compass feature, and the characteristic sticky wilds that make Black River Gold a unique game. It's another great product from ELK Studios, although titles like NetEnt's Dead or Alive II and Nolimit City's Deadwood provide greater opportunities in terms of gameplay and maximum win potential!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Black River Gold\n\nWhat is the maximum win of the Black River Gold slot?\n\nThe maximum win for one spin or free spin in the Black River Gold slot game is 5,000 times the total bet. To achieve this goal, you must play with the added rows and ways to win. The Avalanche feature can give you 8 rows with 262,144 ways to win. In the Bonus Game feature, the number of rows/ways to win can only increase, adding further chances to win 5,000 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the RTP of the free slot game Black River Gold?\n\nThe Black River Gold RTP is 96.1%. With the average RTP of an ELK Studios slot, you'll get an average return of 96.10€ for every 100€ spent. The hit frequency is 24.1%, meaning that nearly 1 in 4 spins will result in a winning combination. With every win, the number of rows and ways to win increases, up to 8 rows and 262,144 potential win options.\n\nIs there a mobile version of the Black River Gold slot?\n\nCertainly! ELK Studios is a mobile-first slot provider, meaning that they create their online slots with mobile gaming in mind. Black River Gold can also be played on desktop and tablet devices. Try it out for free in one of our ADM-licensed casinos!\n        ",
