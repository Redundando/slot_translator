Additionally, with 2 extra features, you can get an instant bonus round and increase the chances of activating it. Add to all this the Yo Ho Ho Free Spins and your winnings will multiply in no time.\n\nGameplay of Boom Pirates Wonderways\n\nThe five reels of this video slot with four rows and 1,024 ways to win as the default setting can increase up to nine, with six rows and 10,077,696 ways through the innovative new Wonderways reel mechanics. Wins are paid from three to six matching symbols only on adjacent reels from left to right. Join the pirates on desktop or mobile device from 0.20 to 50 credits per spin.

Graphics, animation, and sound combine to create an intense atmosphere and a gaming experience so realistic that it will make you feel like part of the pirate crew.\n\nSymbolism of Boom Pirates\n\nThe island they are about to plunder is visible in the background of the game window, built with wooden planks. The grey stone icons with a skull cover the inactive positions of the reel. The ship being anchored offshore indicates that the pirates are ready to land. The scenery changes from daylight to night as the pirates make their way through the village. As soon as you activate the game, you will find the real cards from 10 to A at the bottom of the paytable. Hitting five or nine on the reels will pay out respectively from 1.2 to 5 times and from 7.5 to 25 times your bet. Among the present icons stand out:\n\nBarrels of gunpowder\nCannons\nParrots\nThe first officer Ben\nThe seductive Captain Mary.\n\nHow to activate the Yo Ho Ho Buy Bonus Feature\n\nIn this online slot game with no registration, there are no wild symbols, but thanks to a fun scatter combination, free spins will be activated on reels one, three, and five shouting the pirate battle cry: \"Yo Ho Ho\". This feature can be activated on any spin in the base game and will cost you 50% in addition to your default bet: for example, a spin with 3.00 credits will increase to 4.00. You can also opt for a shortcut for the Yo Ho Ho Free Spins by clicking on the orange gift box in the control area to activate the \"Buy Feature\" option. It will cost you 100 times your default bet and take you straight to the Free Spins. Get ready for the main reel treasure hunt when you land the three scatter symbols that make up \"YO HO HO\" on reels one, three, and five in one spin or buy the function. The game will trigger 10 Yo Ho Ho Free Spins, which cannot be reactivated as such, but hitting three scatter symbols again during the function will assign +5 free spins, with no limits.\n\nWhat are the other two extra functions of Boom Pirates?\n\nWonderways Reel Extension: this option will be activated randomly in the base game to increase the game window up to the maximum size of 9 × 6 with 10,077,696 per spin. The extra reels and rows are activated only if they contain a winning symbol;\nMary's Swashbuckling Attack: this feature will be activated randomly on a losing spin in the base game.

The game window increases to the maximum size with nine reels and six rows, however, the round will start with the default 5 × 4 format with 1,024 ways while all other positions are covered by skull icons. The ship's cannons can randomly start firing at the beginning of any free spin to uncover a random number of reel positions. The cannon attack can repeat itself until the entire grid with the maximum size of 9 × 6 and 10,077,696 ways has been activated. Any extension will remain active until the end of the free spins.\n\nWhy choose to play Boom Pirates?\n\nFoxium took almost a year from the first announcement to finish the Boom Pirates slot, and looking at the complex mechanics and set-up it is quite understandable. They are a relatively small game studio that usually releases no more than two or three games a year. But it was worth the wait because this slot, which does not require any downloads and can be played both in Demo and with real money, is very fun with many features and optional items that players can use as they please. The potential payout of 3,800 times the bet should satisfy both regular bettors and Pros. Overall, it is truly an extraordinary creation that should be on everyone's wishlist.\n\nSimilar Free Slots to Boom Pirates\n\nIf you love adventure-themed slots about pirates, you may also want to try the following titles, all playable in Demo:\n\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics\n\nBoom Pirates is a five-reel video slot with four rows and 1,024 ways to win, which can be increased up to 10,077,696 ways through the innovative Wonderways reel mechanics. Using the Foxify feature will increase the range from 0.30 to 75 credits. It has medium volatility with an RTP of 96.19%.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nProducing an authentic pirate-themed slot, Foxium has done a great job with the graphics, animation, and sound effects. The wooden planks of the island, the inactive positions of the reel covered with a skull icon, and the ship being anchored offshore create an intense atmosphere. The theme also changes seamlessly from daytime to nighttime as the pirates go through the village, making the player feel like part of the pirate crew.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nBoom Pirates comes loaded with special features and optional items, such as the Wonderways reel extension feature, Mary's swashbuckling attack, and the Yo Ho Ho Free Spins. Additionally, players can opt for a shortcut for the Yo Ho Ho Free Spins by clicking on the orange gift box in the control area to activate the Buy Feature option.\n\nPayouts and RTP\n\nBoom Pirates has medium volatility with an RTP of 96.19%. The potential payout of 3,800 times the bet should satisfy both regular bettors and Pros. Wins are paid from three to six matching symbols only on adjacent reels from left to right. Hitting five or nine on the reels will pay out respectively from 1.2 to 5 times and from 7.5 to 25 times your bet.\n\nBonus Rounds\n\nIn Boom Pirates, the bonus round is activated by landing the three scatter symbols that make up 'YO HO HO' on reels one, three, and five in one spin or by clicking on the Buy Feature option. The Yo Ho Ho Free Spins will trigger, granting players ten free spins, and the game window increases to the maximum size with nine reels and six rows, with potential ways to win up to 10,077,696. Before the start of the function, the scenery changes to a nighttime setting with the ship ready to fire with cannons. The ship's cannons can randomly start firing at the beginning of any free spin to uncover a random number of reel positions.\n\nSound and Music\n\nBoom Pirates has a sound system that nicely complements the graphics and design. Pirates-themed sound effects bring the theme to life with the clatter of ships, cannons firing, and the pirate battle cry: 'Yo Ho Ho'. Additionally, the background music is appropriately thematic and enhances the game's mood.\n\nMobile Optimization\n\nBoom Pirates is playable on desktop computers and mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets. The game can be played using any browser supporting Adobe Flash, and no downloads are required. The game's quality remains the same on different devices, allowing the player to enjoy the same immersive pirate-themed experience on the go.\n\nJackpots\n\nBoom Pirates does not have a progressive jackpot feature. However, the game's potential payout of 3,800 times the bet should satisfy both regular bettors and Pros.\n\nTheme and Storyline\n\nBoom Pirates is all about pirates searching for an island in the high seas for their next treasure hunt. Captain Mary and her band of pirates are on a mission to plunder the island and find hidden treasures. The graphics, animation, and soundtrack combine to create an intense atmosphere and a gaming experience so realistic that it makes you feel like part of the pirate crew.\n\n        \n            ",

Navigate the high seas with Captain Mary and her band of plunderers as they search for an island for their next treasure hunt. Get ready for the attack as they maneuver the ship into port for their round of looting and a booty of winnings up to 3,800 times your bet. Continue reading the details of this incredible pirate-themed slot and make the best winning combinations.\n\nKey features and functionality of Boom Pirates\n\nThanks to the special Wonderways Reel Extension feature, the reels can expand up to 10,077,696 different ways, while Mary swinging casually on a rope will guarantee you a win. Additionally, with 2 extra features, you can get an instant bonus round and increase the chances of activating it. Add to all this the Yo Ho Ho Free Spins and your winnings will multiply in no time.\n\nGameplay of Boom Pirates Wonderways\n\nThe five reels of this video slot with four rows and 1,024 ways to win as the default setting can increase up to nine, with six rows and 10,077,696 ways through the innovative new Wonderways reel mechanics. Wins are paid from three to six matching symbols only on adjacent reels from left to right. Join the pirates on desktop or mobile device from 0.20 to 50 credits per spin. Using the Foxify feature will increase the range from 0.30 to 75 credits. The game has medium volatility with an RTP of 96.19%. Foxium has done a great job producing an authentic pirate-themed slot. Graphics, animation, and sound combine to create an intense atmosphere and a gaming experience so realistic that it will make you feel like part of the pirate crew.\n\nSymbolism of Boom Pirates\n\nThe island they are about to plunder is visible in the background of the game window, built with wooden planks. The grey stone icons with a skull cover the inactive positions of the reel. The ship being anchored offshore indicates that the pirates are ready to land. The scenery changes from daylight to night as the pirates make their way through the village. As soon as you activate the game, you will find the real cards from 10 to A at the bottom of the paytable. Hitting five or nine on the reels will pay out respectively from 1.2 to 5 times and from 7.5 to 25 times your bet. Among the present icons stand out:\n\nBarrels of gunpowder\nCannons\nParrots\nThe first officer Ben\nThe seductive Captain Mary.\n\nHow to activate the Yo Ho Ho Buy Bonus Feature\n\nIn this online slot game with no registration, there are no wild symbols, but thanks to a fun scatter combination, free spins will be activated on reels one, three, and five shouting the pirate battle cry: \"Yo Ho Ho\". This feature can be activated on any spin in the base game and will cost you 50% in addition to your default bet: for example, a spin with 3.00 credits will increase to 4.00. You can also opt for a shortcut for the Yo Ho Ho Free Spins by clicking on the orange gift box in the control area to activate the \"Buy Feature\" option. It will cost you 100 times your default bet and take you straight to the Free Spins. Get ready for the main reel treasure hunt when you land the three scatter symbols that make up \"YO HO HO\" on reels one, three, and five in one spin or buy the function. The game will trigger 10 Yo Ho Ho Free Spins, which cannot be reactivated as such, but hitting three scatter symbols again during the function will assign +5 free spins, with no limits.\n\nWhat are the other two extra functions of Boom Pirates?\n\nWonderways Reel Extension: this option will be activated randomly in the base game to increase the game window up to the maximum size of 9 × 6 with 10,077,696 per spin. The extra reels and rows are activated only if they contain a winning symbol;\nMary's Swashbuckling Attack: this feature will be activated randomly on a losing spin in the base game. Mary will move on a rope to change the symbols for a guaranteed five of a kind.\n\nWhat is the Round Bonus in Boom Pirates?\n\nBefore the start of the function, the scenery changes to a nighttime setting with the ship ready to fire with cannons. The game window increases to the maximum size with nine reels and six rows, however, the round will start with the default 5 × 4 format with 1,024 ways while all other positions are covered by skull icons. The ship's cannons can randomly start firing at the beginning of any free spin to uncover a random number of reel positions. The cannon attack can repeat itself until the entire grid with the maximum size of 9 × 6 and 10,077,696 ways has been activated. Any extension will remain active until the end of the free spins.\n\nWhy choose to play Boom Pirates?\n\nFoxium took almost a year from the first announcement to finish the Boom Pirates slot, and looking at the complex mechanics and set-up it is quite understandable. They are a relatively small game studio that usually releases no more than two or three games a year. But it was worth the wait because this slot, which does not require any downloads and can be played both in Demo and with real money, is very fun with many features and optional items that players can use as they please. The potential payout of 3,800 times the bet should satisfy both regular bettors and Pros. Overall, it is truly an extraordinary creation that should be on everyone's wishlist.\n\nSimilar Free Slots to Boom Pirates\n\nIf you love adventure-themed slots about pirates, you may also want to try the following titles, all playable in Demo:\n\n            ",

Among the present icons stand out:\n\nBarrels of gunpowder\nCannons\nParrots\nThe first officer Ben\nThe seductive Captain Mary.\n\nHow to activate the Yo Ho Ho Buy Bonus Feature\n\nIn this online slot game with no registration, there are no wild symbols, but thanks to a fun scatter combination, free spins will be activated on reels one, three, and five shouting the pirate battle cry: \"Yo Ho Ho\". This feature can be activated on any spin in the base game and will cost you 50% in addition to your default bet: for example, a spin with 3.00 credits will increase to 4.00. You can also opt for a shortcut for the Yo Ho Ho Free Spins by clicking on the orange gift box in the control area to activate the \"Buy Feature\" option. It will cost you 100 times your default bet and take you straight to the Free Spins. Get ready for the main reel treasure hunt when you land the three scatter symbols that make up \"YO HO HO\" on reels one, three, and five in one spin or buy the function. The game will trigger 10 Yo Ho Ho Free Spins, which cannot be reactivated as such, but hitting three scatter symbols again during the function will assign +5 free spins, with no limits.\n\nWhat are the other two extra functions of Boom Pirates?\n\nWonderways Reel Extension: this option will be activated randomly in the base game to increase the game window up to the maximum size of 9 × 6 with 10,077,696 per spin. The extra reels and rows are activated only if they contain a winning symbol;\nMary's Swashbuckling Attack: this feature will be activated randomly on a losing spin in the base game. Mary will move on a rope to change the symbols for a guaranteed five of a kind.\n\nWhat is the Round Bonus in Boom Pirates?\n\nBefore the start of the function, the scenery changes to a nighttime setting with the ship ready to fire with cannons. The game window increases to the maximum size with nine reels and six rows, however, the round will start with the default 5 × 4 format with 1,024 ways while all other positions are covered by skull icons. The ship's cannons can randomly start firing at the beginning of any free spin to uncover a random number of reel positions. The cannon attack can repeat itself until the entire grid with the maximum size of 9 × 6 and 10,077,696 ways has been activated. Any extension will remain active until the end of the free spins.\n\nWhy choose to play Boom Pirates?\n\nFoxium took almost a year from the first announcement to finish the Boom Pirates slot, and looking at the complex mechanics and set-up it is quite understandable. They are a relatively small game studio that usually releases no more than two or three games a year. But it was worth the wait because this slot, which does not require any downloads and can be played both in Demo and with real money, is very fun with many features and optional items that players can use as they please. The potential payout of 3,800 times the bet should satisfy both regular bettors and Pros. Overall, it is truly an extraordinary creation that should be on everyone's wishlist.\n\nSimilar Free Slots to Boom Pirates\n\nIf you love adventure-themed slots about pirates, you may also want to try the following titles, all playable in Demo:\n\n        ",
