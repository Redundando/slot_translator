L’ispirazione è data chiaramente dal romanzo Murder on the Orient Express, scritto nel 1934 da Agatha Christie, in italiano Assassinio sull’Orient Express, che vede come protagonista il celebre detective Hercule Poirot. L’investigatore, che in realtà viaggiava da comune passeggero sul treno, si ritrova suo malgrado a indagare su un omicidio, di cui la vittima è un italiano di nome Cassetti che a sua volta, risulta essere un assassino che scappa dalla giustizia americana.\n\nQuesta slot machine prodotta dalla software house IGT merita di certo un plauso per l’originalità del tema scelto: in un panorama ormai saturo di giochi a tema egiziano e in cui anche le Fruit Machine hanno un po’ stancato, Mystery Express si colloca come un gioco nuovo e originale, una boccata d’aria fresca che non mancherà di coinvolgere e divertire.\nPer quanto riguarda il compartimento grafico, non si tratta di nulla di elaborato, tuttavia le immagini sono riprodotte con grande accuratezza e i personaggi son disegnati in maniera molto realistica, ne consegue quindi un’esperienza di gioco visivamente molto soddisfacente.\n\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nLa struttura base di Mystery Express è quella tradizionale a cinque rulli e tre righe, con 30 linee di pagamento. La cosa che ci ha colpito di più di questa slot è il range di scommesse davvero molto ampio: si parte con un minimo di 0,30 centesimi a giro, per arrivare all’impressionante cifra di 600 €, con un valore del gettone compreso tra 1 centesimo e 20 €. Un range così ampio rende possibili moltissime opzioni di scommessa e Mystery Express risulta pertanto un gioco adatto proprio a tutte le tasche, facendo contenti sia gli scommettitori casuali sia gli high rollers.\nÈ disponibile il gioco in modalità automatica, grazie al quale possono essere impostati fino a 50 giri in Autoplay.\nLa volatilità di Mystery Express è media, mentre il ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP) si attesta su un ottimo 97,03%, di quasi un punto sopra la media.\n\nSimboli e funzionalità di Mystery Express\nL’assassinio sul treno non è molto rilevante ai fini del gameplay, ma aggiunge un tocco di avventura e dramma alla storia. Sullo sfondo si alternano i paesaggi attraversati dal treno, mentre i simboli che troviamo sui rulli di Mystery Express sono interamente tematici e rappresentati da dei gioielli, un orologio da taschino, una bottiglia di whiskey, una fetta di torta servita sul vagone ristorante del treno, una pistola, un uomo e una donna, con questi ultimi che sono i simboli più redditizi tra quelli regolari, pagando un premio pari a 400 volte il valore della puntata per un allineamento di 5.\nInteressante la funzione legata al simbolo Wild, che non solo agisce da jolly ma quando compare su tutti i cinque rulli offre un pagamento di 1.000 volte la puntata.\nInoltre, casualmente può comparire sui rulli un treno che lascia dietro di sé una scia di simboli Wild.

            "response": "Mystery Express: A Thrilling Slot Game for High Rollers\n\nStep into the world of Victorian London aboard a train where a murder has just been committed. This slot game takes its inspiration from Agatha Christie's renowned novel, Murder on the Orient Express, where the famous detective Hercule Poirot investigates the murder of an Italian fugitive. Mystery Express, produced by IGT, deserves applause for its originality in theme, as it presents a refreshing break from the monotonous Egyptian and fruit machine themes that have become commonplace in the world of slot games.\n\nThe graphics are not elaborate, but the characters are realistically drawn, providing a visually satisfying gaming experience. The game features the traditional five reels and three rows structure, with 30 pay lines. However, what is truly impressive about this game is the broad range of bets that it caters to, ranging from a minimum of 0.30 cents per spin to an incredible 600€, with a token value between 1 cent and 20€. With so many betting options, Mystery Express accommodates both casual and high stakes players.\n\nThe game supports an Autoplay mode, allowing the player to set up to 50 spins. The volatility of Mystery Express is average, with an excellent return-to-player rate of 97.03%, almost a point higher than the average.\n\nThe murder on the train adds a touch of adventure and drama to the story, while the symbols on the reels are all thematic, featuring jewelry, a vintage pocket watch, a bottle of whiskey, a slice of cake served on the train's restaurant car, a gun, a man and a woman. The latter two are the most lucrative symbols, paying out 400 times the bet for a lineup of five.\n\nThe Wild symbol acts as a substitute, but when it appears on all five reels, it offers a payout of 1,000 times the bet. Additionally, a train may randomly appear on the reels, leaving behind a trail of wild symbols. Furthermore, there is a Bonus symbol that unlocks the extra dice game, Bon Voyage.\n\nIn summary, Mystery Express is a thrilling and original slot game suitable for both casual and high stakes players, providing a visually satisfying gaming experience while offering excellent payouts and an exciting bonus game.",

The storyline follows the theme of a train ride throughout Victorian London, with players taking on the role of a detective who is solving a murder mystery. Despite the murder mystery being a side plot rather than a major focus, it adds to the overall adventurous appeal of the storyline. The symbols on the reels include a variety of items commonly found on old-style trains, such as jewels, a pocket watch, a whiskey bottle, a slice of cake served in the train's dining car, a gun, and a man and woman. The Wild symbol has the potential to double as a wild card or offer a payout of 1,000 times the stake when it appears on all five reels. The most profitable symbols are the man and woman, aligning them can pay out 400 times the stake.\n\nBetting Range\n\nMystery Express offers a unique feature of a wide betting range. Players can start spinning with a minimum of €0.30 and place bets up to an impressive €600. Gamblers can use up to 30 pay lines and tokens that are valued between €0.01 and €20. This wide range allows for a myriad of betting options, catering to both casual players and high rollers. Mystery Express also offers an automatic mode, where players can set up to 50 spins on Autoplay.\n\nVolatility\n\nThe volatility of Mystery Express is medium, with a return to player (RTP) set at a remarkable 97.03%, which is almost above average. Gamblers that enjoy slots with medium-volatility will find Mystery Express to be an ideal match.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols in this slot game are well-designed, and the graphics are crisp. They include a pocket watch, a whiskey bottle, a slice of cake served on the train's dining car, a gun, and a man and woman. The man and woman are the most profitable symbols when aligned, paying out 400 times the stake. Additionally, the Wild symbol has the potential to double as a wild card or offer a payout of 1,000 times the stake when it appears on all five reels. The game also has a Bonus symbol that unlocks an extra dice game called Bon Voyage.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe Bonus symbol in Mystery Express unlocks Bon Voyage, an extra dice game with a unique train travel theme. In this feature, rolling a dice determines the number of moves up the train track that can lead to exclusive rewards, such as multipliers and free spins. Additionally, a train may randomly appear, leaving a trail of Wild symbols behind and potentially increasing the likelihood of winning combinations.\n\n        \n            ",

It offers a wide betting range starting at €0.30 per spin and going up to €600, with tokens valued between €0.01 and €20. The game has an automatic mode, where up to 50 spins can be set in Autoplay. Its volatility is medium, with an almost above-average return to player (RTP) of 97.03%.\n\nBetting Options and Payout Rate\n\nOne of the most impressive features of Mystery Express is its wide betting range, catering to both casual and high rollers. The game offers a maximum payout of 1,000 times the stake, with an RTP of 97.03%.\n\nSymbol Design and Payout Values\n\nMystery Express features a variety of symbols, including jewels, a pocket watch, a whiskey bottle, a slice of cake served on the train's dining car, a gun, and a man and woman. The woman and man symbols offer the highest payout, at 400 times the stake when aligned. The game also has a Wild symbol that doubles as a wild card and can offer a payout of 1,000 times the stake when appearing on all five reels. Furthermore, a train can randomly appear, leaving a trail of Wild symbols behind.\n\nGame Theme and Story\n\nMystery Express takes place aboard a 19th-century train, where a murder has taken place involving an Italian fugitive from the American justice system. The game draws inspiration from Agatha Christie's novel Murder on the Orient Express, featuring the renowned detective Hercule Poirot as the lead. While the murder mystery is not the main focus of the gameplay, it adds an adventurous and dramatic flair to the story. Against a constantly changing backdrop of train landscapes, players can find symbols related to the train, like whiskey bottles and dining car slices of cake, as well as jewels, guns, and pocket watches.\n\nVisual and Audio Design\n\nWhile Mystery Express may not be the most graphically elaborate slot machine out there, the images are realistically drawn with great accuracy, creating a visually satisfying experience. The game features sounds that are typical of a train journey, like chugging engines and the clicking of train wheels on the tracks. The musical score is upbeat and mysterious, contributing to the game's overall adventurous feel.\n\n        \n            ",

The inspiration is clearly drawn from Agatha Christie’s 1934 novel Murder on the Orient Express, with the renowned Detective Hercule Poirot taking the lead. The investigator, who was actually just a passenger on the train, finds himself solving a murder mystery involving the victim, Cassetti; an Italian fugitive from the American justice system.\n\nProduced by the software house IGT, this slot machine deserves a round of applause for its unique theme. In a saturated market of Egyptian-themed games and even fruit machines, Mystery Express offers a breath of fresh air that is both engaging and entertaining.\nGraphically speaking, it may not be the most elaborate, but the images are realistically drawn with great accuracy. The overall visual experience is extremely satisfying.\n\nKey Features of the slot machine\nMystery Express follows the traditional structure of five reels and three rows with 30 pay lines. One of the most impressive features of this slot machine is the wide betting range: starting from a minimum of €0.30 per spin, players can place bets up to an impressive €600, with tokens valued between €0.01 and €20. This wide range allows for a myriad of betting options, catering to both casual and high rollers.\nMystery Express also offers an automatic mode, where up to 50 spins can be set in Autoplay. Its volatility is medium, with a return to player (RTP) set at a remarkable 97.03%, almost above average.\n\nSymbols and Features of Mystery Express\nThe train murder is not exactly the main focus of the gameplay, but it adds an adventurous and dramatic flair to the story. Against a constantly changing backdrop of train landscapes, symbols on the reels include a variety of jewels, a pocket watch, a whiskey bottle, a slice of cake served on the train's dining car, a gun, and a man and woman, with the latter two being the most profitable symbols when aligned, paying out 400 times the stake. The Wild symbol not only doubles as a wild card but when it appears on all five reels, it offers a payout of 1,000 times the stake.\nOn top of that, a train can randomly appear, leaving a trail of Wild symbols behind. There is also a Bonus symbol that unlocks an extra dice game called Bon Voyage.\n\nTranslated text suitable for experienced gamblers.\n        ",
