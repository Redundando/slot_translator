With nine paylines, gamers can choose to activate one, three, five, seven, or all of them. Players can place a bet on each line starting from one token up to 100 tokens. Banana Splash is an excellent option for beginners who want to learn about online slot games.\n\nGraphics\n\nBanana Splash offers a fun and colorful theme with cartoon-style fruits. The game is set in a beachy atmosphere representing a blue sea. The graphics are reminiscent of old billboards advertising ice cream from the 80s. The game has no special effects or 3D animations, but it still provides pleasing graphics for players to enjoy.\n\nPaylines\n\nBanana Splash has nine paylines, with players having the option to activate one, three, five, seven, or all of them. Players can place a bet on each line starting from one token up to 100 tokens. The minimum bet per spin is 1 token, while the maximum bet is 900 tokens.\n\nSymbols\n\nBanana Splash presents colorful fruit symbols that have been redesigned with summertime beach themes. The slot has six fruit symbols. A pineapple with a lifebuoy, a melon playing bongos, a strawberry doing water skiing, a watermelon sunbathing, an orange with diving gear, and a banana joker symbol. Additionally, there are the numbers and letters referring to playing cards from 9 to Ace. The banana serves as the Wild symbol with a joker function, while the beach cabin is the Scatter symbol.\n\nReturn to Player\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) for Banana Splash stands at 95.79%. This percentage is slightly below average but still an acceptable return for players who enjoy this type of online slot game. With x9 paylines and bonus features triggered by Scatter symbols, Banana Splash provides an overall good gaming experience for players with small budgets.\n\n        \n            ",

Are you nostalgic for the old arcade machines and love seeing colorful fruits on the reels? If you also don't mind 80s graphics and a slightly more modern twist, well then Banana Splash may be the slot machine for you!\n\nProduced by the software house Novomatic, Banana Splash is a kind of 80s fruit machine, with fruits reproduced in cartoon version and the background represented by a blue sea. As for the graphics, Banana Splash reminded us of old billboards advertising ice cream in past decades, both for its colors and the way symbols are reproduced. \n\nWe don't have any special effects that liven up the game nor three-dimensional animations, but overall Banana Splash is a very pleasing slot visually, which promises a fun and cheerful gaming experience.\n\nThe initial screen of this slot machine opens with the image of a smiling banana swimming in the middle of the sea and holding two sacks of money marked with the dollar symbol, while on the reels we find the other fruits also drawn in a summery theme. \n\nMain features of the slot machine\nThis fun slot machine from Novomatic is simple both in terms of graphics and gameplay, which is why we recommend it to players who don't like particularly complex game modes, as well as for beginners, who can learn about the world of slots in a simple and intuitive way. However, if you want to practice a little before investing real money, Novomatic offers Banana Splash in demo version as well, to play and have fun without limits, completely for free! \n\nThe grid of Banana Splash is traditional with five reels and three rows, while there are only nine paylines and you can choose to activate one, three, five, seven, or all of them! \n\nDepending on the budget, on each line you can place bets starting from one token up to 100, for a maximum bet of 900 tokens. \n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of Banana Splash stands at 95.79%, slightly below average but still acceptable.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\nThe symbols that can be found on the reels of Banana Splash are represented by colorful fruits reproduced in beach version, as well as by the numbers and letters referring to playing cards from 9 to Ace. Among the fruits, we have a pineapple swimming with a lifebuoy, a melon playing bongos, a strawberry doing water skiing, a watermelon sunbathing, an orange with a diving mask and fins, and of course the banana, which is also the Wild symbol with a joker function. \n\nThere is also a Scatter symbol, a beach cabin, which can award instant prizes and activate the bonus of free spins if it appears at least three times on the reels.\n            ",

The other symbols from the game, such as a pineapple with a lifebuoy, a melon playing bongos, and a watermelon sunbathing, should be in the background, scattered on the beach.

Are you nostalgic for the old arcade machines and love seeing colorful fruits on the reels? If you also don't mind 80s graphics and a slightly more modern twist, well then Banana Splash may be the slot machine for you!\n\nProduced by the software house Novomatic, Banana Splash is a kind of 80s fruit machine, with fruits reproduced in cartoon version and the background represented by a blue sea. As for the graphics, Banana Splash reminded us of old billboards advertising ice cream in past decades, both for its colors and the way symbols are reproduced. \n\nWe don't have any special effects that liven up the game nor three-dimensional animations, but overall Banana Splash is a very pleasing slot visually, which promises a fun and cheerful gaming experience.\n\nThe initial screen of this slot machine opens with the image of a smiling banana swimming in the middle of the sea and holding two sacks of money marked with the dollar symbol, while on the reels we find the other fruits also drawn in a summery theme. \n\nMain features of the slot machine\nThis fun slot machine from Novomatic is simple both in terms of graphics and gameplay, which is why we recommend it to players who don't like particularly complex game modes, as well as for beginners, who can learn about the world of slots in a simple and intuitive way. However, if you want to practice a little before investing real money, Novomatic offers Banana Splash in demo version as well, to play and have fun without limits, completely for free! \n\nThe grid of Banana Splash is traditional with five reels and three rows, while there are only nine paylines and you can choose to activate one, three, five, seven, or all of them! \n\nDepending on the budget, on each line you can place bets starting from one token up to 100, for a maximum bet of 900 tokens. \n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of Banana Splash stands at 95.79%, slightly below average but still acceptable.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\nThe symbols that can be found on the reels of Banana Splash are represented by colorful fruits reproduced in beach version, as well as by the numbers and letters referring to playing cards from 9 to Ace. Among the fruits, we have a pineapple swimming with a lifebuoy, a melon playing bongos, a strawberry doing water skiing, a watermelon sunbathing, an orange with a diving mask and fins, and of course the banana, which is also the Wild symbol with a joker function. \n\nThere is also a Scatter symbol, a beach cabin, which can award instant prizes and activate the bonus of free spins if it appears at least three times on the reels.\n        ",
