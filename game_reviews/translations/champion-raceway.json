With a horse racing theme, it has 3x multipliers that triple your result - if you get 2 or more on a payline, you can benefit from a 9x multiplier. The pink horse gives you 5 free spins with increasing multipliers from 2x to 10x while the blue horse rewards you with 10 free spins with increasing multipliers from 4x to 13x. Highly volatile, there are wins of over 5,217 times your bet on every free spin! \n\nA traditional look\nChampion Raceway is produced by IGT. It brings you to horse racing and as soon as you load it, you will notice that the screen is divided into two parts. The reels are positioned at the bottom of the screen, while in the upper part you can see five racetracks with five horses that come into play as soon as you start spinning the reels. \n\nWhen it comes to the icons that appear on the reels, the IGT version features all kinds of fruit, including plums, watermelons, lemons, oranges, and grapes. The symbol depicted as the rose garland with a 3x label on it stands for the Wild which will replace all other symbols and the triple wins of the winning combinations in which it is included. \n\nVisually, it's pretty simple and has cartoon-style graphics - it has a 3×3 reel set with a horse race track above the reels. It's not beautiful, but you should overlook this aspect. In terms of symbols, they include classics like lemons, grapes, plums, oranges, and watermelons. You also have 3 3x multipliers - take 3 on a payline to win 10,000 coins (or 400 times your stake). \n\nIf you're a fan of horse racing and like a bet or two, then this Champion Raceway slot is for you, thanks to its simple gameplay and potential for big bonus wins. \n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThere's a lot to do at Champion Raceway for a classic slot and the game certainly offers multiple opportunities to win thanks to its rewarding bonus features that make it exciting. It comes with an RTP ranging from 92.81% to 96.66%, so give it a spin or two and keep an eye on the horses as they are the key to getting bigger wins. \n\nThe top-paying symbol is the Wild, which pays alone and aligning 3 of these across a payline awards the top fixed jackpot of 10,000 coins. The biggest downside to the Champion Raceway slot is the amount assigned by the standard symbols as they pay out 30 coins for a combination of three of a kind each, so for the most lucrative prizes, you have to rely on multipliers. When it comes to graphics, there's nothing special about them, and yet they serve the game theme well, and the same goes for the soundtrack. \n\nIf you win 5 free games, the first two spins will be played with multipliers ranging from 2x to 5x, the free spin wins 3 and 4 will be subject to multipliers from 4x to 7x while the last spin can come with a multiplier from 10x to 13x. During the feature triggered by the blue horse, you will benefit from a multiplier between 4x and 7x for the first 4 free games, free spins 5, 6, 7, and 8 are subject to multipliers between 6x and 10x while for free spins 9 and 10, your winnings can be increased by 10x up to 13x.

The pink horse gives you 5 free spins with increasing multipliers from 2x to 10x while the blue horse rewards you with 10 free spins with increasing multipliers from 4x to 13x. Highly volatile, there are wins of over 5,217 times your bet on every free spin! \n\nA traditional look\nChampion Raceway is produced by IGT. It brings you to horse racing and as soon as you load it, you will notice that the screen is divided into two parts. The reels are positioned at the bottom of the screen, while in the upper part you can see five racetracks with five horses that come into play as soon as you start spinning the reels. \n\nWhen it comes to the icons that appear on the reels, the IGT version features all kinds of fruit, including plums, watermelons, lemons, oranges, and grapes. The symbol depicted as the rose garland with a 3x label on it stands for the Wild which will replace all other symbols and the triple wins of the winning combinations in which it is included. \n\nVisually, it's pretty simple and has cartoon-style graphics - it has a 3×3 reel set with a horse race track above the reels. It's not beautiful, but you should overlook this aspect. In terms of symbols, they include classics like lemons, grapes, plums, oranges, and watermelons. You also have 3 3x multipliers - take 3 on a payline to win 10,000 coins (or 400 times your stake). \n\nIf you're a fan of horse racing and like a bet or two, then this Champion Raceway slot is for you, thanks to its simple gameplay and potential for big bonus wins. \n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThere's a lot to do at Champion Raceway for a classic slot and the game certainly offers multiple opportunities to win thanks to its rewarding bonus features that make it exciting. It comes with an RTP ranging from 92.81% to 96.66%, so give it a spin or two and keep an eye on the horses as they are the key to getting bigger wins. \n\nThe top-paying symbol is the Wild, which pays alone and aligning 3 of these across a payline awards the top fixed jackpot of 10,000 coins. The biggest downside to the Champion Raceway slot is the amount assigned by the standard symbols as they pay out 30 coins for a combination of three of a kind each, so for the most lucrative prizes, you have to rely on multipliers. When it comes to graphics, there's nothing special about them, and yet they serve the game theme well, and the same goes for the soundtrack. \n\nIf you win 5 free games, the first two spins will be played with multipliers ranging from 2x to 5x, the free spin wins 3 and 4 will be subject to multipliers from 4x to 7x while the last spin can come with a multiplier from 10x to 13x. During the feature triggered by the blue horse, you will benefit from a multiplier between 4x and 7x for the first 4 free games, free spins 5, 6, 7, and 8 are subject to multipliers between 6x and 10x while for free spins 9 and 10, your winnings can be increased by 10x up to 13x. In addition, if two horses finish the race at the same time, the winner will be chosen at random. \n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you're a horse enthusiast and can't wait to go to the racetrack every Sunday, we can also suggest Horse Racing Slot.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay Features\nBonus Features\nGraphics and Design\nPayout Potential\nTheme and Atmosphere\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Champion Raceway is a 3-reel, 5-payline slot game from IGT that can be played from 25p per spin on all devices. With a horse racing theme, it has 3x multipliers that triple your result - if you get 2 or more on a payline, you can benefit from a 9x multiplier. The pink horse gives you 5 free spins with increasing multipliers from 2x to 10x while the blue horse rewards you with 10 free spins with increasing multipliers from 4x to 13x. Highly volatile, there are wins of over 5,217 times your bet on every free spin! \n\nA traditional look\nChampion Raceway is produced by IGT. It brings you to horse racing and as soon as you load it, you will notice that the screen is divided into two parts. The reels are positioned at the bottom of the screen, while in the upper part you can see five racetracks with five horses that come into play as soon as you start spinning the reels. \n\nWhen it comes to the icons that appear on the reels, the IGT version features all kinds of fruit, including plums, watermelons, lemons, oranges, and grapes. The symbol depicted as the rose garland with a 3x label on it stands for the Wild which will replace all other symbols and the triple wins of the winning combinations in which it is included. \n\nVisually, it's pretty simple and has cartoon-style graphics - it has a 3×3 reel set with a horse race track above the reels. It's not beautiful, but you should overlook this aspect. In terms of symbols, they include classics like lemons, grapes, plums, oranges, and watermelons. You also have 3 3x multipliers - take 3 on a payline to win 10,000 coins (or 400 times your stake). \n\nIf you're a fan of horse racing and like a bet or two, then this Champion Raceway slot is for you, thanks to its simple gameplay and potential for big bonus wins. \n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThere's a lot to do at Champion Raceway for a classic slot and the game certainly offers multiple opportunities to win thanks to its rewarding bonus features that make it exciting. It comes with an RTP ranging from 92.81% to 96.66%, so give it a spin or two and keep an eye on the horses as they are the key to getting bigger wins. \n\nThe top-paying symbol is the Wild, which pays alone and aligning 3 of these across a payline awards the top fixed jackpot of 10,000 coins. The biggest downside to the Champion Raceway slot is the amount assigned by the standard symbols as they pay out 30 coins for a combination of three of a kind each, so for the most lucrative prizes, you have to rely on multipliers. When it comes to graphics, there's nothing special about them, and yet they serve the game theme well, and the same goes for the soundtrack. \n\nIf you win 5 free games, the first two spins will be played with multipliers ranging from 2x to 5x, the free spin wins 3 and 4 will be subject to multipliers from 4x to 7x while the last spin can come with a multiplier from 10x to 13x. During the feature triggered by the blue horse, you will benefit from a multiplier between 4x and 7x for the first 4 free games, free spins 5, 6, 7, and 8 are subject to multipliers between 6x and 10x while for free spins 9 and 10, your winnings can be increased by 10x up to 13x. In addition, if two horses finish the race at the same time, the winner will be chosen at random. \n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you're a horse enthusiast and can't wait to go to the racetrack every Sunday, we can also suggest Horse Racing Slot. Produced by iSoftBet, it guarantees you incredible multipliers that will allow you to get 100 times your bet!\n            ",

Champion Raceway is a game that truly delivers the excitement and thrill of the racetrack. But let's cut to the chase and talk about what matters most to all players: payouts.</p><p>As you might expect, the Wild symbol is your best friend if you want to hit the jackpot. If you're lucky enough to get three Wild symbols on a payline, boom! You'll be laughing all the way to the stable with a hefty top fixed jackpot of 10,000 coins. That's almost enough to buy a real horse!</p><p>The standard symbols, on the other hand, won't make you rich overnight, but still provide decent payouts. Get three lemons, grapes, plums, oranges, or watermelons lined up on a payline, and you'll receive a cool 30 coins. Of course, to win the big bucks, you need to rely on multipliers, but that's a different story.</p><p>Overall, we give Champion Raceway a thumbs up for its symbol payouts. It's not the most generous game out there, but hitting the jackpot is still a very achievable goal. So, what are you waiting for? Giddy up and try your luck!</p>\"\n}"

Wow, that's a lot of coins! If Lady Luck is on your side, you could be walking away with big bucks.</p>\n\n  <p>Of course, the standard symbols in the game also provide reasonable payouts. Three of a kind of any standard symbol will pay out 30 coins. But let's face it - we're not here for reasonable payouts. We want to win big, and in Champion Raceway's case, that can only be achieved with the use of multipliers. These multipliers provide players with the necessary boost to snag the game's top-notch rewards.</p>\n\n  <p>When it comes to the game's RTP, Champion Raceway ranks well, with rates that range from 92.81% to 96.66%. However, winning big really comes down to leveraging the game's bonus features. Take the Victory Lap Bonus, for example, where players pick a horse to race. To increase the excitement, the horses receive multipliers as the race progresses - your chosen horse could go from a 2x to an 8x multiplier in a single lap!</p>\n\n  <p>All in all, Champion Raceway is a game that has definitely caught our attention. With its impressive payout potential and fun, horse-racing theme, it's a slot game that players won't want to miss. So, buckle up, place your bets and let's see which horse comes out on top!</p>"

In this area, Champion Raceway does not disappoint. The game boasts a Wild symbol that pays out an impressive 10,000 coins when players align three of them across a payline. Wow, that's a lot of coins! If Lady Luck is on your side, you could be walking away with big bucks.</p>\n\n  <p>Of course, the standard symbols in the game also provide reasonable payouts. Three of a kind of any standard symbol will pay out 30 coins. But let's face it - we're not here for reasonable payouts. We want to win big, and in Champion Raceway's case, that can only be achieved with the use of multipliers. These multipliers provide players with the necessary boost to snag the game's top-notch rewards.</p>\n\n  <p>When it comes to the game's RTP, Champion Raceway ranks well, with rates that range from 92.81% to 96.66%. However, winning big really comes down to leveraging the game's bonus features. Take the Victory Lap Bonus, for example, where players pick a horse to race. To increase the excitement, the horses receive multipliers as the race progresses - your chosen horse could go from a 2x to an 8x multiplier in a single lap!</p>\n\n  <p>All in all, Champion Raceway is a game that has definitely caught our attention. With its impressive payout potential and fun, horse-racing theme, it's a slot game that players won't want to miss. So, buckle up, place your bets and let's see which horse comes out on top!</p>\"\n}"

The game has a horse racing theme, and the screen is divided into two parts, with the reels positioned at the bottom of the screen and five racetracks with horses in the upper part. The symbols on the reels include all kinds of fruit, with the rose garland symbol acting as the Wild, replacing all others and tripling the wins of any winning combination in which it appears.\n\nMultiplier System\n\nChampion Raceway has a unique multiplier system that can triple your winnings. If you get two or more 3x multiplier symbols on a payline, you can benefit from a 9x multiplier. There are also 3 3x multipliers, and landing 3 of them on a payline can win you up to 10,000 coins (or 400 times your stake).\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nChampion Raceway offers two different free spins features, both with increasing multipliers. Landing the pink horse symbol awards you with 5 free spins with multipliers ranging from 2x to 10x, while landing the blue horse symbol wins you 10 free spins with multipliers ranging from 4x to 13x. During the first two spins of the pink horse feature, the multipliers range from 2x to 5x, the following two spins offer multipliers from 4x to 7x, and the last spin comes with a multiplier from 10x to 13x. Similarly, during the blue horse feature, the first four free games come with multipliers of 4x to 7x, the next four free spins have multipliers of 6x to 10x, and the final two free spins offer multipliers of 10x to 13x.\n\nSymbol Payouts\n\nThe Wild symbol is the top-paying symbol in Champion Raceway, offering the top fixed jackpot of 10,000 coins if you align three of them across a payline. The standard symbols pay out 30 coins for a combination of three of a kind each, so to win the most lucrative prizes, you have to rely on multipliers. The symbols include classics like lemons, grapes, plums, oranges, and watermelons.\n\nGraphics and Theme\n\nChampion Raceway has a simple, cartoon-style graphics and a 3x3 reel set with a horse race track above the reels. Although not the most beautiful game out there, it serves its horse racing theme well. The soundtrack is also fitting for the theme. If you're a fan of horse racing and enjoy placing bets, this slot game may be worth a try for its simple gameplay and potential for big bonus wins. \n\n        \n            ",

With a horse racing theme, it has 3x multipliers that triple your result - if you get 2 or more on a payline, you can benefit from a 9x multiplier. The pink horse gives you 5 free spins with increasing multipliers from 2x to 10x while the blue horse rewards you with 10 free spins with increasing multipliers from 4x to 13x. Highly volatile, there are wins of over 5,217 times your bet on every free spin! \n\nA traditional look\nChampion Raceway is produced by IGT. It brings you to horse racing and as soon as you load it, you will notice that the screen is divided into two parts. The reels are positioned at the bottom of the screen, while in the upper part you can see five racetracks with five horses that come into play as soon as you start spinning the reels. \n\nWhen it comes to the icons that appear on the reels, the IGT version features all kinds of fruit, including plums, watermelons, lemons, oranges, and grapes. The symbol depicted as the rose garland with a 3x label on it stands for the Wild which will replace all other symbols and the triple wins of the winning combinations in which it is included. \n\nVisually, it's pretty simple and has cartoon-style graphics - it has a 3×3 reel set with a horse race track above the reels. It's not beautiful, but you should overlook this aspect. In terms of symbols, they include classics like lemons, grapes, plums, oranges, and watermelons.
