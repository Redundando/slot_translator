In questo modo la scommessa aumenta di 1,5x o 2x, rispettivamente. RTP è anche dipendente dalla fila, il che significa che 3, 4 o 5 righe in gioco producono rispettivamente una valutazione del 96,01%, 96,07% o 96,19%.\nIn tutti i casi, la volatilità rimane la stessa – 10/10, o, se vogliamo l’esempio con le classi di Nolimit, è “Estrema”.\nLe regole fondamentali sono piuttosto standard.

Simile alla funzione Hyperspins di Microgaming, i giocatori possono bloccare le bobine in posizione per una scommessa regolata. Disponibile dopo ogni giro di gioco principale, i giocatori possono bloccare fino a 4 rulli in posizione. Il costo dipende dal mulinello, dal tipo di simbolo sui rulli e così via.

            "response": "Book of Shadows is an eerie and incredibly volatile horror-themed slot game by Nolimit City. You have the option to choose whether to play on a 3, 4, or 5 reel machine that offers paylines ranging from 10 to 15 and 20. For a fee, you can also choose to Lock the Reels, which can be useful if you land two Scatters but miss the third to activate the Free Spins feature. This feature rewards you with free spins that come complete with a special expanding symbol. With a potential payout of 30,338x your bet, we can't wait to reveal the mysteries of Book of Shadows in our review. \n\nPlayable on any device, from 10 cents to €100 per spin, Book of Shadows offers an RTP rating of 96.01%, 96.07%, or 96.19%, depending on the number of rows you choose to play with. Despite the variation in rows, the volatility rating remains the same throughout and can be described as \"Extreme\".\n\nThe basic rules of the game are fairly standard. Match symbols from left to right starting from the first reel to win. As you can imagine, more rows mean more paylines, so 3, 4, or 5 rows provide 10, 15, or 20 Shadow Rows, as they are called.\n\nWith its obvious horror theme, Book of Shadows is genuinely chilling. Unlike some horror-themed cartoon slots that play it for laughs like Scooby Doo, there is a far more unsettling atmosphere to Book of Shadows. \n\nThe slot revolves around the Book of Spells, which according to Nolimit City can alter the reality of the \"reel\" world. It appears to be inspired by the Book of Shadows which holds religious texts and instructions for magical rituals. Regardless, the design here is simple but creates a decidedly eerie atmosphere. \n\nWith a forest at night in the background, the reels feature symbols from bloody red A's to real-life numbers alongside an eye in a flask, a butterfly, an animal skull, and a cat. The mysterious woman is the highest paying standard symbol, awarding 1, 2, 10, or 500x your bet if you land 2, 3, 4, or 5 on a payline. The Book of Shadows symbol acts as both a wild and a scatter and offers the same payout amounts.\n\nProduced using HTML5 technology, Book of Shadows is playable on desktops, mobiles, and tablets alike. The images and animations work well even on smaller screens.\n\nFree spins with expanding symbols remain the most desirable feature here, but there are a couple of extra features, including Lucky Locks, Gamble 50/50, and the Bonus Wheel. \n\nLet's first discuss Lucky Locks. Similar to Microgaming's Hyperspins feature, players can lock the reels in position for an adjusted wager. This feature becomes available after every main game spin, and players can lock up to 4 reels in position. The cost depends on the reel, the type of symbol on the reels, and so on. You can lock two scatters and respin the rest in the hope of landing the third if you wish. \n\nNo 'Book of' slot is complete without the option of gambling your winnings. The 50/50 gamble feature is available after free spins or base game wins. It's a simple choice of red or black cards that will either double or not double your money. You can play up to five consecutive bets, as long as the winnings amount is less than €500,000. \n\nThe Bonus Wheel allows you to bet for the chance to win free spins, as long as the win does not exceed 60x the bet. A highlighted segment on a wheel spins, and the size depends on the amount of your win. Land on the segment to collect 10 free spins at the current row height. \n\nIt all boils down to the free spins game, which is triggered by landing 3 or more Book symbols in view. 3 scatters award 10 free spins at the current row height, but you can increase or decrease the number of rows to receive more or fewer free spins.\n\nBefore the spin begins, a golden symbol is chosen randomly. If you are not satisfied with it, you can reshuffle it once in the hope of an upgrade. It can also work the other way around, so be careful. \n\nDuring the free spins, the golden symbols expand to cover full reels after paylines are evaluated. Expanded golden symbols pay all paylines from any position; they do not need to be adjacent. The ultimate result is five goth girls on a 5-row grid for a win of 10,000 times your stake. Additionally, landing 3 or more Book scatters on a free spin retriggers the feature. \n\nThe bonus game is triggered every 154 spins theoretically, but if you can't wait, there is an option to buy the feature. If available in your jurisdiction, the Nolimit bonus, as it is called, costs 60x, 90x, or 120x for 10 free spins with 3, 4, or 5 rows respectively.\n\nSimilar Slot Games\nDeadwood is a 5-reel, 576 ways to win slot game by Nolimit City. Available to play on all devices from 20p per spin, this Wild West-themed slot comes with Hunter xNudge Wilds that expand and increase the multiplier after each hit. There is a Shoot Out feature where low-value symbols act as wilds.",

You can choose to play with 3, 4 or 5 rows, each with 10, 15 or 20 paylines respectively. There is also a feature where you can lock in your reels for a price, which can come in handy if you land 2 scatters but miss the third one to activate the Free Spins feature. This feature rewards you with free spins complete with a special expanding symbol. With a potential win of 30,338 x your bet, we don't know what horrors await you in our Book of Shadows review.\n\nBook of Shadows is playable on any device from 10 cents to €100 per spin. The default setting is 3 rows but you can activate 4 or even 5 rows by clicking on the grid. This increases your bet by 1.5x or 2x, respectively. The RTP also varies based on the number of rows - 3, 4 or 5 rows in play produce RTPs of 96.01%, 96.07% or 96.19%, respectively.\n\nIn any case, the volatility remains the same - 10/10 or, if we go by Nolimit classes, it's \"Extreme\".\n\nThe basic rules are standard. Matching symbols from left to right from the first reel to produce a win. More rows mean more paylines, so 3, 4 or 5 rows provide 10, 15 or 20 Shadow Rows, as they are called.\n\nTruly terrifying graphics\nWith an obvious horror theme, the Book of Shadows slot game is truly frightening. Some horror cartoon slots play it for laughs in the style of Scooby Doo when it comes to design. But there is a much more unsettling feeling in Book of Shadows.\n\nThe slot game focuses on the book of spells, which according to Nolimit City, can alter the \"reel\" world's reality. It seems to be inspired by the book of shadows, which contains religious texts and instructions for magic rituals. In any case, the design here is simple but creates a decidedly chilling atmosphere.\n\nWith a nighttime forest backdrop, the reels include A in bloody red to 10 royal next to an eye in a flask, a butterfly, the skull of an animal, and a cat. The mysterious woman is the standard and most lucrative symbol, paying out 1, 2, 10 or 500 x your bet if you land 2, 3, 4 or 5 on a payline. The Book of Shadows symbol is both the wild and scatter symbol and offers the same payouts.\n\nProduced using HTML5 technology, Book of Shadows can be played on desktop, mobile and tablet devices. The images and animations also work well on smaller screens.\n\nThe slot machine's functions and symbols\nFree spins with expanding symbols remain the most desirable moment in this case, but there are a couple of extra features including Lucky Locks, Gamble 50/50, and the Bonus Wheel.\n\nLet's start with Lucky Locks. Similar to Microgaming's Hyperspins feature, players can lock their reels in place for a set bet. Available after every main game spin, players can lock up to 4 reels in place. The cost depends on the reel, the type of symbol on the reels, and so on. You can lock two scatters and reject the rest in the hopes of landing the third one if you wish.\n\nNo \"Book of\" slot would be complete without the chance to gamble your winnings. The 50/50 gamble feature is available after free spins or base game wins. It's a simple choice of red or black cards that will either double your money or leave it as is. You can play up to five bets in a row as long as the win amount is lower than €500,000.\n\nThe Bonus Wheel allows you to bet for the chance to win free spins - as long as the win doesn't exceed 60x your bet. A wheel with a highlighted segment spins; the size depends on your win amount. Land on the segment to collect 10 free spins at the current row level.\n\nThe ultimate goal is the free spins game, activated by landing 3 or more book symbols in view. 3 scatters award 10 free spins at the current row level, but you can increase or decrease the number of rows to receive more or fewer free spins.\n\nBefore the spin begins, a golden symbol is randomly chosen. If you are not happy with the one offered, you can reshuffle once in the hopes of an upgrade. It can also work the other way around, so be careful.\n\nDuring free spins, golden symbols expand to cover entire reels after the paylines have been evaluated. Expanded golden symbols pay out on all paylines from any position; they don't have to be adjacent. The final result is five goth girls on a 5-row grid for a win of 10,000 times the bet. Additionally, landing 3 or more book scatters on a free spin retriggers the feature.\n\nThe bonus game is activated every 154 spins in theory, but if you can't wait, there's an option to buy the feature. If available in your jurisdiction, the Nolimit bonus, as it's called, costs 60x, 90x, or 120x for 10 free spins with 3, 4, or 5 rows, respectively.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nThe Deadwood slot game is a Wild West themed 5 reel, 576 ways to win game powered by Nolimit City.

Almeno, questo è il costo all’impostazione predefinita di 3 righe. Cliccando sulla griglia, i giocatori possono attivare 4 o anche 5 righe. In questo modo la scommessa aumenta di 1,5x o 2x, rispettivamente. RTP è anche dipendente dalla fila, il che significa che 3, 4 o 5 righe in gioco producono rispettivamente una valutazione del 96,01%, 96,07% o 96,19%.\nIn tutti i casi, la volatilità rimane la stessa – 10/10, o, se vogliamo l’esempio con le classi di Nolimit, è “Estrema”.\nLe regole fondamentali sono piuttosto standard. Simboli di corrispondenza del terreno da sinistra a destra dalla prima bobina per una vittoria. Come potete immaginare, più righe significano più linee di vincita, quindi 3, 4 o 5 righe forniscono 10, 15 o 20 Shadow Rows, come vengono chiamate.\nUna grafica veramente paurosa\nCon un ovvio tema horror, la Slot Machine Book of Shadows è in realtà piuttosto spaventosa. Alcune slot horror dei cartoni animati lo giocano per le risate in stile Scooby Doo quando si tratta di design. C’è una sensazione molto più inquietante in Book of Shadows.\nLa slot si concentra sul libro degli incantesimi che, secondo Nolimit City, può alterare la realtà del mondo “a bobina”. Sembra che si ispiri al libro del Libro delle Ombre, che contiene testi religiosi e istruzioni per i rituali magici. In ogni caso, il design qui è semplice ma crea un’atmosfera decisamente fredda\nCon un bosco di notte sullo sfondo, le bobine includono da A rosso sangue a 10 reali accanto a un occhio in una fiaschetta, una farfalla, il teschio di un animale e un gatto. La donna misteriosa è il simbolo standard più gratificante, pagando 1, 2, 10 o 500 x la tua puntata se atterri 2, 3, 4 o 5 su una linea di pagamento. Gli stessi importi di pagamento sono offerti dal simbolo del Libro delle Ombre, che è sia il simbolo wild che scatter.\nProdotto usando la tecnologia HTML5, Book of Shadows può essere giocato su dispositivi desktop, mobili e tablet. Le immagini e le animazioni funzionano bene anche su schermi più piccoli.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nLe rotazioni libere con simboli espandibili rimangono il momento più desiderabile in questo caso, ma ci sono un paio di caratteristiche extra tra cui Lucky Locks, Gamble 50/50, e la Ruota del Bonus.\nAffrontiamo prima i Lucky Locks. Simile alla funzione Hyperspins di Microgaming, i giocatori possono bloccare le bobine in posizione per una scommessa regolata. Disponibile dopo ogni giro di gioco principale, i giocatori possono bloccare fino a 4 rulli in posizione. Il costo dipende dal mulinello, dal tipo di simbolo sui rulli e così via. È possibile bloccare due sparpagliamenti e respingere il resto nella speranza di atterrare il terzo, se lo si desidera.\nNessun ‘Book of’ slot è completo senza la possibilità di scommettere le vostre vincite. La funzione di gioco d’azzardo 50/50 è disponibile dopo i giri gratuiti o le vincite del gioco base. Si tratta di una semplice scelta di carte rosse o nere che raddoppierà o non raddoppierà i vostri soldi. Si possono giocare fino a cinque scommesse di fila, purché l’importo della vincita sia inferiore a 500.000 euro.\nLa Ruota del Bonus permette di scommettere per la possibilità di vincere giri gratis – a condizione che la vincita non superi il 60x della scommessa. Una ruota con un segmento evidenziato gira, la dimensione dipende dall’importo della tua vincita. Atterra nel segmento per raccogliere 10 giri gratis all’altezza della fila attuale.\nQuello a cui tutto si riduce è il gioco dei giri gratis, attivato dall’atterraggio di 3 o più simboli del libro in vista – 3 scatters premiano 10 giri gratis all’altezza della fila corrente, ma è possibile aumentare o diminuire il numero di file per ricevere più o meno giri gratis.\nPrima dell’inizio del giro, viene scelto a caso un simbolo dorato. Se non siete soddisfatti di quello offerto potete rimpasto una volta nella speranza di un aggiornamento. Può funzionare anche al contrario, quindi attenzione.\nDurante i giri liberi, i simboli dorati si espandono fino a coprire le bobine piene dopo che le linee di vincita sono state valutate. I simboli dorati espansi pagano tutte le linee di vincita da qualsiasi posizione; non devono essere necessariamente adiacenti. Il risultato finale è cinque ragazze goth su una griglia di 5 righe per una vincita di 10.000 volte la posta in palio. Inoltre, atterrando 3 o più book scatters su un free spin retrigger la caratteristica.\nIl gioco bonus viene attivato ogni 154 giri teoricamente, ma se non puoi aspettare, c’è un’opzione di acquisto della funzione. Se disponibile nella propria giurisdizione, il bonus Nolimit, come viene chiamato, costa 60x, 90x o 120x per 10 giri gratuiti con 3, 4 o 5 file rispettivamente.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nLa slot Deadwood è un gioco a 5 rulli, 576 modi per vincere, alimentato da Nolimit City. Disponibile per giocare su tutti i dispositivi a partire da 20p a giro, questa slot a tema Wild West viene fornita con Hunter xNudge Wilds che si espande e aumenta il moltiplicatore ad ogni colpo. C’è una funzione Shoot Out dove i simboli a basso valore fungono da wilds.\n\n        ",

                            "content": "Book of Shadows\nThe slot game, Book of Shadows, is a terrifying horror themed game from Nolimit City with an incredibly high volatility. You can choose to play with 3, 4 or 5 rows, each with 10, 15 or 20 paylines respectively. There is also a feature where you can lock in your reels for a price, which can come in handy if you land 2 scatters but miss the third one to activate the Free Spins feature. This feature rewards you with free spins complete with a special expanding symbol. With a potential win of 30,338 x your bet, we don't know what horrors await you in our Book of Shadows review.\n\nBook of Shadows is playable on any device from 10 cents to €100 per spin. The default setting is 3 rows but you can activate 4 or even 5 rows by clicking on the grid. This increases your bet by 1.5x or 2x, respectively. The RTP also varies based on the number of rows - 3, 4 or 5 rows in play produce RTPs of 96.01%, 96.07% or 96.19%, respectively.\n\nIn any case, the volatility remains the same - 10/10 or, if we go by Nolimit classes, it's \"Extreme\".\n\nThe basic rules are standard. Matching symbols from left to right from the first reel to produce a win. More rows mean more paylines, so 3, 4 or 5 rows provide 10, 15 or 20 Shadow Rows, as they are called.\n\nTruly terrifying graphics\nWith an obvious horror theme, the Book of Shadows slot game is truly frightening. Some horror cartoon slots play it for laughs in the style of Scooby Doo when it comes to design. But there is a much more unsettling feeling in Book of Shadows.\n\nThe slot game focuses on the book of spells, which according to Nolimit City, can alter the \"reel\" world's reality. It seems to be inspired by the book of shadows, which contains religious texts and instructions for magic rituals. In any case, the design here is simple but creates a decidedly chilling atmosphere.\n\nWith a nighttime forest backdrop, the reels include A in bloody red to 10 royal next to an eye in a flask, a butterfly, the skull of an animal, and a cat. The mysterious woman is the standard and most lucrative symbol, paying out 1, 2, 10 or 500 x your bet if you land 2, 3, 4 or 5 on a payline. The Book of Shadows symbol is both the wild and scatter symbol and offers the same payouts.\n\nProduced using HTML5 technology, Book of Shadows can be played on desktop, mobile and tablet devices. The images and animations also work well on smaller screens.\n\nThe slot machine's functions and symbols\nFree spins with expanding symbols remain the most desirable moment in this case, but there are a couple of extra features including Lucky Locks, Gamble 50/50, and the Bonus Wheel.\n\nLet's start with Lucky Locks. Similar to Microgaming's Hyperspins feature, players can lock their reels in place for a set bet. Available after every main game spin, players can lock up to 4 reels in place. The cost depends on the reel, the type of symbol on the reels, and so on. You can lock two scatters and reject the rest in the hopes of landing the third one if you wish.\n\nNo \"Book of\" slot would be complete without the chance to gamble your winnings. The 50/50 gamble feature is available after free spins or base game wins. It's a simple choice of red or black cards that will either double your money or leave it as is. You can play up to five bets in a row as long as the win amount is lower than €500,000.\n\nThe Bonus Wheel allows you to bet for the chance to win free spins - as long as the win doesn't exceed 60x your bet. A wheel with a highlighted segment spins; the size depends on your win amount. Land on the segment to collect 10 free spins at the current row level.\n\nThe ultimate goal is the free spins game, activated by landing 3 or more book symbols in view. 3 scatters award 10 free spins at the current row level, but you can increase or decrease the number of rows to receive more or fewer free spins.\n\nBefore the spin begins, a golden symbol is randomly chosen. If you are not happy with the one offered, you can reshuffle once in the hopes of an upgrade. It can also work the other way around, so be careful.\n\nDuring free spins, golden symbols expand to cover entire reels after the paylines have been evaluated. Expanded golden symbols pay out on all paylines from any position; they don't have to be adjacent. The final result is five goth girls on a 5-row grid for a win of 10,000 times the bet. Additionally, landing 3 or more book scatters on a free spin retriggers the feature.\n\nThe bonus game is activated every 154 spins in theory, but if you can't wait, there's an option to buy the feature. If available in your jurisdiction, the Nolimit bonus, as it's called, costs 60x, 90x, or 120x for 10 free spins with 3, 4, or 5 rows, respectively.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nThe Deadwood slot game is a Wild West themed 5 reel, 576 ways to win game powered by Nolimit City.

You can choose to play with 3, 4 or 5 rows, each with 10, 15 or 20 paylines respectively. There is also a feature where you can lock in your reels for a price, which can come in handy if you land 2 scatters but miss the third one to activate the Free Spins feature. This feature rewards you with free spins complete with a special expanding symbol. With a potential win of 30,338 x your bet, we don't know what horrors await you in our Book of Shadows review.\n\nBook of Shadows is playable on any device from 10 cents to €100 per spin. The default setting is 3 rows but you can activate 4 or even 5 rows by clicking on the grid. This increases your bet by 1.5x or 2x, respectively. The RTP also varies based on the number of rows - 3, 4 or 5 rows in play produce RTPs of 96.01%, 96.07% or 96.19%, respectively.\n\nIn any case, the volatility remains the same - 10/10 or, if we go by Nolimit classes, it's \"Extreme\".\n\nThe basic rules are standard. Matching symbols from left to right from the first reel to produce a win. More rows mean more paylines, so 3, 4 or 5 rows provide 10, 15 or 20 Shadow Rows, as they are called.\n\nTruly terrifying graphics\nWith an obvious horror theme, the Book of Shadows slot game is truly frightening. Some horror cartoon slots play it for laughs in the style of Scooby Doo when it comes to design. But there is a much more unsettling feeling in Book of Shadows.\n\nThe slot game focuses on the book of spells, which according to Nolimit City, can alter the \"reel\" world's reality. It seems to be inspired by the book of shadows, which contains religious texts and instructions for magic rituals. In any case, the design here is simple but creates a decidedly chilling atmosphere.\n\nWith a nighttime forest backdrop, the reels include A in bloody red to 10 royal next to an eye in a flask, a butterfly, the skull of an animal, and a cat. The mysterious woman is the standard and most lucrative symbol, paying out 1, 2, 10 or 500 x your bet if you land 2, 3, 4 or 5 on a payline. The Book of Shadows symbol is both the wild and scatter symbol and offers the same payouts.\n\nProduced using HTML5 technology, Book of Shadows can be played on desktop, mobile and tablet devices. The images and animations also work well on smaller screens.\n\nThe slot machine's functions and symbols\nFree spins with expanding symbols remain the most desirable moment in this case, but there are a couple of extra features including Lucky Locks, Gamble 50/50, and the Bonus Wheel.\n\nLet's start with Lucky Locks. Similar to Microgaming's Hyperspins feature, players can lock their reels in place for a set bet. Available after every main game spin, players can lock up to 4 reels in place. The cost depends on the reel, the type of symbol on the reels, and so on. You can lock two scatters and reject the rest in the hopes of landing the third one if you wish.\n\nNo \"Book of\" slot would be complete without the chance to gamble your winnings. The 50/50 gamble feature is available after free spins or base game wins. It's a simple choice of red or black cards that will either double your money or leave it as is. You can play up to five bets in a row as long as the win amount is lower than €500,000.\n\nThe Bonus Wheel allows you to bet for the chance to win free spins - as long as the win doesn't exceed 60x your bet. A wheel with a highlighted segment spins; the size depends on your win amount. Land on the segment to collect 10 free spins at the current row level.\n\nThe ultimate goal is the free spins game, activated by landing 3 or more book symbols in view. 3 scatters award 10 free spins at the current row level, but you can increase or decrease the number of rows to receive more or fewer free spins.\n\nBefore the spin begins, a golden symbol is randomly chosen. If you are not happy with the one offered, you can reshuffle once in the hopes of an upgrade. It can also work the other way around, so be careful.\n\nDuring free spins, golden symbols expand to cover entire reels after the paylines have been evaluated. Expanded golden symbols pay out on all paylines from any position; they don't have to be adjacent. The final result is five goth girls on a 5-row grid for a win of 10,000 times the bet. Additionally, landing 3 or more book scatters on a free spin retriggers the feature.\n\nThe bonus game is activated every 154 spins in theory, but if you can't wait, there's an option to buy the feature. If available in your jurisdiction, the Nolimit bonus, as it's called, costs 60x, 90x, or 120x for 10 free spins with 3, 4, or 5 rows, respectively.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nThe Deadwood slot game is a Wild West themed 5 reel, 576 ways to win game powered by Nolimit City. Available to play on all devices starting from 20p per spin, this game comes with Hunter xNudge Wilds that expand and increase the multiplier with each hit. There's a Shoot Out feature where low-value symbols act as wilds.\n            ",

You can choose to play with 3, 4 or 5 rows, each with 10, 15 or 20 paylines respectively. There is also a feature where you can lock in your reels for a price, which can come in handy if you land 2 scatters but miss the third one to activate the Free Spins feature. This feature rewards you with free spins complete with a special expanding symbol. With a potential win of 30,338 x your bet, we don't know what horrors await you in our Book of Shadows review.\n\nBook of Shadows is playable on any device from 10 cents to €100 per spin. The default setting is 3 rows but you can activate 4 or even 5 rows by clicking on the grid. This increases your bet by 1.5x or 2x, respectively. The RTP also varies based on the number of rows - 3, 4 or 5 rows in play produce RTPs of 96.01%, 96.07% or 96.19%, respectively.\n\nIn any case, the volatility remains the same - 10/10 or, if we go by Nolimit classes, it's \"Extreme\".\n\nThe basic rules are standard. Matching symbols from left to right from the first reel to produce a win. More rows mean more paylines, so 3, 4 or 5 rows provide 10, 15 or 20 Shadow Rows, as they are called.\n\nTruly terrifying graphics\nWith an obvious horror theme, the Book of Shadows slot game is truly frightening. Some horror cartoon slots play it for laughs in the style of Scooby Doo when it comes to design. But there is a much more unsettling feeling in Book of Shadows.\n\nThe slot game focuses on the book of spells, which according to Nolimit City, can alter the \"reel\" world's reality. It seems to be inspired by the book of shadows, which contains religious texts and instructions for magic rituals. In any case, the design here is simple but creates a decidedly chilling atmosphere.\n\nWith a nighttime forest backdrop, the reels include A in bloody red to 10 royal next to an eye in a flask, a butterfly, the skull of an animal, and a cat. The mysterious woman is the standard and most lucrative symbol, paying out 1, 2, 10 or 500 x your bet if you land 2, 3, 4 or 5 on a payline. The Book of Shadows symbol is both the wild and scatter symbol and offers the same payouts.\n\nProduced using HTML5 technology, Book of Shadows can be played on desktop, mobile and tablet devices. The images and animations also work well on smaller screens.\n\nThe slot machine's functions and symbols\nFree spins with expanding symbols remain the most desirable moment in this case, but there are a couple of extra features including Lucky Locks, Gamble 50/50, and the Bonus Wheel.\n\nLet's start with Lucky Locks. Similar to Microgaming's Hyperspins feature, players can lock their reels in place for a set bet. Available after every main game spin, players can lock up to 4 reels in place. The cost depends on the reel, the type of symbol on the reels, and so on. You can lock two scatters and reject the rest in the hopes of landing the third one if you wish.\n\nNo \"Book of\" slot would be complete without the chance to gamble your winnings. The 50/50 gamble feature is available after free spins or base game wins. It's a simple choice of red or black cards that will either double your money or leave it as is. You can play up to five bets in a row as long as the win amount is lower than €500,000.\n\nThe Bonus Wheel allows you to bet for the chance to win free spins - as long as the win doesn't exceed 60x your bet. A wheel with a highlighted segment spins; the size depends on your win amount. Land on the segment to collect 10 free spins at the current row level.\n\nThe ultimate goal is the free spins game, activated by landing 3 or more book symbols in view. 3 scatters award 10 free spins at the current row level, but you can increase or decrease the number of rows to receive more or fewer free spins.\n\nBefore the spin begins, a golden symbol is randomly chosen. If you are not happy with the one offered, you can reshuffle once in the hopes of an upgrade. It can also work the other way around, so be careful.\n\nDuring free spins, golden symbols expand to cover entire reels after the paylines have been evaluated. Expanded golden symbols pay out on all paylines from any position; they don't have to be adjacent. The final result is five goth girls on a 5-row grid for a win of 10,000 times the bet. Additionally, landing 3 or more book scatters on a free spin retriggers the feature.\n\nThe bonus game is activated every 154 spins in theory, but if you can't wait, there's an option to buy the feature. If available in your jurisdiction, the Nolimit bonus, as it's called, costs 60x, 90x, or 120x for 10 free spins with 3, 4, or 5 rows, respectively.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nThe Deadwood slot game is a Wild West themed 5 reel, 576 ways to win game powered by Nolimit City. Available to play on all devices starting from 20p per spin, this game comes with Hunter xNudge Wilds that expand and increase the multiplier with each hit. There's a Shoot Out feature where low-value symbols act as wilds.\n            ",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a review of the game \"Book of Shadows\".\n\nPlease provide an FAQ:\n\n- 8 questions\n- Use simple language and provide practical takeaways.\n- Respond with a JSON!\n- Use the key \"faq\" and an array with the keys \"question\" and \"answer\". \n\nReview: Book of Shadows\nThe slot game, Book of Shadows, is a terrifying horror themed game from Nolimit City with an incredibly high volatility. You can choose to play with 3, 4 or 5 rows, each with 10, 15 or 20 paylines respectively. There is also a feature where you can lock in your reels for a price, which can come in handy if you land 2 scatters but miss the third one to activate the Free Spins feature. This feature rewards you with free spins complete with a special expanding symbol. With a potential win of 30,338 x your bet, we don't know what horrors await you in our Book of Shadows review.\n\nBook of Shadows is playable on any device from 10 cents to €100 per spin. The default setting is 3 rows but you can activate 4 or even 5 rows by clicking on the grid. This increases your bet by 1.5x or 2x, respectively. The RTP also varies based on the number of rows - 3, 4 or 5 rows in play produce RTPs of 96.01%, 96.07% or 96.19%, respectively.\n\nIn any case, the volatility remains the same - 10/10 or, if we go by Nolimit classes, it's \"Extreme\".\n\nThe basic rules are standard. Matching symbols from left to right from the first reel to produce a win. More rows mean more paylines, so 3, 4 or 5 rows provide 10, 15 or 20 Shadow Rows, as they are called.\n\nTruly terrifying graphics\nWith an obvious horror theme, the Book of Shadows slot game is truly frightening. Some horror cartoon slots play it for laughs in the style of Scooby Doo when it comes to design. But there is a much more unsettling feeling in Book of Shadows.\n\nThe slot game focuses on the book of spells, which according to Nolimit City, can alter the \"reel\" world's reality. It seems to be inspired by the book of shadows, which contains religious texts and instructions for magic rituals. In any case, the design here is simple but creates a decidedly chilling atmosphere.\n\nWith a nighttime forest backdrop, the reels include A in bloody red to 10 royal next to an eye in a flask, a butterfly, the skull of an animal, and a cat. The mysterious woman is the standard and most lucrative symbol, paying out 1, 2, 10 or 500 x your bet if you land 2, 3, 4 or 5 on a payline. The Book of Shadows symbol is both the wild and scatter symbol and offers the same payouts.\n\nProduced using HTML5 technology, Book of Shadows can be played on desktop, mobile and tablet devices. The images and animations also work well on smaller screens.\n\nThe slot machine's functions and symbols\nFree spins with expanding symbols remain the most desirable moment in this case, but there are a couple of extra features including Lucky Locks, Gamble 50/50, and the Bonus Wheel.\n\nLet's start with Lucky Locks. Similar to Microgaming's Hyperspins feature, players can lock their reels in place for a set bet. Available after every main game spin, players can lock up to 4 reels in place. The cost depends on the reel, the type of symbol on the reels, and so on. You can lock two scatters and reject the rest in the hopes of landing the third one if you wish.\n\nNo \"Book of\" slot would be complete without the chance to gamble your winnings. The 50/50 gamble feature is available after free spins or base game wins. It's a simple choice of red or black cards that will either double your money or leave it as is. You can play up to five bets in a row as long as the win amount is lower than €500,000.\n\nThe Bonus Wheel allows you to bet for the chance to win free spins - as long as the win doesn't exceed 60x your bet. A wheel with a highlighted segment spins; the size depends on your win amount. Land on the segment to collect 10 free spins at the current row level.\n\nThe ultimate goal is the free spins game, activated by landing 3 or more book symbols in view. 3 scatters award 10 free spins at the current row level, but you can increase or decrease the number of rows to receive more or fewer free spins.\n\nBefore the spin begins, a golden symbol is randomly chosen. If you are not happy with the one offered, you can reshuffle once in the hopes of an upgrade. It can also work the other way around, so be careful.\n\nDuring free spins, golden symbols expand to cover entire reels after the paylines have been evaluated. Expanded golden symbols pay out on all paylines from any position; they don't have to be adjacent. The final result is five goth girls on a 5-row grid for a win of 10,000 times the bet. Additionally, landing 3 or more book scatters on a free spin retriggers the feature.\n\nThe bonus game is activated every 154 spins in theory, but if you can't wait, there's an option to buy the feature. If available in your jurisdiction, the Nolimit bonus, as it's called, costs 60x, 90x, or 120x for 10 free spins with 3, 4, or 5 rows, respectively.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nThe Deadwood slot game is a Wild West themed 5 reel, 576 ways to win game powered by Nolimit City. Available to play on all devices starting from 20p per spin, this game comes with Hunter xNudge Wilds that expand and increase the multiplier with each hit. There's a Shoot Out feature where low-value symbols act as wilds.\n            ",
