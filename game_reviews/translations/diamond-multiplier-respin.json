It includes two special symbols that make this slot game a cut above others. The diamond is the Wild symbol, which is fitting because it's every player's best friend. It replaces all other symbols and even offers 2x or 5x multipliers on reel 1 or 3 and 2x to 5x multipliers on reel 3. This diamond in the rough doesn't need any polishing.</p>\n\n    <p>Every time a Wild completes a winning combination, a Respin is triggered, with the special symbol remaining stuck to the reels. It's like getting a second chance, but without any regrets. You'll be feeling like a big winner once you see how often these Respins are triggered.</p>\n\n    <p>But wait, there's more! The Free Spins sign is the Scatter, and it offers ten free spins. Who doesn't love free stuff? During these free spins, the wild respin feature is active and does not reduce the number of free spins. It's like getting a bonus on top of a bonus, like a free hat with a new suit.</p>\n\n    <p>Overall, Diamond Multiplier Respin sticks to traditional slot game structures but adds a little bit of shine with its two special symbols. Don't let this diamond slip through your fingers. Give it a spin and see if you can strike it rich!</p>\"\n}"

The minimum bet is 0.90 virtual coins and there is no Autoplay function. The game is available for both desktop and mobile devices thanks to HTML5 technology. The volatility is medium-high and the theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95.61%.\n\nGraphics\n\nDiamond Multiplier Respin is characterized by simplicity and minimalism. The game grid is in the center of the screen, with symbols that are crisp and in high definition with vibrant colors. There are no animations or major innovations present. The background consists of a red 3D room with moving checkered walls, giving the impression that the grid is progressing inside a spaceship. The music is an '80s dance tune that is pleasant to listen to.\n\nPayouts\n\nThere are only five base symbols in Diamond Multiplier Respin, with the triple BAR sign being the highest paying. The diamond is the Wild symbol, which can appear on reels 1 and 3, and has a multiplier of either 2x or 5x, while on reel 3, the multiplier ranges from 2x to 5x. Every time a Wild completes a winning combo, a Respin is triggered, with the special symbol remaining stuck to the reels. The Free Spins sign is the Scatter, awarding 10 free spins, during which the Wild Respin feature is active and does not reduce the number of free spins. If three more scatters land, an additional 10 free spins are added. Payout details for each symbol are available by clicking the info button in the game menu.\n\nMobile Compatibility\n\nDiamond Multiplier Respin is available for both desktop and mobile devices due to it being developed using HTML5 technology. This feature makes the game easy to play on smartphones and tablets on the go. The game will run smoothly on iOS, Android, and Windows devices with no additional software or plugins required.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nDiamond Multiplier Respin includes two special symbols that offer unique functionality. The diamond is the Wild symbol, replacing all other symbols while offering 2x or 5x multipliers on reel 1 or 3 and 2x to 5x multipliers on reel 3. Every time a Wild completes a winning combination, a Respin is triggered, with the special symbol remaining stuck to the reels. The Free Spins sign is the Scatter, offering ten free spins during which the wild respin feature is active and does not reduce the number of free spins. There are no other special features in the game, which follows a traditional slot game structure.\n\n        \n            ",

We are used to seeing games inspired by classic slot machines that used symbols such as fruits and bells. However, in this game, there are only two classic symbols - the red and golden number 7s, and three different BAR signs.\n\nGraphically, Diamond Multiplier Respin is characterized by essentiality, with the game grid in the center of the screen and a red three-dimensional room with moving checkered walls serving as a background, giving the impression that the grid is progressing inside a spaceship. Let it be clear that just because the graphics are simple does not mean they are poor, but rather that there are no animations or major innovations present. The symbols are in high definition, with crisp lines making them clear and vibrant colors adding dynamism to the game.\n\nThe music is also beautiful - an '80s dance tune that keeps you company.\n\nDiamond Multiplier Respin Features\nAs mentioned in the introduction, this game is very simple in all aspects. The game grid is minimal, with dimensions of 3x3 and nine non-adjustable paylines.\n\nThe minimum bet is 0.90 virtual coins, as we are playing with the Demo version. Unlike the vast majority of slots games, there is no Autoplay function here.\n\nThe game is available for any device, fixed and mobile, thanks to HTML5 technology. The volatility is medium-high, and the theoretical return to the player stands at 95.61%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\nThere are only five base symbols here - the single, double, and triple BAR signs. Of course, the more signs, the higher the payout. There are also the red and golden number 7s, with precise payment details being accessible by clicking the info button in the menu.\n\nThe diamond is the Wild and replaces all other symbols. When it appears on reels 1 and 3, it has a multiplier of either 2x or 5x, while, on reel 3, the multiplier ranges from 2x to 5x. Moreover, every time a Wild completes a winning combo, a Respin is triggered, during which the special symbol remains stuck to the reels.\n\nOn combinations of only Wild symbols, very high payouts can be obtained.\n\nThe Free Spins sign is the Scatter and awards us with 10 free spins, during which the Wild Respin feature is active and does not reduce the number of free spins. If three more scatters land, an additional 10 free spins are added.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhere can I play Diamond Multiplier Respin?\n\nThis game, which has just hit the market, will soon be available on all major online casinos.\n\nHow many symbols are there in this game?\n\nThere are a total of 7 symbols, five base symbols and two special symbols.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to the player (RTP)?\n\nIt is 95.61% in Diamond Multiplier Respin.\n            ",

We are used to seeing games inspired by classic slot machines that used symbols such as fruits and bells. However, in this game, there are only two classic symbols - the red and golden number 7s, and three different BAR signs.\n\nGraphically, Diamond Multiplier Respin is characterized by essentiality, with the game grid in the center of the screen and a red three-dimensional room with moving checkered walls serving as a background, giving the impression that the grid is progressing inside a spaceship. Let it be clear that just because the graphics are simple does not mean they are poor, but rather that there are no animations or major innovations present. The symbols are in high definition, with crisp lines making them clear and vibrant colors adding dynamism to the game.\n\nThe music is also beautiful - an '80s dance tune that keeps you company.\n\nDiamond Multiplier Respin Features\nAs mentioned in the introduction, this game is very simple in all aspects. The game grid is minimal, with dimensions of 3x3 and nine non-adjustable paylines.\n\nThe minimum bet is 0.90 virtual coins, as we are playing with the Demo version. Unlike the vast majority of slots games, there is no Autoplay function here.\n\nThe game is available for any device, fixed and mobile, thanks to HTML5 technology. The volatility is medium-high, and the theoretical return to the player stands at 95.61%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities\nThere are only five base symbols here - the single, double, and triple BAR signs. Of course, the more signs, the higher the payout. There are also the red and golden number 7s, with precise payment details being accessible by clicking the info button in the menu.\n\nThe diamond is the Wild and replaces all other symbols. When it appears on reels 1 and 3, it has a multiplier of either 2x or 5x, while, on reel 3, the multiplier ranges from 2x to 5x. Moreover, every time a Wild completes a winning combo, a Respin is triggered, during which the special symbol remains stuck to the reels.\n\nOn combinations of only Wild symbols, very high payouts can be obtained.\n\nThe Free Spins sign is the Scatter and awards us with 10 free spins, during which the Wild Respin feature is active and does not reduce the number of free spins. If three more scatters land, an additional 10 free spins are added.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhere can I play Diamond Multiplier Respin?\n\nThis game, which has just hit the market, will soon be available on all major online casinos.\n\nHow many symbols are there in this game?\n\nThere are a total of 7 symbols, five base symbols and two special symbols.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to the player (RTP)?\n\nIt is 95.61% in Diamond Multiplier Respin.\n            ",
