    "original_text": "\nDragon Auto Chess\nIl caro vecchio gioco degli Scacchi non passa mai di moda, anzi piace così tanto da essere usato come tema centrale per sviluppare una delle slot machine che si presenta come tra più sorprendenti di sempre. Abbiamo avuto modo di provarla e nonostante un breve momento di scetticismo iniziale ci siamo dovuti piacevolmente ricredere. Il provider che ha firmato questa slot è DreamTech che ci sta regalando tanti piacevoli titoli, capaci di sorprendere per lo stile estetico e di gioco. Chi ha avuto modo di provare altri giochi della software house saprà che il lavoro grafico del suo team di sviluppatori è alquanto particolare, proprio perché non presenta cose già viste e riviste, ma cerca sempre di pensare alla particolarità.\nDi seguito scopriremo quali sono i punti di forza di una macchinetta che sicuramente farà parlare di se per Big Win e soluzioni bonus molto semplici ed efficaci.\nGrafica e Simboli di gioco\nDragon Auto Chess ha un gameplay piacevole e lineare che ci porta su una griglia che vuole rivivere il gioco degli scacchi. Le nostre icone di gioco sono le classiche figure reiventate in stile cartoon, mentre alle spalle del tabellone troviamo un grande castello. La struttura parte da 5 rulli e offre a ogni giocatore 243 modi per vincere.\nTra i simboli scelti per generare combinazioni vincenti troviamo il Re, un Mago, un Arciere, un Arco, una Freccia, una Spada, un Libro e molto altro ancora. Le icone speciali prevedono invece il Drago, scelto come simbolo Scatter. Se ne riesci almeno tre su qualsiasi punto della griglia puoi attivare la funziona Free Spin, che ti aiuterà a generare interessanti vittorie. Nel momento in cui è attivo il bonus game, con l’icona del Re puoi avviare una battaglia contro il Drago. E ovviamente iniziare a sperare di portarti a casa un ricco credito. Ogni volta che riuscirai a realizzare delle combinazioni vincenti potrai ammirare il sistema base su cui si affida il gioco, ovvero quello a cascata, che porta a eliminare i simboli per farne apparire degli altri. E’ così che potrai sperare di continuare a realizzare delle combinazioni.\nOgni giocatore potrà stabilire il valore del moltiplicatore e quindi agire su quella che sarà la scommessa finale, in modo da avere sempre sotto controllo il proprio credito. E’ prevista l’immancabile funzione Autoplay che aiuta a selezionare un numero di giri automatici che porteranno la slot a girare senza alcun tipo di interruzioni.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Dragon Auto Chess\nLa versatilità del gioco, la sua semplicità e le alte vincite che genera ci portano a promuoverla a pieni voti. Perché in questo caso anche se non vi è massimo lavoro grafico è fin troppo banale considerarla come una slot mediocre visto anche il tipo di funzionalità e bonus extra che prevede. Non dimentichiamo che il Return to Player (RTP) è fissato a un valore di 97,25%, ben al di sopra della media.\nInsomma, se hai voglia di lanciarti in un’avventura davvero semplice ma completa, non dovrai fare molta strada: prova Dragon Auto Chess e lasciati sorprendere dal Re e i suoi compagni di gioco.\n",

We had the chance to try it out, and despite some initial skepticism, we were pleasantly surprised. The provider behind this slot is DreamTech, who is giving us a lot of enjoyable titles that are capable of surprising us with their aesthetic and gameplay style. Those who have tried other games from this software house will know that the graphic work of their development team is quite unique, because they don't present things that have already been seen and done, but always try to think outside the box.\n\nNext, we'll discover the strengths of a machine that will definitely make a name for itself with Big Wins and very simple yet effective bonus solutions.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nDragon Auto Chess has a pleasant and straightforward gameplay that takes us to a grid that aims to relive the game of chess. Our game icons are the classic pieces reinvented in cartoon style, while behind the board we find a large castle. The structure starts with 5 reels and offers each player 243 ways to win.\n\nAmong the symbols chosen to generate winning combinations, we find the King, a Mage, an Archer, a Bow, an Arrow, a Sword, a Book and much more. The special icons, on the other hand, include the Dragon, chosen as the Scatter symbol. If you get at least three of them on any point on the grid, you can activate the Free Spin function, which will help you generate interesting wins. When the bonus game is active, with the King icon, you can start a battle against the Dragon. And of course, start hoping to bring home a big credit. Every time you manage to make winning combinations, you can admire the basic system the game relies on, which is the cascade system, which eliminates symbols to bring up others. That's how you can hope to keep making combinations.\n\nEach player can set the multiplier value and then act on what will be the final bet, in order to always keep their credit under control. The inevitable Autoplay function is provided, which helps to select a number of automatic spins that will make the slot spin without any interruptions.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Dragon Auto Chess Slot\n\nThe versatility of the game, its simplicity, and the high rewards it generates lead us to fully endorse it. In this case, even if there is not maximum graphic work, it is far too simplistic to consider it a mediocre slot, especially considering the kind of functionality and extra bonuses it provides. Let's not forget that the Return to Player (RTP) is set at a value of 97.25%, well above average.\n\nIn short, if you're looking to embark on a truly simple yet complete adventure, you won't have to go far: try Dragon Auto Chess and be amazed by the King and his gaming companions.\n            ",

The provider behind this slot is DreamTech, who is giving us a lot of enjoyable titles that are capable of surprising us with their aesthetic and gameplay style. Those who have tried other games from this software house will know that the graphic work of their development team is quite unique, because they don't present things that have already been seen and done, but always try to think outside the box.\n\nNext, we'll discover the strengths of a machine that will definitely make a name for itself with Big Wins and very simple yet effective bonus solutions.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nDragon Auto Chess has a pleasant and straightforward gameplay that takes us to a grid that aims to relive the game of chess. Our game icons are the classic pieces reinvented in cartoon style, while behind the board we find a large castle. The structure starts with 5 reels and offers each player 243 ways to win.\n\nAmong the symbols chosen to generate winning combinations, we find the King, a Mage, an Archer, a Bow, an Arrow, a Sword, a Book and much more. The special icons, on the other hand, include the Dragon, chosen as the Scatter symbol. If you get at least three of them on any point on the grid, you can activate the Free Spin function, which will help you generate interesting wins. When the bonus game is active, with the King icon, you can start a battle against the Dragon. And of course, start hoping to bring home a big credit. Every time you manage to make winning combinations, you can admire the basic system the game relies on, which is the cascade system, which eliminates symbols to bring up others. That's how you can hope to keep making combinations.\n\nEach player can set the multiplier value and then act on what will be the final bet, in order to always keep their credit under control.

Let's not forget that the Return to Player (RTP) is set at a value of 97.25%, well above average.\n\nIn short, if you're looking to embark on a truly simple yet complete adventure, you won't have to go far: try Dragon Auto Chess and be amazed by the King and his gaming companions.\n            ",
