It is a technological gem, with exceptional graphics that provide the perfect backdrop for a game full of symbols and special features.\nThe \"gem\" of this slot is undoubtedly the Sticky Win function, which allows players to increase the fun and, most importantly, the chances of winning!\nThe theme of the slot is royalty and luxury: we find ourselves in the rich palace of the king of slots, surrounded by glittering jewels and fairy tale decorations, in a world where even fruit becomes precious!\n\nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters\nThe symbols of King of Slots are linked to the world of wealth in a Royal key! In a very linear background of velvety blue color, the crown studded with precious stones and a triplet of diamonds are displayed on the five reels, along with different fruits, including cherries, watermelon, and lemon, revisited in a gemstone key.\nNetEnt's choice of symbols is clearly a tribute to the first slot machines, the mythical Fruit Machine, but here the fruits are represented in a new and original way: this is a very successful expedient to combine extremely innovative graphics with the tradition of old land-based slot machines, with a visually beautiful result.\nNext to the precious fruits, we find numbers and letters referring to poker cards from 9 to Ace: once again, this is a reference to gaming halls, introduced with a linear and clean but elegant graphic.\nThe crown is the highest paying symbol: if it appears on all five reels in an active payline, it pays a whopping 1000 times the bet!\nThe Wild symbol is a blue diamond that serves as the Joker, replacing all other symbols except the Scatter, when completing a winning lineup.\nThe Scatter is represented by the image of three diamonds: 5 of these symbols are required to activate free spins, but once in the bonus game, more of them can be won. In addition, during free spins, a 3x multiplier is applied to all winnings.\n\nThe Sticky Win feature\nThanks to this special feature of King of Slots, players can, once they have obtained a winning combination, lock the symbols that determined it on the reels and spin only the remaining ones on the next spin. \nIn this way, as you might have guessed, there are many more possible winning combinations and therefore more chances to see your prize money increase.\n\nKing of Slots: Conclusions\nThis is not a new slot machine at NetEnt, as they had already proposed another one with the same title.

High definition and Sticky Win function are the strengths of the game, which is pleasant and entertaining, as well as offering excellent chances of winning!\n\n\nFAQs\nHow can you win playing King of Slots?\n\nThis is a certified title that generates random results (RNG) and all you need is luck and some tips. For example, check the paytable to see how and how much you can win and if there are extra features like Bonus Game and Multipliers.\n\nDoes King of Slots have a Free Spins function?\n\nYes!

It is a technological gem, with exceptional graphics that provide the perfect backdrop for a game full of symbols and special features.\nThe \"gem\" of this slot is undoubtedly the Sticky Win function, which allows players to increase the fun and, most importantly, the chances of winning!\nThe theme of the slot is royalty and luxury: we find ourselves in the rich palace of the king of slots, surrounded by glittering jewels and fairy tale decorations, in a world where even fruit becomes precious!\n\nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters\nThe symbols of King of Slots are linked to the world of wealth in a Royal key! In a very linear background of velvety blue color, the crown studded with precious stones and a triplet of diamonds are displayed on the five reels, along with different fruits, including cherries, watermelon, and lemon, revisited in a gemstone key.\nNetEnt's choice of symbols is clearly a tribute to the first slot machines, the mythical Fruit Machine, but here the fruits are represented in a new and original way: this is a very successful expedient to combine extremely innovative graphics with the tradition of old land-based slot machines, with a visually beautiful result.\nNext to the precious fruits, we find numbers and letters referring to poker cards from 9 to Ace: once again, this is a reference to gaming halls, introduced with a linear and clean but elegant graphic.\nThe crown is the highest paying symbol: if it appears on all five reels in an active payline, it pays a whopping 1000 times the bet!\nThe Wild symbol is a blue diamond that serves as the Joker, replacing all other symbols except the Scatter, when completing a winning lineup.\nThe Scatter is represented by the image of three diamonds: 5 of these symbols are required to activate free spins, but once in the bonus game, more of them can be won. In addition, during free spins, a 3x multiplier is applied to all winnings.\n\nThe Sticky Win feature\nThanks to this special feature of King of Slots, players can, once they have obtained a winning combination, lock the symbols that determined it on the reels and spin only the remaining ones on the next spin. \nIn this way, as you might have guessed, there are many more possible winning combinations and therefore more chances to see your prize money increase.\n\nKing of Slots: Conclusions\nThis is not a new slot machine at NetEnt, as they had already proposed another one with the same title. The content, however, appears decidedly renewed, both from the point of view of graphics and gameplay. High definition and Sticky Win function are the strengths of the game, which is pleasant and entertaining, as well as offering excellent chances of winning!\n\n\nFAQs\nHow can you win playing King of Slots?\n\nThis is a certified title that generates random results (RNG) and all you need is luck and some tips. For example, check the paytable to see how and how much you can win and if there are extra features like Bonus Game and Multipliers.\n\nDoes King of Slots have a Free Spins function?\n\nYes! You can get it from the Sticky Wins™ function or simply match 5 or more Scatter symbols and win up to 30 free spins.\n\nCan I play King of Slots for free?\n\nYes, Slotjava is the perfect place to test King of Slots without registering. Any gaming site that collaborates with NetEnt allows both trial mode and real money playing.\n        ",

In addition, during free spins, a 3x multiplier is applied to all winnings.\n\nThe Sticky Win feature\nThanks to this special feature of King of Slots, players can, once they have obtained a winning combination, lock the symbols that determined it on the reels and spin only the remaining ones on the next spin. \nIn this way, as you might have guessed, there are many more possible winning combinations and therefore more chances to see your prize money increase.\n\nKing of Slots: Conclusions\nThis is not a new slot machine at NetEnt, as they had already proposed another one with the same title. The content, however, appears decidedly renewed, both from the point of view of graphics and gameplay. High definition and Sticky Win function are the strengths of the game, which is pleasant and entertaining, as well as offering excellent chances of winning!\n\n\nFAQs\nHow can you win playing King of Slots?\n\nThis is a certified title that generates random results (RNG) and all you need is luck and some tips. For example, check the paytable to see how and how much you can win and if there are extra features like Bonus Game and Multipliers.\n\nDoes King of Slots have a Free Spins function?\n\nYes! You can get it from the Sticky Wins™ function or simply match 5 or more Scatter symbols and win up to 30 free spins.\n\nCan I play King of Slots for free?\n\nYes, Slotjava is the perfect place to test King of Slots without registering. Any gaming site that collaborates with NetEnt allows both trial mode and real money playing.\n            ",

It is a technological gem, with exceptional graphics that provide the perfect backdrop for a game full of symbols and special features.\nThe \"gem\" of this slot is undoubtedly the Sticky Win function, which allows players to increase the fun and, most importantly, the chances of winning!\nThe theme of the slot is royalty and luxury: we find ourselves in the rich palace of the king of slots, surrounded by glittering jewels and fairy tale decorations, in a world where even fruit becomes precious!\n\nSymbols, Wilds, and Scatters\nThe symbols of King of Slots are linked to the world of wealth in a Royal key! In a very linear background of velvety blue color, the crown studded with precious stones and a triplet of diamonds are displayed on the five reels, along with different fruits, including cherries, watermelon, and lemon, revisited in a gemstone key.\nNetEnt's choice of symbols is clearly a tribute to the first slot machines, the mythical Fruit Machine, but here the fruits are represented in a new and original way: this is a very successful expedient to combine extremely innovative graphics with the tradition of old land-based slot machines, with a visually beautiful result.\nNext to the precious fruits, we find numbers and letters referring to poker cards from 9 to Ace: once again, this is a reference to gaming halls, introduced with a linear and clean but elegant graphic.\nThe crown is the highest paying symbol: if it appears on all five reels in an active payline, it pays a whopping 1000 times the bet!\nThe Wild symbol is a blue diamond that serves as the Joker, replacing all other symbols except the Scatter, when completing a winning lineup.\nThe Scatter is represented by the image of three diamonds: 5 of these symbols are required to activate free spins, but once in the bonus game, more of them can be won. In addition, during free spins, a 3x multiplier is applied to all winnings.\n\nThe Sticky Win feature\nThanks to this special feature of King of Slots, players can, once they have obtained a winning combination, lock the symbols that determined it on the reels and spin only the remaining ones on the next spin. \nIn this way, as you might have guessed, there are many more possible winning combinations and therefore more chances to see your prize money increase.\n\nKing of Slots: Conclusions\nThis is not a new slot machine at NetEnt, as they had already proposed another one with the same title. The content, however, appears decidedly renewed, both from the point of view of graphics and gameplay. High definition and Sticky Win function are the strengths of the game, which is pleasant and entertaining, as well as offering excellent chances of winning!\n\n\nFAQs\nHow can you win playing King of Slots?\n\nThis is a certified title that generates random results (RNG) and all you need is luck and some tips. For example, check the paytable to see how and how much you can win and if there are extra features like Bonus Game and Multipliers.\n\nDoes King of Slots have a Free Spins function?\n\nYes! You can get it from the Sticky Wins™ function or simply match 5 or more Scatter symbols and win up to 30 free spins.\n\nCan I play King of Slots for free?\n\nYes, Slotjava is the perfect place to test King of Slots without registering. Any gaming site that collaborates with NetEnt allows both trial mode and real money playing.\n        ",
