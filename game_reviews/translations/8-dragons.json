With a bonus system that leads to impressive wins, this game takes things up a notch. As the title suggests, 8 Dragons draws from Chinese traditions with well-crafted symbols set against a red background - a color that is fundamental in ancient Chinese culture.\n\nThe graphics for 8 Dragons are impeccable, with large symbols and strategically placed buttons to facilitate gameplay. The Oriental music is an added touch that never gets in the way. However, you can easily turn it off with a dedicated button.\n\nPlenty of Ways to Win\n\nThe game grid consists of the traditional 5 reels and 3 rows, presenting a whopping 243 ways to win. Bet sizes range from 2 coins to 800 coins, with options for activating automatic spins or spinning the reels at a faster pace.\n\nA Plethora of Bonuses for Amazing Wins\n\nIn 8 Dragons, there are 11 regular symbols and three special symbols. The abstract shapes and mandalas that stem from Chinese traditions are the least valuable symbols. Next up are flowers, a pot of gold coins, a turtle, a tiger, and a phoenix.\n\nNow onto the special symbols. The dragon serves as the Wild, with six different color variations, each with its own multiplier. For instance, a green dragon and five symbols on an active payline come with a 10x multiplier. Red, blue, and yellow dragons pay out the same amount with five symbols, but they offer a better payout with four symbols. The purple and red dragons reach a 20x multiplier.\n\nThe Scatter symbols are the three golden circles and the golden coin. Both of these symbols activate Free Spins, with the added perk of being able to select the number of spins and multiplier. Here are the different options:\n\n- The white dragon offers 25 free spins and multipliers of 2x, 3x, or 5x.\n- The red dragon offers 20 free spins and multipliers of 3x, 5x, or 8x.\n- The silver dragon offers 15 free spins and multipliers of 5x, 8x, or 10x.\n- The purple dragon offers a random number of free spins and multipliers.\n- The blue dragon offers 13 free spins and multipliers of 8x, 10x, or 15x.\n- The yellow dragon offers 10 free spins and multipliers of 10x, 15x, or 30x.\n\nFinally, the green dragon offers 6 free spins and multipliers of 15x, 30x, or 40x.",

With 8 Dragons, the level is even higher than usual, thanks to a bonus system that leads to decent wins. As the title suggests, this slot also draws on Chinese tradition, with well-designed symbols that appear against a red background, a color found in every celebration of this ancient culture.\n\nGraphically, 8 Dragons is impeccable, with large symbols and buttons placed in an optimal position to facilitate gameplay. The oriental music adds that extra touch that never disturbs. However, it can be easily deactivated at any time with the appropriate button.\n\nMany ways to win\n\nThe game grid has a traditional configuration, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The number of ways to win is very high, with 243 possible combinations. The betting range is also quite broad, ranging from a minimum of 2 coins to a maximum of 800.\n\nFrom the screen, it is possible to activate both automatic spins and an accelerator that makes the reels spin faster.\n\nA myriad of bonuses for absolute-level wins\n\nIn 8 Dragons, there are 11 regular symbols and three special symbols. The symbols with the lowest value are abstract forms of Chinese tradition, backgrounds, and mandalas. Following these, we find flowers, a pot full of gold coins, a turtle, a tiger and a phoenix.\n\nNow let's move on to the special symbols. The dragon is our Wild and there are six different colored variants, each with its own multiplier. For example, with a green dragon and five symbols on an active payline, a 10x multiplier is applied to the winnings. Red, blue and yellow pay the same amount with five symbols, but reward more in combinations of four. The red and purple symbols reach up to 20x.\n\nThe Scatter symbols are three golden circles and a golden coin. Both give us access to Free Spins, but we'll have the chance to choose the number of free spins and the multiplier. Let's take a closer look at the various options:\n\nWhite dragon offers us 25 Free Spins and multipliers of 2x, 3x, or 5x.\nRed dragon offers us 20 Free Spins and multipliers of 3x, 5x, or 8x.\nSilver dragon offers us 15 Free Spins and multipliers of 5x, 8x, or 10x.\nPurple dragon offers us a random number of Free Spins and multipliers.\nBlue dragon offers us 13 Free Spins and multipliers of 8x, 10x, or 15x.\nYellow dragon offers us 10 Free Spins and multipliers of 10x, 15x, or 30x.\n\nGreen dragon offers us 6 Free Spins and multipliers of 15x, 30x, or 40x.\n\nIn conclusion, 8 Dragons is a delightful slot game that offers a wide range of betting options, great graphics, and a variety of bonuses that keep the gameplay exciting. Definitely recommended for experienced gamblers who are looking for something new and exciting.\n            ",

The symbols with the lowest value are abstract forms of Chinese tradition, backgrounds, and mandalas. Following these, we find flowers, a pot full of gold coins, a turtle, a tiger and a phoenix. The dragon is our Wild and there are six different colored variants, each with its own multiplier. For example, with a green dragon and five symbols on an active payline, a 10x multiplier is applied to the winnings. Red, blue and yellow pay the same amount with five symbols, but reward more in combinations of four. The red and purple symbols reach up to 20x. The Scatter symbols are three golden circles and a golden coin.\n\nBonus System\n\nBoth Scatter symbols give us access to Free Spins, but we'll have the chance to choose the number of free spins and the multiplier. There are six dragons that offer different numbers of free spins and different multipliers. Green dragon offers us 6 Free Spins and multipliers of 15x, 30x, or 40x. Yellow dragon offers us 10 Free Spins and multipliers of 10x, 15x, or 30x. Blue dragon offers us 13 Free Spins and multipliers of 8x, 10x, or 15x. Purple dragon offers us a random number of Free Spins and multipliers. Silver dragon offers us 15 Free Spins and multipliers of 5x, 8x, or 10x. Red dragon offers us 20 Free Spins and multipliers of 3x, 5x, or 8x. White dragon offers us 25 Free Spins and multipliers of 2x, 3x, or 5x.\n\nBetting Range\n\nThe betting range of 8 Dragons is quite broad, ranging from a minimum of 2 coins to a maximum of 800.\n\n        \n            ",

The betting range is also quite broad, ranging from a minimum of 2 coins to a maximum of 800.\n\nFrom the screen, it is possible to activate both automatic spins and an accelerator that makes the reels spin faster.\n\nA myriad of bonuses for absolute-level wins\n\nIn 8 Dragons, there are 11 regular symbols and three special symbols. The symbols with the lowest value are abstract forms of Chinese tradition, backgrounds, and mandalas. Following these, we find flowers, a pot full of gold coins, a turtle, a tiger and a phoenix.\n\nNow let's move on to the special symbols. The dragon is our Wild and there are six different colored variants, each with its own multiplier. For example, with a green dragon and five symbols on an active payline, a 10x multiplier is applied to the winnings. Red, blue and yellow pay the same amount with five symbols, but reward more in combinations of four. The red and purple symbols reach up to 20x.\n\nThe Scatter symbols are three golden circles and a golden coin. Both give us access to Free Spins, but we'll have the chance to choose the number of free spins and the multiplier. Let's take a closer look at the various options:\n\nWhite dragon offers us 25 Free Spins and multipliers of 2x, 3x, or 5x.\nRed dragon offers us 20 Free Spins and multipliers of 3x, 5x, or 8x.\nSilver dragon offers us 15 Free Spins and multipliers of 5x, 8x, or 10x.\nPurple dragon offers us a random number of Free Spins and multipliers.\nBlue dragon offers us 13 Free Spins and multipliers of 8x, 10x, or 15x.\nYellow dragon offers us 10 Free Spins and multipliers of 10x, 15x, or 30x.\n\nGreen dragon offers us 6 Free Spins and multipliers of 15x, 30x, or 40x.\n\nIn conclusion, 8 Dragons is a delightful slot game that offers a wide range of betting options, great graphics, and a variety of bonuses that keep the gameplay exciting. Definitely recommended for experienced gamblers who are looking for something new and exciting.\n            ",
