The symbols that are part of the win are removed from the reels and new symbols drop down to replace them. Cascades will continue until you get winning combinations. This can lead to more wins in a single spin.\n\nAbove the reels, you will notice a row containing all regular symbols. At the start of each spin, the UFO hovers over the row and randomly selects a symbol. Then, all instances of the chosen symbol that appear on reels 2, 3, 4 or 5 become wilds for that spin and for any subsequent cascades.\n\nThe Mythical Unicow feature can increase the number of Megaways and provide from 168,070 to 1 million active paylines. It is triggered randomly on any base game spin by the second UFO with a cow pilot. When the Unicow appears, it will increase the number of symbols on all 6 reels, taking you to more Megaways.\n\nOn each free spin, one of the high-paying symbols will be randomly selected and become wild for the duration of that free spin. At the same time, the wild will come with a special modifier. Here's what you can get:\n\nInvaders Logo - expands to fill the entire reel and is counted as more ways to win in a winning combination;\nScientist - doubles the win multiplier on each cascade up to 256x;\nAlien - increases the number of symbols on that reel and adjacent reels, providing up to 1 million Megaways;\nCow - transforms all cow symbols into 2x wilds;\nX-ray gun - adds 1 X-ray gun symbol placed randomly, but not if the X-ray gun lands from a cascade.\n\nThe Free Spins feature can be reactivated by landing 3 or 4 extra scatters during the bonus round.

The reels are set on a farm and there is a farm in the background. There are crop signs that indicate that the aliens have already invaded the place, ready to deliver an exciting gaming adventure. Overall, it is a well-designed slot machine with high-quality graphics and rich graphics.\n\nThe payment symbols are divided into low and high-value symbols. Low-value symbols are drawn like real playing cards (9, 10, J, Q, K, and A) in different colors. They pay up to 0.28x your bet for 6 in a combination.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nThe Invaders Megaways slot offers some of the well-known features included in Megaways slots, plus some new ones. You'll find the classic Megaways engine with Cascading Reels, but also some innovative modifiers and a free spins feature with many extras.\n\nEvery time you get a winning combination, the Cascading Reels feature is activated. The symbols that are part of the win are removed from the reels and new symbols drop down to replace them. Cascades will continue until you get winning combinations. This can lead to more wins in a single spin.\n\nAbove the reels, you will notice a row containing all regular symbols. At the start of each spin, the UFO hovers over the row and randomly selects a symbol. Then, all instances of the chosen symbol that appear on reels 2, 3, 4 or 5 become wilds for that spin and for any subsequent cascades.\n\nThe Mythical Unicow feature can increase the number of Megaways and provide from 168,070 to 1 million active paylines. It is triggered randomly on any base game spin by the second UFO with a cow pilot. When the Unicow appears, it will increase the number of symbols on all 6 reels, taking you to more Megaways.\n\nOn each free spin, one of the high-paying symbols will be randomly selected and become wild for the duration of that free spin. At the same time, the wild will come with a special modifier. Here's what you can get:\n\nInvaders Logo - expands to fill the entire reel and is counted as more ways to win in a winning combination;\nScientist - doubles the win multiplier on each cascade up to 256x;\nAlien - increases the number of symbols on that reel and adjacent reels, providing up to 1 million Megaways;\nCow - transforms all cow symbols into 2x wilds;\nX-ray gun - adds 1 X-ray gun symbol placed randomly, but not if the X-ray gun lands from a cascade.\n\nThe Free Spins feature can be reactivated by landing 3 or 4 extra scatters during the bonus round. You can benefit from unlimited free spins.\n            ",

The game offers a total 1 million ways to win, which can bring a lot of excitement for players. Invaders Megaways is a highly volatile game with an RTP of 96.3%.\n\nAlien theme\n\nThe Invaders Megaways game is set on a farm and has an alien theme. The graphics and overall design of the game are impressive, with crop signs and excellent imagery. The payment symbols are divided into low-value and high-value symbols. Low-value symbols are real playing cards (9, 10, J, Q, K, and A) in different colors. The game also has a cow pilot in the game.\n\n1 million ways to win\n\nThe number of ways to win is randomly chosen on each spin and can reach an impressive 1 million. The more symbols that land on each of the 6 reels, the more Megaways are active. Winning combinations are created by landing 3 or more matching symbols or wilds on adjacent reels, starting from reel 1.\n\nUFO Wild Feature\n\nOn each spin, 1 symbol is randomly chosen by the UFO above the reels. All instances of this symbol that land on reels 2 to 5 become wilds, bringing the possibility of more wins in a single spin.\n\nUnicow feature\n\nThe Unicow feature can randomly increase the number of Megaways, up to 168,070 to the maximum 1 million active paylines, making the game even more exciting and providing even more opportunities for players to win.\n\nFree Spins round\n\nThe Free Spins feature is the main extra in Invaders Megaways. One of the high-value symbols is selected randomly to become wild for each free spin, and that wild comes with a special modifier. The feature can also be retriggered if players land 3 or 4 extra scatters during the bonus round. The unlimited free spin possibilities can lead to significant wins for lucky players.\n\nExcellent graphics and RTP of 96.3%\n\nInvaders Megaways offers a well-designed online slot game with high-quality graphics and rich graphics to further enhance the enjoyment of the game. The RTP of 96.3% is higher than the average of 96%, and the chance for significant wins on this highly volatile game with unlimited free spins is attractive to players looking for a thrilling gaming experience.\n\n        \n            ",

This UFO-themed adventure is packed with plenty of extras. On each spin, 1 symbol is randomly chosen. All instances of this symbol that land on reels 2 to 5 become wild. The Unicow mode can expand the reels and increase the number of Megaways between 168,070 and the magical 1 million. The main extra is the Free Spins feature with a special wild symbol. That wild also comes with modifiers. Find out more in our complete review of Invaders Megaways.\n\nWith 6 reels, the number of symbols landing on each reel changes on each spin. The more symbols there are, the more Megaways are active.\n\nAn extraterrestrial graphics\n\nOn the base game spins, between 2 and 7 symbols can appear on each reel giving you up to 117,649 Megaways. Winning combinations are created by landing 3 or more matching symbols or wilds on adjacent reels, starting from reel 1.\n\nYou can launch yourself into space with bet levels ranging from 10 cents to €10 per spin. Click on the coins icon to the right of the reels, then use the + and - tabs to adjust your bet. To open the paytable, click on the ? to the left of the reels.\n\nThe payment amounts are shown in cash and are adjusted as you change your bet. It's all nice and simple to follow. There is a simple Auto Play function where you can choose up to 100 autospins with single win and loss limits.\n\nThe RTP of Invaders Megaways is 96.3%, which is higher than the average of 96%. Highly volatile, the biggest wins will come from the Free Spins rounds, since you can play with up to 1 million Megaways and multipliers up to 256x. The maximum win is €250,000 per spin, which is the norm for WMS slots.\n\nAs we said above, the Invaders Megaways slot machine has an alien theme. The reels are set on a farm and there is a farm in the background. There are crop signs that indicate that the aliens have already invaded the place, ready to deliver an exciting gaming adventure. Overall, it is a well-designed slot machine with high-quality graphics and rich graphics.\n\nThe payment symbols are divided into low and high-value symbols. Low-value symbols are drawn like real playing cards (9, 10, J, Q, K, and A) in different colors. They pay up to 0.28x your bet for 6 in a combination.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nThe Invaders Megaways slot offers some of the well-known features included in Megaways slots, plus some new ones. You'll find the classic Megaways engine with Cascading Reels, but also some innovative modifiers and a free spins feature with many extras.\n\nEvery time you get a winning combination, the Cascading Reels feature is activated. The symbols that are part of the win are removed from the reels and new symbols drop down to replace them. Cascades will continue until you get winning combinations. This can lead to more wins in a single spin.\n\nAbove the reels, you will notice a row containing all regular symbols. At the start of each spin, the UFO hovers over the row and randomly selects a symbol. Then, all instances of the chosen symbol that appear on reels 2, 3, 4 or 5 become wilds for that spin and for any subsequent cascades.\n\nThe Mythical Unicow feature can increase the number of Megaways and provide from 168,070 to 1 million active paylines. It is triggered randomly on any base game spin by the second UFO with a cow pilot. When the Unicow appears, it will increase the number of symbols on all 6 reels, taking you to more Megaways.\n\nOn each free spin, one of the high-paying symbols will be randomly selected and become wild for the duration of that free spin. At the same time, the wild will come with a special modifier. Here's what you can get:\n\nInvaders Logo - expands to fill the entire reel and is counted as more ways to win in a winning combination;\nScientist - doubles the win multiplier on each cascade up to 256x;\nAlien - increases the number of symbols on that reel and adjacent reels, providing up to 1 million Megaways;\nCow - transforms all cow symbols into 2x wilds;\nX-ray gun - adds 1 X-ray gun symbol placed randomly, but not if the X-ray gun lands from a cascade.\n\nThe Free Spins feature can be reactivated by landing 3 or 4 extra scatters during the bonus round. You can benefit from unlimited free spins.\n            ",

They pay up to 0.28x your bet for 6 in a combination.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nThe Invaders Megaways slot offers some of the well-known features included in Megaways slots, plus some new ones. You'll find the classic Megaways engine with Cascading Reels, but also some innovative modifiers and a free spins feature with many extras.\n\nEvery time you get a winning combination, the Cascading Reels feature is activated. The symbols that are part of the win are removed from the reels and new symbols drop down to replace them. Cascades will continue until you get winning combinations. This can lead to more wins in a single spin.\n\nAbove the reels, you will notice a row containing all regular symbols. At the start of each spin, the UFO hovers over the row and randomly selects a symbol. Then, all instances of the chosen symbol that appear on reels 2, 3, 4 or 5 become wilds for that spin and for any subsequent cascades.\n\nThe Mythical Unicow feature can increase the number of Megaways and provide from 168,070 to 1 million active paylines. It is triggered randomly on any base game spin by the second UFO with a cow pilot. When the Unicow appears, it will increase the number of symbols on all 6 reels, taking you to more Megaways.\n\nOn each free spin, one of the high-paying symbols will be randomly selected and become wild for the duration of that free spin. At the same time, the wild will come with a special modifier. Here's what you can get:\n\nInvaders Logo - expands to fill the entire reel and is counted as more ways to win in a winning combination;\nScientist - doubles the win multiplier on each cascade up to 256x;\nAlien - increases the number of symbols on that reel and adjacent reels, providing up to 1 million Megaways;\nCow - transforms all cow symbols into 2x wilds;\nX-ray gun - adds 1 X-ray gun symbol placed randomly, but not if the X-ray gun lands from a cascade.\n\nThe Free Spins feature can be reactivated by landing 3 or 4 extra scatters during the bonus round. You can benefit from unlimited free spins.\n            ",
