The slot's title and the symbols found within it are clearly inspired by the fantastic world, showing horses with fiery manes and phoenixes trapped in crystal spheres.\nBy doing so, the slot is certainly more anonymous than others that can boast titles inspired by film or literary works but gets in return for originality that spreads to the game mechanisms themselves.\nFrom a sound point of view, the music only activates when we spin the various reels, while the pauses between plays are accompanied by the crackle of flames and the neighing of horses, just mentioned.\nFire Queen: How to play\nWe come to the most interesting but also difficult aspect to tackle when talking about Fire Queen by WMS. The game grid, in fact, is certainly unique in its kind, which could scare us at first and require a few plays to really get used to it.\nWe will try to explain it as simply as possible: in the case of Fire Queen, it is as if we were facing two slots with 50 paylines each.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics\n\nFire Queen by WMS has a unique game grid that is certainly different from other slot games. The game grid can be thought of as two slots with 50 paylines each, and each slot follows its respective reels except for the three reels at the center, which are common to both slots. Combinations can even start in the upper slot and end in the lower one. The game has 22 symbols and features a very high number of paylines.\n\nVisuals and theme\n\nThe slot game Fire Queen by WMS does not use a specific theme but instead shows graphics inspired by the fantastic world. Symbols in the game include horses with fiery manes and phoenixes trapped in crystal spheres. The music in the game only activates when the reels are spinning, while the pauses between plays are accompanied by the crackle of flames and the neighing of horses.\n\nPaylines and reels\n\nFire Queen has a game grid that is definitely unique. The slot features two slots with 50 paylines each, and the three reels at the center are shared by both slots. Fire Queen offers 22 symbols and a high number of paylines, allowing for interesting combinations.\n\nSuitability for traditional players\n\nFire Queen by WMS is not an ideal slot game for those who prefer traditional gameplay, as the game features a unique game grid and mechanism. Players who are willing to dedicate some time to learn completely different mechanics may appreciate the unique slots for its originality.\n\nSimilar games\n\nOther slot games that offer multiple game grids simultaneously include WMG's 4 Fowl Play and Fowl Play Gold or Playtech's Tropic Reel, Ocean Princess, and Goblins Cave. These games may also feature the Multi Spin mechanic that allows players to spin the reels twice in the same play and offer players a unique gameplay experience.\n\n        \n            ",

The game grid features two separate sets of reels with three reels on the right, common to both, and the two initial reels separated. The slot's unique mechanism creates intriguing interactions between the slots, with various combinations of symbols landing across 22 symbols and a high number of paylines.\n\nVisuals\n\nFire Queen by WMS features symbols depicting a fantastic world with horses with fiery manes and phoenixes captured in crystal spheres. The slot's graphics do not revolve around any particular theme, giving it a more anonymous feel than other more explicitly themed slots. The game's sound effects are sparse, with music only playing during active spins, and pause sounds like crackling flames and the neighing of horses.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols in Fire Queen by WMS depict a fantasy world with horses that have fiery manes and phoenixes enclosed in crystal spheres. There are standard playing card symbols, but the majority of the symbols are unique to the game, with the highest paying being the Fire Queen herself. Winning combinations can be created from either set of reels, with a variety of special symbols included to help boost payouts.\n\nAlternative Titles\n\nAlthough Fire Queen is a unique slot in terms of its gameplay, there are a few titles that feature a similar multiple grid system or innovative gameplay mechanics. WMG provides 4 Fowl Play and Fowl Play Gold with a similar grid system, while Playtech offers multi-spin slots like Tropic Reel, Ocean Princess, and Goblins Cave.\n\nSuitability for Traditional Players\n\nFire Queen's gameplay is not ideal for those who prefer a more traditional approach to slots and do not want to dedicate time to learn an entirely different game mechanism. However, for those who are bored with the typical slots available online, Fire Queen is an excellent game to try out. This slot is suitable for those who enjoy innovative gameplay mechanics that offer great potential for interesting winning combinations.\n\n        \n            ",

Fire Queen by WMS tries to follow both paths at the same time, as we will see in this dedicated review of this title.\nThere is much to say, especially regarding the game mechanics, so let's get started.\nFire Queen: Visuals\nThe slot does not use a specific theme for its graphics. The slot's title and the symbols found within it are clearly inspired by the fantastic world, showing horses with fiery manes and phoenixes trapped in crystal spheres.\nBy doing so, the slot is certainly more anonymous than others that can boast titles inspired by film or literary works but gets in return for originality that spreads to the game mechanisms themselves.\nFrom a sound point of view, the music only activates when we spin the various reels, while the pauses between plays are accompanied by the crackle of flames and the neighing of horses, just mentioned.\nFire Queen: How to play\nWe come to the most interesting but also difficult aspect to tackle when talking about Fire Queen by WMS. The game grid, in fact, is certainly unique in its kind, which could scare us at first and require a few plays to really get used to it.\nWe will try to explain it as simply as possible: in the case of Fire Queen, it is as if we were facing two slots with 50 paylines each. The three reels on the right, in fact, are common to both slots, while the two initial reels are separated from each other.\nObviously, summarizing a slot of this type in this way is very limiting, as the most interesting aspect is precisely the interaction that is created between the two slots, with combinations that can start in the upper slot and end in the lower one.\nJust to give an idea of how different this mechanism is from normality, the most common game grid features five reels and three symbols on each of them, showing in fact fifteen symbols for each play. In the case of Fire Queen, 22 symbols are shown, and the very high number of paylines allows for very interesting combinations.\nPrecisely for this reason, this slot is not suitable for those who prefer a more traditional approach and do not want to dedicate part of their time to learning a completely different mechanism, but is recommended for those who are tired of always seeing the same slots proposed online.\nA title that is certainly unique in its kind, which in fact makes the last point of this review more difficult.\nSimilar titles to Fire Queen\nAlthough the mechanism of this slot is unique, there are other solutions that allow you to use more game grids simultaneously and try out a gameplay that is unique in its kind. WMG, for example, with 4 Fowl Play and Fowl Play Gold, or you can try the Multi Spin mechanic (i.e., spinning the reels twice in the same play), common in this development house and in Playtech, with titles such as Tropic Reel, Ocean Princess, or Goblins Cave.\n            ",

Fire Queen by WMS tries to follow both paths at the same time, as we will see in this dedicated review of this title.\nThere is much to say, especially regarding the game mechanics, so let's get started.\nFire Queen: Visuals\nThe slot does not use a specific theme for its graphics. The slot's title and the symbols found within it are clearly inspired by the fantastic world, showing horses with fiery manes and phoenixes trapped in crystal spheres.\nBy doing so, the slot is certainly more anonymous than others that can boast titles inspired by film or literary works but gets in return for originality that spreads to the game mechanisms themselves.\nFrom a sound point of view, the music only activates when we spin the various reels, while the pauses between plays are accompanied by the crackle of flames and the neighing of horses, just mentioned.\nFire Queen: How to play\nWe come to the most interesting but also difficult aspect to tackle when talking about Fire Queen by WMS. The game grid, in fact, is certainly unique in its kind, which could scare us at first and require a few plays to really get used to it.\nWe will try to explain it as simply as possible: in the case of Fire Queen, it is as if we were facing two slots with 50 paylines each. The three reels on the right, in fact, are common to both slots, while the two initial reels are separated from each other.\nObviously, summarizing a slot of this type in this way is very limiting, as the most interesting aspect is precisely the interaction that is created between the two slots, with combinations that can start in the upper slot and end in the lower one.\nJust to give an idea of how different this mechanism is from normality, the most common game grid features five reels and three symbols on each of them, showing in fact fifteen symbols for each play. In the case of Fire Queen, 22 symbols are shown, and the very high number of paylines allows for very interesting combinations.\nPrecisely for this reason, this slot is not suitable for those who prefer a more traditional approach and do not want to dedicate part of their time to learning a completely different mechanism, but is recommended for those who are tired of always seeing the same slots proposed online.\nA title that is certainly unique in its kind, which in fact makes the last point of this review more difficult.\nSimilar titles to Fire Queen\nAlthough the mechanism of this slot is unique, there are other solutions that allow you to use more game grids simultaneously and try out a gameplay that is unique in its kind. WMG, for example, with 4 Fowl Play and Fowl Play Gold, or you can try the Multi Spin mechanic (i.e., spinning the reels twice in the same play), common in this development house and in Playtech, with titles such as Tropic Reel, Ocean Princess, or Goblins Cave.\n        ",
