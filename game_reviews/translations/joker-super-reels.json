Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Grids and Paylines\n\nJoker Super Reels has two grids: the regular gameplay grid with three reels and three lines, and a 3x4 upper section that can be activated through winnings. There are five fixed paylines, but the bonus game can go up to 64. The minimum bet is €0.10, and the maximum is €25. There is also an autoplay feature that allows you to select between five and 100 autospins. Overall, the game is suitable for all types of players.\n\nSymbols and Bonuses\n\nIn the basic game, Joker Super Reels features classic fruit symbols, a star symbol that pays up to 20 times the stake value, and a Wild jester symbol that replaces all other symbols. In the Super Game, additional symbols like strawberries, watermelons, bells, and the number 7 are introduced. If three jesters appear in either the regular game or the Super Game, you can win a whopping 2,000 coins. To activate the Super Game, the counter placed on the top part of the grid must reach at least 50.\n\nRegular versus Super Game\n\nJoker Super Reels has two game modes: the regular gameplay mode and the Super Game. The Super Game is activated once you've reached a certain level of winnings, as indicated by the counter on the top part of the screen. While the regular game features classic fruit symbols, the Super Game introduces new symbols and offers the chance to win additional prizes. The Wild jester symbol also rewards a random prize between 100 and 2,000 coins in the Super Game.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nJoker Super Reels has high volatility and an RTP of 96.08%. This makes it a respectable contender in the online slot game scene. While high volatility means that wins may be infrequent, they are usually significant. Players should consider this when selecting their bets, but overall, the game offers a fair chance of winning.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nJoker Super Reels is an excellent throwback slot game that combines nostalgic vibes with thrilling bonus features. Its retro design may appeal to more traditional players, while the added bonuses cater to modern gamers. The game's minimum bet of €0.10 and maximum of €25 makes it suitable for all types of players, from first-timers to seasoned pros. Overall, anyone looking for a fun and exciting online slot experience should consider giving Joker Super Reels a spin!\n\n        \n            ",

But Reelplay's Joker Super Reels is here to give you a blast from the past with its retro design and added exciting bonuses that cater even to modern gamers. \n\nAs the game screen appears, you'll see the slot machine front and center in a casino ambiance. There are two grids: one for regular gameplay and another that can be activated once you've reached a certain level of winnings, as indicated by the counter on the top part of the screen. On the right side, you can adjust your bets and winnings, while on the left, you can start the game, choose the autoplay feature, and activate the special game mode. The arcade background music accompanies the spinning sound, with a triumphant march playing after significant wins. The winning combinations and symbols' respective values are displayed in the upper part of the console.\n\nHere are the game's primary features:\n\nThe regular gameplay grid has three reels and three lines, while the upper section is a 3x4. There are five fixed paylines, but the bonus game can go up to 64. The minimum bet is €0.10, and the maximum is €25, making it ideal for all types of players, from the seasoned pros to the first-timers. You can also select between five and 100 autospins. Additionally, you can switch the right and left buttons' positions, which is especially useful for left-handed gamers. This slot has high volatility and an RTP of 96.08%, making it a respectable contender in the online slot game scene.\n\nThe game symbols and Joker Super Reels' functionality:\n\nIn the basic game, you'll find classic fruit symbols such as cherries, lemons, plums, and oranges. There's also a star symbol that can pay out up to 20 times the stake value. In the Super Game, there are additional symbols like strawberries, watermelons, bells, and the number 7. The jester symbol is the Wild, and it replaces all other symbols, but only during the main game. In the Super Game, it rewards a random prize between 100 and 2,000 coins. If three jesters appear in either the regular game or the Super Game, you can win a whopping 2,000 coins. \n\nTo activate the Super Game, the counter placed on the top part of the grid must reach at least 50. However, you can still play with this special feature even if the counter reaches a level of 100 or 200. \n\nIn conclusion, Joker Super Reels is an excellent throwback slot game that combines nostalgic vibes with thrilling bonus features, making it a fantastic choice for both traditional and modern players.
