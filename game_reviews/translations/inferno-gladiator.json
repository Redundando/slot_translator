We're talking about Inferno Gladiator, a slot that develops a beloved theme, namely that of the legendary ancient Roman slave battles. The story is developed by Gong Gaming Technologies, which is ready to launch this slot on all online casinos powered by Microgaming.\n\nAt the center of our scene we have the Colosseum of a stunning Rome, a series of good features and an interesting gameplay structure. We have in fact a grid formed by a classic 5x3, 25 paylines and a slightly contained RTP, which stops at 95.04%. According to the provider's promised numbers, the slot can potentially give the player 2,000x the bet placed.\n\nSlot Graphics\nWe've talked about Rome, gladiators and battles, but how is it all represented? Drawing inspiration from the world of many books, movies and TV series: the result is a good and well-crafted design, not the best overall but certainly positive. The story is also told through its symbols, which do not give up the Royal cards and high value symbols ranging from ferocious beasts, helmets, horses, shields, tridents and images of the Colosseum. But the excellent work done is what can be admired in the amount of interaction that begins with regular Scatters and Wilds, capable of making even free spins with increasing multipliers and fixed Wilds exciting.\n\nFeatures and Functionality\nAs mentioned, we have 25 active lines on Inferno Gladiator where we can earn, in the luckiest of scenarios, up to 250,000 in jackpot. Clearly only if you bet with the maximum bet level. Let's see how the extra features can interact!\n\nThe Wild symbol of the base game is a gold and pink shield with the slot's logo: it is used as a substitute for any other game icon. Alongside it is a Scatter with the logo of the free spins and the Colosseum. This is the symbol that can give the most satisfaction, because if it lands 3 to 5 times, the online slot will reward you with 10 free spins. At that point, you will find a fixed Wild at the center of reel number 3 that will remain until the end of this feature. Finally, we find a multiplier that increases by +1 for each new spin, so as to reach the end with a 10x multiplier.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Slot\nWe had the opportunity to try Inferno Gladiator and given the great presentations from its provider, perhaps something more was expected. Don't get us wrong, it's a good slot, composed of all the features necessary to ensure entertainment and fun, but something is missing.

We're talking about Inferno Gladiator, a slot that develops a beloved theme, namely that of the legendary ancient Roman slave battles. The story is developed by Gong Gaming Technologies, which is ready to launch this slot on all online casinos powered by Microgaming.\n\nAt the center of our scene we have the Colosseum of a stunning Rome, a series of good features and an interesting gameplay structure. We have in fact a grid formed by a classic 5x3, 25 paylines and a slightly contained RTP, which stops at 95.04%. According to the provider's promised numbers, the slot can potentially give the player 2,000x the bet placed.\n\nSlot Graphics\nWe've talked about Rome, gladiators and battles, but how is it all represented? Drawing inspiration from the world of many books, movies and TV series: the result is a good and well-crafted design, not the best overall but certainly positive. The story is also told through its symbols, which do not give up the Royal cards and high value symbols ranging from ferocious beasts, helmets, horses, shields, tridents and images of the Colosseum. But the excellent work done is what can be admired in the amount of interaction that begins with regular Scatters and Wilds, capable of making even free spins with increasing multipliers and fixed Wilds exciting.\n\nFeatures and Functionality\nAs mentioned, we have 25 active lines on Inferno Gladiator where we can earn, in the luckiest of scenarios, up to 250,000 in jackpot. Clearly only if you bet with the maximum bet level. Let's see how the extra features can interact!\n\nThe Wild symbol of the base game is a gold and pink shield with the slot's logo: it is used as a substitute for any other game icon. Alongside it is a Scatter with the logo of the free spins and the Colosseum. This is the symbol that can give the most satisfaction, because if it lands 3 to 5 times, the online slot will reward you with 10 free spins. At that point, you will find a fixed Wild at the center of reel number 3 that will remain until the end of this feature. Finally, we find a multiplier that increases by +1 for each new spin, so as to reach the end with a 10x multiplier.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Slot\nWe had the opportunity to try Inferno Gladiator and given the great presentations from its provider, perhaps something more was expected. Don't get us wrong, it's a good slot, composed of all the features necessary to ensure entertainment and fun, but something is missing. In essence, it's like a comedian who makes you smile, but doesn't completely thrill you. It's still worth trying because the theme and design are enjoyable.\n            ",

The game offers a potential win of up to 2,000x the bet placed. The base game features a Wild symbol, which can be used as a substitute for any other game icon. The game also features a Scatter symbol that can trigger the free spins round where players can win up to 10 free spins with a fixed Wild at the center of reel number 3 and a multiplier that increases by +1 for each new spin, up to 10x.\n\nTheme and design\n\nInferno Gladiator has a theme based on ancient Roman slave battles. The game features symbols such as ferocious beasts, helmets, horses, shields, tridents, and images of the Colosseum. The graphics are well-crafted and draw inspiration from books, movies, and TV series. The design of the game is positive overall, with good interaction between regular Scatters and Wilds.\n\nJackpot and win potential\n\nThe maximum jackpot that can be won on Inferno Gladiator is 250,000, but this is only possible if the maximum bet level is placed. Nonetheless, the game offers potential winnings of up to 2,000x the bet placed, which is a decent amount. Players should keep in mind that the RTP of the game is quite low at 95.04%.\n\nAvailability on online casinos\n\nInferno Gladiator is developed by Gong Gaming Technologies and will be available on all online casinos powered by Microgaming. Players can look forward to playing this game on a range of different online casinos.\n\nOverall impression and shortcomings\n\nInferno Gladiator is a good slot game overall, with all the features necessary to ensure players are entertained. However, given the hype surrounding the game, some players may find it falls short of expectations. The theme and design of the game are enjoyable, and there are good interactions between the regular Scatters and Wilds. However, there is something that is missing to make this game truly stand out. Players should also keep in mind that the RTP of the game is low at 95.04%.\n\n        \n            ",

We're talking about Inferno Gladiator, a slot that develops a beloved theme, namely that of the legendary ancient Roman slave battles. The story is developed by Gong Gaming Technologies, which is ready to launch this slot on all online casinos powered by Microgaming.\n\nAt the center of our scene we have the Colosseum of a stunning Rome, a series of good features and an interesting gameplay structure. We have in fact a grid formed by a classic 5x3, 25 paylines and a slightly contained RTP, which stops at 95.04%. According to the provider's promised numbers, the slot can potentially give the player 2,000x the bet placed.\n\nSlot Graphics\nWe've talked about Rome, gladiators and battles, but how is it all represented? Drawing inspiration from the world of many books, movies and TV series: the result is a good and well-crafted design, not the best overall but certainly positive. The story is also told through its symbols, which do not give up the Royal cards and high value symbols ranging from ferocious beasts, helmets, horses, shields, tridents and images of the Colosseum. But the excellent work done is what can be admired in the amount of interaction that begins with regular Scatters and Wilds, capable of making even free spins with increasing multipliers and fixed Wilds exciting.\n\nFeatures and Functionality\nAs mentioned, we have 25 active lines on Inferno Gladiator where we can earn, in the luckiest of scenarios, up to 250,000 in jackpot. Clearly only if you bet with the maximum bet level. Let's see how the extra features can interact!\n\nThe Wild symbol of the base game is a gold and pink shield with the slot's logo: it is used as a substitute for any other game icon. Alongside it is a Scatter with the logo of the free spins and the Colosseum. This is the symbol that can give the most satisfaction, because if it lands 3 to 5 times, the online slot will reward you with 10 free spins. At that point, you will find a fixed Wild at the center of reel number 3 that will remain until the end of this feature. Finally, we find a multiplier that increases by +1 for each new spin, so as to reach the end with a 10x multiplier.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Slot\nWe had the opportunity to try Inferno Gladiator and given the great presentations from its provider, perhaps something more was expected. Don't get us wrong, it's a good slot, composed of all the features necessary to ensure entertainment and fun, but something is missing. In essence, it's like a comedian who makes you smile, but doesn't completely thrill you. It's still worth trying because the theme and design are enjoyable.\n            ",
