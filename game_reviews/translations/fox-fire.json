Thanks to the Ways Out Ways function and the stunning design, you can make truly special bets!\n\nMain symbols of Fox Fire\nApart from Wild and Scatter, the symbols in this slot are all beautiful, brightly colored precious stones that offer some generous rewards.\n\nThe Wild symbol is simply the word WILD in purple and gold and can substitute for any other symbol to help you get higher winning combinations. The Wild can appear on reels 2, 3 and 4 plus reel 5 when that reel has been activated by the Ways Out Ways feature;\nThe Scatter symbol takes the form of the Arctic fox. If it appears on a reel, it will expand to 7 rows with the Ways Out Ways feature, which we will discuss in more detail below.\n\nHow to play Fox Fire?\n\nCheck the rules and paytable before starting to spin the slot, to make sure you know how to move. If you are satisfied with the regulations, you can switch to modifying the value of your bet by clicking on the BET button in the bottom of the controls on the right. Remember, by adjusting your bet halfway through the game, you will reset your Ways Out Ways progress;\nAfter setting your bet, you can click the large arrow in the middle right of the screen to spin the reels once or choose the smaller button to set AutoSpins and limits;\nDuring the game, you can keep an eye on your balance and winnings by checking the sections below the reels.\n\nBet sizes and paytable\nYou can place your bet anywhere from 25 to 2,500 credits in this game, with a multiplier that increases as you increase your play to offer you greater winnings. Symbols will pay out from 3 to 6 matching combinations starting from the far left reel, and the Wild can substitute for any symbol to help you reach richer winning combinations. The maximum prize for each symbol is as follows:\n\nFox: 250x\nCluster of red or green precious stones: 100x\nCluster of blue or pink precious stones: 80x\nSingle gem of a coordinated color: 10x\n\nWays Out Ways Bonus Feature\nFox Fire does not offer a bonus round of free spins, but you can increase your chances of winning by landing the fox symbols on a reel to activate the extra rows and increase the available winning modes in the game. The activated reels expand to include one more position per spin up to a maximum of 7 rows. After reaching the maximum of seven, the reel will shrink back to its original three spaces. Above each reel, you will also notice a meter with segments that will fill up each time you reach the maximum seven positions available on that reel. Once the segment has been fully filled, the reel will contain all 7 symbols for the next five spins before starting over again.\n\nVery positive verdict!\nIn conclusion, I really enjoyed playing Fox Fire even with real money, as it is a slot with absolutely wonderful design, with music and the general atmosphere created by High 5 incredibly enjoyable. The high volatility certainly doesn't help to achieve big wins, but thanks to the reel with the Ways Out Ways function activated on almost every spin, winnings can grow. The unique design and such smooth gameplay really won me over and I will be happy to play it again! If you liked Fox Fire, you might also take a look at other fun free slots in our library that feature a fox, I recommend 2 of my favorites:\n\nhttps://www.slotjava.it/slot/polar-fox/\nhttps://www.slotjava.it/slot/foxin-twins/\n            ",
