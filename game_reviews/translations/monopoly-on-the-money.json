Con Monopoly On The Money hai la possibilità di rivivere parte della grande emozione che respiravi con il gioco da tavolo, lasciandoti trasportare dal lavoro svolto da Barcrest. La casa di produzione ha deciso di presentare una slot online dall’aspetto minimal, con una griglia di 5 rulli e 10 linee di pagamento. Il gameplay è pulito, semplice e diventa accattivante nel momento in cui potrai beneficiare della Funzione Free Spin, capace di regalare fino a 50 giri gratuiti. Altrettanto simpatica è l’idea di offrire al giocatore una serie di Big Bet per partecipare a giochi aggiuntivi partendo da una scommessa di 20, 30, 40 o 50 monete, effettuando dei giri a parte. In base alla scelta che farai cambiano le regole di ogni bonus game e potrai espandere le linee di pagamento per aumentare le tue possibilità di vincita. Vediamo da vicino che cosa ha preparato per noi Barcrest con questa slot che ha un RTP pari al 97,5%.\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nLa grafica lascia un po’ a desiderare: siamo su uno schermo completamente nero al centro del quale si posiziona la nostra griglia di gioco. Abbiamo dei rulli rossi che sono animati da simboli classici del gioco come i Bigliettoni di denaro, il Cane, il Gatto, il Cappello d’oro e le immancabili carte da gioco reali che sono A, K, Q, J e 10. Aggiungiamo anche l’icona Monopoly On The Money che sborsa fino a 20 volte la tua scommessa se appare però 5 volte su una linea di pagamento.\nPassiamo poi alla funzione giri gratuiti che si sblocca quando ottieni 3 o più Scatter, rappresentati con il simbolo ‘Go’. Se trovi 3, 4 o 5 icone ottieni rispettivamente 8, 20 o 50 giri free. Considera che prima di terminare questa funzione potrai decidere se scommettere ulteriormente per vincere più giri o semplicemente continuare a giocare con quelli che hai a disposizione. Pensa bene al da farsi, poiché puoi vincere fino a 25 giri extra per volta!\nMa vediamo le modalità Big Bet:\n • Se scommetti 20 puoi avere 5 giri con lo Scatter che agiscono come Jolly che si fissa sulla griglia;\n• Chi scommette 30 potrà sfruttare 5 giri dove lo Scatter diventa Wild e si fissa anche se attivi la funzione Free Spin. In questa fase puoi anche sbloccare la funzione Red Hot Respin e trovare il fortunato terzo Scatter.\n• Se scommetti 40 puoi incontrare la funzione House Extension per scoprire così l’estensione dei rulli e le maggiori possibilità di vittoria;\n• Infine chi scommette 50 potrà giocare con rulli estesi di 2 linee.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Monopoly on the Money\nMonopoly On The Money si presenta come un gioco semplice ma con un aspetto inaspettato rispetto al gameplay. In realtà è molto intuitivo e può regalare qualche soddisfazione da non dimenticare grazie ai suoi Jolly che si fissano sulla griglia. Nel complesso è piacevole da giocare e offre vincite massime fino a 500 volte la tua scommessa per ogni giro, dettaglio da non sottovalutare!\n",

But now, with Monopoly On The Money, Barcrest has brought that excitement to the online slot game world. The minimalistic design features 5 reels with 10 paylines, creating a clean and simple gameplay that becomes captivating when triggering the Free Spin function, which can give you up to 50 free spins. Another great feature is the Big Bet, where players can participate in additional games starting from a bet of 20, 30, 40 or 50 coins, giving you a chance to expand the paylines and increase your chances of winning big.\n\nLet's take a closer look at what Barcrest has prepared for us with this slot game, which has an RTP of 97.5%.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nThe graphics might leave you wanting more, as the entire screen is black with the game grid in the center. However, the red reels are animated with classic symbols from the game, such as money bills, a dog, a cat, a hat, and royal playing cards, including A, K, Q, J, and 10. Additionally, the Monopoly On The Money icon pays up to 20 times your bet if it appears 5 times on a payline.\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nIn order to trigger the free spins feature, you need to get 3 or more Scatter symbols represented by the 'Go' symbol. If you get 3, 4 or 5 icons, you will receive 8, 20 or 50 free spins respectively. Before ending the feature, you can choose to bet more to win extra spins or simply continue playing with the spins you have. Keep in mind that you can win up to 25 extra spins at a time!\n\nBig Bet Feature\n\nThe Big Bet feature is where things start to get really exciting. With a bet of 20, you can have 5 spins with the Scatter acting as a Wild, sticking to the grid. A bet of 30 will give you 5 spins with the Scatter becoming Wild and sticking in place even if the Free Spin feature is activated. During this phase, you can also unlock the Red Hot Respin feature and find the lucky third Scatter. Bet 40 and discover the House Extension feature, where the grid expands and gives you more chances to win. Finally, with a bet of 50, you'll be able to play with 2 extra rows on the reels.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMonopoly On The Money may seem simple, but its surprising features and intuitive gameplay can bring great satisfaction to even the most experienced gamblers. Don't underestimate the power of the Sticky Wilds either, as they can contribute to maximum wins of up to 500 times your bet per spin!",

The graphics might be minimalistic, but the animated classic symbols are recognizable and the Monopoly On The Money icon pays up to 20 times your bet if it appears 5 times on a payline. With an RTP of 97.5% and maximum wins of up to 500 times your bet per spin, Monopoly On The Money can bring great satisfaction to even the most experienced gamblers.\n        ",

But now, with Monopoly On The Money, Barcrest has brought that excitement to the online slot game world. The minimalistic design features 5 reels with 10 paylines, creating a clean and simple gameplay that becomes captivating when triggering the Free Spin function, which can give you up to 50 free spins. Another great feature is the Big Bet, where players can participate in additional games starting from a bet of 20, 30, 40 or 50 coins, giving you a chance to expand the paylines and increase your chances of winning big.\n\nLet's take a closer look at what Barcrest has prepared for us with this slot game, which has an RTP of 97.5%.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nThe graphics might leave you wanting more, as the entire screen is black with the game grid in the center. However, the red reels are animated with classic symbols from the game, such as money bills, a dog, a cat, a hat, and royal playing cards, including A, K, Q, J, and 10. Additionally, the Monopoly On The Money icon pays up to 20 times your bet if it appears 5 times on a payline.\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nIn order to trigger the free spins feature, you need to get 3 or more Scatter symbols represented by the 'Go' symbol.

With a bet of 20, you can have 5 spins with the Scatter acting as a Wild, sticking to the grid. A bet of 30 will give you 5 spins with the Scatter becoming Wild and sticking in place even if the Free Spin feature is activated. During this phase, you can also unlock the Red Hot Respin feature and find the lucky third Scatter. Bet 40 and discover the House Extension feature, where the grid expands and gives you more chances to win. Finally, with a bet of 50, you'll be able to play with 2 extra rows on the reels.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMonopoly On The Money may seem simple, but its surprising features and intuitive gameplay can bring great satisfaction to even the most experienced gamblers.

But now, with Monopoly On The Money, Barcrest has brought that excitement to the online slot game world. The minimalistic design features 5 reels with 10 paylines, creating a clean and simple gameplay that becomes captivating when triggering the Free Spin function, which can give you up to 50 free spins. Another great feature is the Big Bet, where players can participate in additional games starting from a bet of 20, 30, 40 or 50 coins, giving you a chance to expand the paylines and increase your chances of winning big.\n\nLet's take a closer look at what Barcrest has prepared for us with this slot game, which has an RTP of 97.5%.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nThe graphics might leave you wanting more, as the entire screen is black with the game grid in the center. However, the red reels are animated with classic symbols from the game, such as money bills, a dog, a cat, a hat, and royal playing cards, including A, K, Q, J, and 10. Additionally, the Monopoly On The Money icon pays up to 20 times your bet if it appears 5 times on a payline.\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nIn order to trigger the free spins feature, you need to get 3 or more Scatter symbols represented by the 'Go' symbol. If you get 3, 4 or 5 icons, you will receive 8, 20 or 50 free spins respectively. Before ending the feature, you can choose to bet more to win extra spins or simply continue playing with the spins you have. Keep in mind that you can win up to 25 extra spins at a time!\n\nBig Bet Feature\n\nThe Big Bet feature is where things start to get really exciting. With a bet of 20, you can have 5 spins with the Scatter acting as a Wild, sticking to the grid. A bet of 30 will give you 5 spins with the Scatter becoming Wild and sticking in place even if the Free Spin feature is activated. During this phase, you can also unlock the Red Hot Respin feature and find the lucky third Scatter. Bet 40 and discover the House Extension feature, where the grid expands and gives you more chances to win. Finally, with a bet of 50, you'll be able to play with 2 extra rows on the reels.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMonopoly On The Money may seem simple, but its surprising features and intuitive gameplay can bring great satisfaction to even the most experienced gamblers. Don't underestimate the power of the Sticky Wilds either, as they can contribute to maximum wins of up to 500 times your bet per spin!\n        ",
