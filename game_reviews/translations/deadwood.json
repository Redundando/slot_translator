The Tombstone slot sequel has an RTP of 96.02% and a maximum win of 13,950x your bet.\n\nDeadwood is a video slot in a 3-4-4-4-3 format with 576 ways to win. Payments are awarded for three or five matching symbols on adjacent reels only from left to right. You can join the gunslingers on desktop or mobile from 0.20 to 100 credits per spin. The game has the maximum volatility (10/10) with an RTP range of 96.02 - 96.03%.\n \nAs you load the game, you'll see yourself entering Main Street of the Wild West town alongside your three gunslingers companions. You might stop at the Deadwood saloon for a hearty meal that will give you energy before going hunting with the outlaws. A metal frame holds the bigger reel set that's now three and four rows tall. Each of the three bounty hunters commands their own reel, providing increasing multipliers as they move in full view.\n \nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n \nThe Deadwood slot has plenty of bonus features. You have the Hunter xNudge Wild feature, which sees the wild bounty hunter push to become fully visible and increase the multiplier on each spin. Sheriff badges also trigger the Shoot Out feature, where low-value symbols turn into wilds. Then there are 3 Free Spins features. One of them sees the Hunter xNudge Wild feature trigger on every free spin. The Gunslinger Spins feature sees the multiplier increase infinitely. The best one is the Shoot Out Free Spins feature, where Sheriff badges are locked in place so that the Shoot Out feature applies on every Free Spin.\n\nThere are three bounty hunters in the Deadwood Slot. They allow you to win up to 4 Free Spins and appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. When they appear, you must hope they keep coming on every spin. With each appearance of a bounty hunter, the Wild multiplier increases by 1x. If multiple Wild multipliers appear, they are added together for a total Wild multiplier. Wilds substitute for all symbols except the Scatter and Sheriff badge symbols.\n \nBeware of the Sheriff badge symbol. When the Sheriff badge symbol appears on both reels 1 and 5 in the base game, the Shoot Out feature is triggered. All low-value symbols on the 3 middle reels will turn into Wild symbols.\n\nThe most important symbol is the Scatter. 3 of them appearing simultaneously give you the chance to choose between 2 and 8 Free Spins.\n \nHunter Spins feature: with 8 spins awarded to the hunter, at least 1 Hunter Wild is guaranteed to land on every Free Spin. This triggers the Hunter xNudge Wild feature with multipliers. Sheriff badges can also land with the addition of 1 extra spin to what you already have.\n \nGunslinger Spins feature: with 8 gun spins awarded, this is a more volatile option. You challenge the gunslingers head-on and try to win the unlimited win multiplier that remains for the entire feature. Any landing with a Hunter Wild symbol triggers the unlimited win multiplier. Every landing with the Sheriff badge gives you 1 extra Free Spin every time.\n \nSimilar Slot Machines\n \nBooming Games has developed a serious Wild West themed slot that brings the best of this genre's features and does a few more things to improve your chances of a big win.\n \nGunspinner has a layout of three rows and five reels. So far, nothing different from the standard. Symbols spin on 20 always-active paylines and are divided into high-value and low-value symbols. There is a Wild symbol that can replace any other symbol except bonus symbols. In addition to this, the Wild can also bring multipliers to your winnings.\n            ",

The sequel to Tombstone will take you to the infamous town of Deadwood, a den of feared outlaws known for their daring heists and wild shootouts. Join the three bounty hunters as they chase their next outlaw with the xNudge Wilds feature and a flurry of Free Spins features with progressive multipliers and other modifiers that can lead to wins up to 13,950 times your bet.\n\nAre you ready to withstand the chaos and lawlessness between the Deadwood reels in an attempt to cash in on the maximum reward of 13,950 times your bet? Enjoy the fast-paced gameplay of the Wild West, the multiple bonus features, stacked wilds, and increasing multipliers.\n \nGraphics for Wild West enthusiasts\n \nThe Deadwood slot is a 5-reel, 576 ways to win game, powered by Nolimit City. Available to play on all devices starting at 20 cents per spin, this Wild West themed slot features Hunter xNudge Wilds that expand and increase the multiplier on every spin. There is a Shoot Out feature where low-value symbols act as wilds. Then there are 3 Free Spins features where the 2 above-mentioned features apply. In the Shoot Out Free Spins feature, Sheriff badges lock in place to guarantee Shoot Out feature triggers. The Tombstone slot sequel has an RTP of 96.02% and a maximum win of 13,950x your bet.\n\nDeadwood is a video slot in a 3-4-4-4-3 format with 576 ways to win. Payments are awarded for three or five matching symbols on adjacent reels only from left to right. You can join the gunslingers on desktop or mobile from 0.20 to 100 credits per spin. The game has the maximum volatility (10/10) with an RTP range of 96.02 - 96.03%.\n \nAs you load the game, you'll see yourself entering Main Street of the Wild West town alongside your three gunslingers companions. You might stop at the Deadwood saloon for a hearty meal that will give you energy before going hunting with the outlaws. A metal frame holds the bigger reel set that's now three and four rows tall. Each of the three bounty hunters commands their own reel, providing increasing multipliers as they move in full view.\n \nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n \nThe Deadwood slot has plenty of bonus features. You have the Hunter xNudge Wild feature, which sees the wild bounty hunter push to become fully visible and increase the multiplier on each spin. Sheriff badges also trigger the Shoot Out feature, where low-value symbols turn into wilds. Then there are 3 Free Spins features. One of them sees the Hunter xNudge Wild feature trigger on every free spin. The Gunslinger Spins feature sees the multiplier increase infinitely. The best one is the Shoot Out Free Spins feature, where Sheriff badges are locked in place so that the Shoot Out feature applies on every Free Spin.\n\nThere are three bounty hunters in the Deadwood Slot. They allow you to win up to 4 Free Spins and appear on reels 2, 3, and 4. When they appear, you must hope they keep coming on every spin. With each appearance of a bounty hunter, the Wild multiplier increases by 1x. If multiple Wild multipliers appear, they are added together for a total Wild multiplier. Wilds substitute for all symbols except the Scatter and Sheriff badge symbols.\n \nBeware of the Sheriff badge symbol. When the Sheriff badge symbol appears on both reels 1 and 5 in the base game, the Shoot Out feature is triggered. All low-value symbols on the 3 middle reels will turn into Wild symbols.\n\nThe most important symbol is the Scatter. 3 of them appearing simultaneously give you the chance to choose between 2 and 8 Free Spins.\n \nHunter Spins feature: with 8 spins awarded to the hunter, at least 1 Hunter Wild is guaranteed to land on every Free Spin. This triggers the Hunter xNudge Wild feature with multipliers. Sheriff badges can also land with the addition of 1 extra spin to what you already have.\n \nGunslinger Spins feature: with 8 gun spins awarded, this is a more volatile option. You challenge the gunslingers head-on and try to win the unlimited win multiplier that remains for the entire feature. Any landing with a Hunter Wild symbol triggers the unlimited win multiplier. Every landing with the Sheriff badge gives you 1 extra Free Spin every time.\n \nSimilar Slot Machines\n \nBooming Games has developed a serious Wild West themed slot that brings the best of this genre's features and does a few more things to improve your chances of a big win.\n \nGunspinner has a layout of three rows and five reels. So far, nothing different from the standard. Symbols spin on 20 always-active paylines and are divided into high-value and low-value symbols. There is a Wild symbol that can replace any other symbol except bonus symbols. In addition to this, the Wild can also bring multipliers to your winnings.\n            ",
