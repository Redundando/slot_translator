Quickspin has successfully adapted one of the most famous fairy tales of our childhood, \"The Three Little Pigs\", and turned it into a thrilling gaming experience. The graphics and soundtrack will immediately strike a chord with any experienced gambler seeking an immersive adventure. \n\nThe idyllic countryside, complete with a straw cottage and rolling hills, provides the backdrop for the reels. Big Bad Wolf is a standard 5x3 slot with 25 paylines that can be activated or deactivated through the game settings located at the bottom of the screen. Keep a close eye on the display on the left-hand side of the screen to track your total credit balance. \n\nLet's dive into the symbols of Big Bad Wolf. The low-paying icons range from 10 to Ace, and while they may not offer substantial payouts, landing five of them on the same payline will reward you with 75-100 times your bet. The pig symbol offers a payout of 200 times your stake, while the Three Little Pigs - The Builder and The Painter - offer 250 times your bet. The laziest pig offers the highest payout of up to 300 times your stake. \n\nThe Wild symbol is represented by a beehive and can substitute for all other symbols except for the Scatter, which is none other than the Big Bad Wolf himself. Landing three of the wolf Scatters will trigger 10 Free Spins, but landing three Full Moon Scatters during the Bonus will cause the wolf to blow down not only the wooden house but also the brick house for massive wins. \n\nBig Bad Wolf boasts several exciting features, including the Wild feature, which sees Pig symbols turn into Wilds from the second consecutive win, and the Scatter feature, which awards Free Spins when three or more wolf Scatters appear on the screen. The Bonus feature involves accumulating at least three Full Moon Scatters to trigger the wolf's huffing and puffing for even more winning combinations. \n\nQuickspin has successfully translated a timeless fairy tale into an exciting slot game in Big Bad Wolf.
