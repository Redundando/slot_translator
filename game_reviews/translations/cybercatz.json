With its futuristic grid, hexagonal positions, and holograms, the game offers crisp and sharp graphics that create an immersive experience for players.\n\nThe central role in the game is attributed to the Wild symbol, which replaces all other icons to maximize winning combinations. Meanwhile, the game's soundtrack adds an extra touch of richness to the theme.\n\nThe game's main attraction is the free spins feature, triggered by finding 3 to 5 symbols bearing the name of the function. This can lead to up to 30 additional spins to be accumulated. Additionally, players can activate the special game called \"Cyber City Bonus\" by finding 3 or 4 bonus symbols.\n\nIn this game, players select a character and roll the dice to move on the board displayed on your screen. The game helps them collect extra money and ends when they've used up all three lives.\n\nWhile the RTP is slightly below average at 95.1%, CyberCatz offers an original and unexpected theme with interesting features that experienced players will enjoy.\n        ",

The game features hexagonal positions, planets to discover, and holograms to navigate. The graphics and soundtrack create a unique and immersive experience, with a focus on extravagant cat warriors.\n\nWild Symbol Importance\n\nThe Wild symbol in CyberCatz is central to gameplay and has the power to replace all other icons to maximize winning combinations. However, it cannot replace bonus icons or Free Spin symbols. This feature allows players to make strategic moves to increase their chances of winning.\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nOne of the main attractions of CyberCatz is the free spins feature. Players can trigger up to 30 free spins by finding 3 to 5 symbols bearing the name of the function. The number of additional spins ranges from 10 with 3 Scatters, 20 spins with 4 Scatters, and 30 spins with 5 symbols. This feature gives players the opportunity to accumulate additional spins and increase their chances of winning big.\n\nCyber City Bonus Game\n\nIf a player finds 3 or 4 bonus symbols in CyberCatz, they can activate the special game called \"Cyber City Bonus\". The game involves selecting a character and rolling the dice to move on the board displayed on the screen. The game helps players collect extra money and ends when they use up all three lives at their disposal. This feature offers players a chance to win additional prizes and make the game more exciting.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP)\n\nCyberCatz has an RTP of 95.1%, which is slightly below average. While this may not be ideal for experienced players, it's perfect for entertainment and winning. Players can still enjoy the game and have the opportunity to win big with the game's various features.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame design and graphics\n\nCyberCatz is set in a futuristic world with intergalactic adventures and offers an immersive experience for gamblers. The game features a hexagonal reel layout, planets, and holograms to navigate. The visuals are crisp, sharp and accompanied by engaging sound effects that add a layer of realism to the game. The graphics are well-designed and developed and take the player on a unique journey that is both unexpected and original.\n\nWild Symbol Mechanics\n\nThe game's Wild symbol plays a central role in maximizing winning combinations by replacing all other icons. However, it cannot replace Bonus and Free Spins symbols. The Wild symbol feature is well-implemented and helps the player earn more while keeping the game exciting and unpredictable.\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nThe Free Spins feature is CyberCatz's most attractive feature. Players can trigger up to 30 free spins, depending on the number of scatter symbols they land (10, 20, and 30 for 3, 4, and 5 scatters, respectively). Free Spins are a great way to earn more cash or simply play for fun without risking any of your own money.\n\nSpecial Game: Cyber City Bonus\n\nIf a player achieves three or four Bonus symbols, they can activate the Cyber City Bonus game. In this game, the player must choose a character and roll the dice to move along a board. The game helps players collect extra cash while enjoying the CyberCatz game to the fullest. Players have up to three lives, and the game ends when they run out.\n\nReturn to Player percentages\n\nCyberCatz has an RTP of 95.1%, which is slightly below average. Nonetheless, the game maintains an exciting pace and offers various features to make up for this slight shortcoming. The intriguing theme, well-designed graphics, and innovative features of the game make it appealing to many experienced players who are looking for an original and adventurous slot game.\n\n        \n            ",
