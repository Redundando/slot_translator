The Snake Wilds are a random feature in the base game where a certain number of wilds are added to random positions on the reels to provide more potential for scoring a win.\n\nBook of Souls is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 10 fixed paylines. The betting size starts at 0.10 credits for low rollers, while high rollers can go up to 100 credits. High volatility doesn't mean low RTP as shown by the study conducted on this Slot Machine, which has defined the Slot's RTP at 96.90%. To keep up with the times, Spearhead has optimized the Slot for mobile, but it looks and plays equally well on a desktop PC.\n\nAn Indiana Jones-style graphics theme\n\nAs expected, the slot has an adventure theme, with the hero being Lara Jones who enters an ancient Mayan temple. The archaeologist turned treasure hunter is searching for the mystical Book of Souls, which can unlock the legendary hidden riches within the massive stone structure. Of course, there is a villain on the reels trying to prevent Lara from taking home the riches. The game's setting is located in front of the entrance to the hidden temple with the pay symbols resting on stones that must be removed to enter. The stones shake with each new cascade of pay symbols, so we can already see the presence of Tumbling Reels, while a suspenseful soundtrack increases the expectations of finding vast treasures.\n\nThe objective of the Slot is to find a sacred Book of Souls - a key to the mysteries and riches of the Maya. Alongside Lara, a member of a secret organization is also searching for this source of power, so there is some friction and tension between the protagonist and the antagonist. There are also sacred Mayan masks and totems, as well as stylized card icons.\n\nSlot Machine features and symbols\n\nAll the pay symbols are held up on giant stones that roll onto the game window instead of the usual rotation of the reel set. The lowest value symbols are the Maya-style card symbols that range from 10 to Ace, while the premium symbols are two Maya artifacts, the villain wielding a gun, and Lara Jones herself. The Slot Machine pays out for a single five of a range from 10x to 500x the bet. The ancient Book of Souls, with intricate design, is the Scatter and Wild symbol on the reels.\n\nHit at least three scatters anywhere on the reels to trigger 10 free spins, which can be triggered again indefinitely. Additionally, a win of 2x, 20, and 200x is awarded for three, four, and five scatters. Before the bonus round starts, one of the nine regular paying symbols is selected as the special symbol. When there is enough room on a free spin, they will expand vertically to cover the entire reel and consequently, you will win for sure due to the increased probability of combinations. You will need at least three low-paying symbols or at least two premium symbols anywhere on the screen to see them expand and award a win.\n\nThis is, of course, the moment when the slot can produce the maximum payout with a single spin. The special symbol selected must be Lara Jones and if there are five empty spaces on the Slot, the symbols will expand to pay 10 times the single line win for a five, which is 500x the bet, for a total of 5,000x the bet.\n\nAs soon as three or more Scatter symbols hit the grid, be ready to enter a secret path in the temple, which leads to ten or more free spins, as a session can be recovered.\n\nBefore beginning the bonus spins, one icon is chosen at random as the Expansion, and will occasionally cover the entire reel. Additionally, Lara can also stumble upon green snakes that will show her a way to make Snake Spins, where from three to ten random Wilds are included in each spin.\n\nThe grid has five reels, three rows, and ten fixed paylines. One spin can cost from 0.10 cents to 100 credits. This allows both low rollers and high rollers to follow their preferred betting strategies. Automatic spins and turbo spins are included.\n\nThe book is both the Scatter and the Wild. It pays up to 200x the line bet for its combination of five of a kind and unlocks a feature.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nDiscover the Book of Ra Deluxe slot and play for a chance to win up to 20,000x on two reel-sets simultaneously.\n\nWhat makes it unique is the reel-set of four rows and five reels, which is the first, the second is five reels and twelve rows. With this reel-set arrangement, players get a slightly different slot experience, where they can see wins on both sides of the screen."

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nOverview\nGameplay Features\nGraphics\nBetting Size\nRTP and Volatility\nBonus Features\nMobile Optimization\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Book of Souls\n\nSpearhead Studios, formerly known as GiG Games, the self-proclaimed \"game changers\", have taken a step forward and added a twist to the classic Book of base game, primarily produced by Novomatic with its Book of Ra. The Snake Wilds are a random feature in the base game where a certain number of wilds are added to random positions on the reels to provide more potential for scoring a win.\n\nBook of Souls is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 10 fixed paylines. The betting size starts at 0.10 credits for low rollers, while high rollers can go up to 100 credits. High volatility doesn't mean low RTP as shown by the study conducted on this Slot Machine, which has defined the Slot's RTP at 96.90%. To keep up with the times, Spearhead has optimized the Slot for mobile, but it looks and plays equally well on a desktop PC.\n\nAn Indiana Jones-style graphics theme\n\nAs expected, the slot has an adventure theme, with the hero being Lara Jones who enters an ancient Mayan temple. The archaeologist turned treasure hunter is searching for the mystical Book of Souls, which can unlock the legendary hidden riches within the massive stone structure. Of course, there is a villain on the reels trying to prevent Lara from taking home the riches. The game's setting is located in front of the entrance to the hidden temple with the pay symbols resting on stones that must be removed to enter. The stones shake with each new cascade of pay symbols, so we can already see the presence of Tumbling Reels, while a suspenseful soundtrack increases the expectations of finding vast treasures.\n\nThe objective of the Slot is to find a sacred Book of Souls - a key to the mysteries and riches of the Maya. Alongside Lara, a member of a secret organization is also searching for this source of power, so there is some friction and tension between the protagonist and the antagonist. There are also sacred Mayan masks and totems, as well as stylized card icons.\n\nSlot Machine features and symbols\n\nAll the pay symbols are held up on giant stones that roll onto the game window instead of the usual rotation of the reel set. The lowest value symbols are the Maya-style card symbols that range from 10 to Ace, while the premium symbols are two Maya artifacts, the villain wielding a gun, and Lara Jones herself. The Slot Machine pays out for a single five of a range from 10x to 500x the bet. The ancient Book of Souls, with intricate design, is the Scatter and Wild symbol on the reels.\n\nHit at least three scatters anywhere on the reels to trigger 10 free spins, which can be triggered again indefinitely. Additionally, a win of 2x, 20, and 200x is awarded for three, four, and five scatters. Before the bonus round starts, one of the nine regular paying symbols is selected as the special symbol. When there is enough room on a free spin, they will expand vertically to cover the entire reel and consequently, you will win for sure due to the increased probability of combinations. You will need at least three low-paying symbols or at least two premium symbols anywhere on the screen to see them expand and award a win.\n\nThis is, of course, the moment when the slot can produce the maximum payout with a single spin. The special symbol selected must be Lara Jones and if there are five empty spaces on the Slot, the symbols will expand to pay 10 times the single line win for a five, which is 500x the bet, for a total of 5,000x the bet.\n\nAs soon as three or more Scatter symbols hit the grid, be ready to enter a secret path in the temple, which leads to ten or more free spins, as a session can be recovered.\n\nBefore beginning the bonus spins, one icon is chosen at random as the Expansion, and will occasionally cover the entire reel. Additionally, Lara can also stumble upon green snakes that will show her a way to make Snake Spins, where from three to ten random Wilds are included in each spin.\n\nThe grid has five reels, three rows, and ten fixed paylines. One spin can cost from 0.10 cents to 100 credits. This allows both low rollers and high rollers to follow their preferred betting strategies. Automatic spins and turbo spins are included.\n\nThe book is both the Scatter and the Wild. It pays up to 200x the line bet for its combination of five of a kind and unlocks a feature.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nDiscover the Book of Ra Deluxe slot and play for a chance to win up to 20,000x on two reel-sets simultaneously.\n\nWhat makes it unique is the reel-set of four rows and five reels, which is the first, the second is five reels and twelve rows. With this reel-set arrangement, players get a slightly different slot experience, where they can see wins on both sides of the screen.\n            ",

So, with an RTP of 96.9%, you can expect to win back almost all of your investment over time, which is excellent news for those of us who like to play for extended periods.</p> <p>But, let's get back to the volatility factor.

So, with an RTP of 96.9%, you can expect to win back almost all of your investment over time, which is excellent news for those of us who like to play for extended periods.</p> <p>But, let's get back to the volatility factor. Don't be intimidated by it; instead, embrace the risks and enjoy the thrill of hitting a big win! After all, Rome wasn't built in a day, but a few spins on Book of Souls might just be enough to get you a step closer to your own treasure.

The game has a high volatility level, but the RTP is 96.90%, one of the highest in the industry. The minimum and maximum betting levels are 0.10 credits and 100 credits, respectively. The slot features Indiana Jones-style graphics that are optimized for desktop and mobile devices.\n\nGameplay Features\n\nBook of Souls has several unique features, including Snake Wilds, Tumbling Reels, and Free Spins. The pay symbols are held up on giant stones that roll onto the game window instead of the traditional reel set. The Scatter and Wild symbols are the ancient Book of Souls. To trigger the Free Spins, the player must obtain at least three Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. Additionally, one of the nine regular paying symbols is selected as the special symbol before the bonus round starts. When there is enough room on a free spin, the special symbols will expand vertically to cover the entire reel and consequently, increase the probability of winning combinations.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics in Book of Souls are designed to provide an immersive experience that takes players on an adventure through an ancient Mayan temple. The archaeologist turned treasure hunter, Lara Jones, is the hero of the game, and she is searching for the mystical Book of Souls that can unlock hidden riches in the temple. The theme of the game is Indiana Jones-style adventure, with the player hoping to find the sacred book. The slot features well-designed symbols, animations, and sound effects that create a suspenseful atmosphere.\n\nBetting Size\n\nBook of Souls is suitable for both low rollers and high rollers. The minimum bet amount is 0.10 credits, while the maximum bet amount is 100 credits. This allows players to choose their preferred betting strategy. Automatic spins and turbo spins are included for convenience.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nBook of Souls has a high volatility level, which means that the game's payouts are infrequent, but they tend to be larger when they occur. However, the RTP of the game is 96.90%, which is one of the best in the industry. This means that the game returns 96.90% of the total money wagered on it to players over its lifetime.\n\nBonus Features\n\nBook of Souls has several exciting bonus features, including Free Spins, Snake Wilds, and Tumbling Reels. To trigger the Free Spins, the player must obtain at least three Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. Additionally, one of the nine regular paying symbols is selected as the special symbol before the bonus round starts. When there is enough room on a free spin, the special symbols will expand vertically to cover the entire reel, which increases the probability of winning combinations. The Snake Wilds is a random feature in the base game, where certain wilds are added to random positions on the reels to provide more potential for win.\n\nMobile Optimization\n\nSpearhead Studios has optimized Book of Souls for mobile devices, allowing players to enjoy the game on their smartphones and tablets. The game's Indiana Jones-style graphics maintain their quality on the smaller screen, and the gameplay remains smooth and responsive. Players can place bets, trigger bonus features, and claim their winnings on their mobile devices with ease.\n\n        \n            ",

Players join Lara Jones, an archaeologist turned treasure hunter, on her quest to uncover the Book of Souls and the legendarily rich trasures hidden within an ancient Maya temple. The reels are set in front of the entrance to the temple, with the pay symbols resting on stones that shake with each new cascade of pay symbols. The game also features a villain who aims to prevent Lara from taking home the riches, leading to some tension and friction.\n\nGameplay features\n\nBook of Souls features a number of gameplay features designed to help players win big. The Snake Wilds, for example, are a random feature in the base game where a certain number of wilds are added to random positions on the reels to provide more potential for scoring a win. The slot also includes Tumbling Reels, where pay symbols roll onto the game window rather than rotating in the reel set. The Book of Souls itself serves as both the Scatter and the Wild symbol, paying up to 200x the line bet for its combination of five of a kind and unlocking a feature.\n\nReels, rows, and paylines\n\nBook of Souls is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 10 fixed paylines.\n\nBetting size and limits\n\nPlayers can bet between 0.10 credits for low rollers up to 100 credits for high rollers, catering to a wide range of betting strategies.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nDespite its high volatility, Book of Souls has an RTP of 96.90%, ensuring players have a good chance to get some of their invested money back.\n\nBonus features\n\nHit at least three Book of Souls Scatter symbols to trigger 10 free spins, which can be triggered again infinitely. Before the bonus round starts, one of the nine regular paying symbols is selected as the special symbol. When there is enough room on a free spin, the special symbol expands vertically to cover the entire reel, increasing the probability of combinations and awarding a guaranteed win. The session can be re-triggered by hitting three or more Scatter symbols on the grid. Additionally, Lara can stumble upon green snakes that will show her a way to make Snake Spins, where from three to ten random Wilds are included in each spin.\n\nMobile and desktop optimization\n\nSpearhead Studios has optimized Book of Souls for mobile to cater to players who prefer playing on the go. The game runs smoothly and looks great on both mobile and desktop devices, providing a seamless gaming experience across all platforms.\n\n        \n            ",

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a review of the game \"Book of Souls\".\n\nPlease provide an FAQ:\n\n- 8 questions\n- Use simple language and provide practical takeaways.\n- Respond with a JSON!\n- Use the key \"faq\" and an array with the keys \"question\" and \"answer\". \n\nReview: Book of Souls\n\nSpearhead Studios, formerly known as GiG Games, the self-proclaimed \"game changers\", have taken a step forward and added a twist to the classic Book of base game, primarily produced by Novomatic with its Book of Ra. The Snake Wilds are a random feature in the base game where a certain number of wilds are added to random positions on the reels to provide more potential for scoring a win.\n\nBook of Souls is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 10 fixed paylines. The betting size starts at 0.10 credits for low rollers, while high rollers can go up to 100 credits. High volatility doesn't mean low RTP as shown by the study conducted on this Slot Machine, which has defined the Slot's RTP at 96.90%. To keep up with the times, Spearhead has optimized the Slot for mobile, but it looks and plays equally well on a desktop PC.\n\nAn Indiana Jones-style graphics theme\n\nAs expected, the slot has an adventure theme, with the hero being Lara Jones who enters an ancient Mayan temple. The archaeologist turned treasure hunter is searching for the mystical Book of Souls, which can unlock the legendary hidden riches within the massive stone structure. Of course, there is a villain on the reels trying to prevent Lara from taking home the riches. The game's setting is located in front of the entrance to the hidden temple with the pay symbols resting on stones that must be removed to enter. The stones shake with each new cascade of pay symbols, so we can already see the presence of Tumbling Reels, while a suspenseful soundtrack increases the expectations of finding vast treasures.\n\nThe objective of the Slot is to find a sacred Book of Souls - a key to the mysteries and riches of the Maya. Alongside Lara, a member of a secret organization is also searching for this source of power, so there is some friction and tension between the protagonist and the antagonist. There are also sacred Mayan masks and totems, as well as stylized card icons.\n\nSlot Machine features and symbols\n\nAll the pay symbols are held up on giant stones that roll onto the game window instead of the usual rotation of the reel set. The lowest value symbols are the Maya-style card symbols that range from 10 to Ace, while the premium symbols are two Maya artifacts, the villain wielding a gun, and Lara Jones herself. The Slot Machine pays out for a single five of a range from 10x to 500x the bet. The ancient Book of Souls, with intricate design, is the Scatter and Wild symbol on the reels.\n\nHit at least three scatters anywhere on the reels to trigger 10 free spins, which can be triggered again indefinitely. Additionally, a win of 2x, 20, and 200x is awarded for three, four, and five scatters. Before the bonus round starts, one of the nine regular paying symbols is selected as the special symbol. When there is enough room on a free spin, they will expand vertically to cover the entire reel and consequently, you will win for sure due to the increased probability of combinations. You will need at least three low-paying symbols or at least two premium symbols anywhere on the screen to see them expand and award a win.\n\nThis is, of course, the moment when the slot can produce the maximum payout with a single spin. The special symbol selected must be Lara Jones and if there are five empty spaces on the Slot, the symbols will expand to pay 10 times the single line win for a five, which is 500x the bet, for a total of 5,000x the bet.\n\nAs soon as three or more Scatter symbols hit the grid, be ready to enter a secret path in the temple, which leads to ten or more free spins, as a session can be recovered.\n\nBefore beginning the bonus spins, one icon is chosen at random as the Expansion, and will occasionally cover the entire reel. Additionally, Lara can also stumble upon green snakes that will show her a way to make Snake Spins, where from three to ten random Wilds are included in each spin.\n\nThe grid has five reels, three rows, and ten fixed paylines. One spin can cost from 0.10 cents to 100 credits. This allows both low rollers and high rollers to follow their preferred betting strategies. Automatic spins and turbo spins are included.\n\nThe book is both the Scatter and the Wild. It pays up to 200x the line bet for its combination of five of a kind and unlocks a feature.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nDiscover the Book of Ra Deluxe slot and play for a chance to win up to 20,000x on two reel-sets simultaneously.\n\nWhat makes it unique is the reel-set of four rows and five reels, which is the first, the second is five reels and twelve rows. With this reel-set arrangement, players get a slightly different slot experience, where they can see wins on both sides of the screen.\n            ",

Additionally, a win of 2x, 20, and 200x is awarded for three, four, and five scatters. Before the bonus round starts, one of the nine regular paying symbols is selected as the special symbol. When there is enough room on a free spin, they will expand vertically to cover the entire reel and consequently, you will win for sure due to the increased probability of combinations. You will need at least three low-paying symbols or at least two premium symbols anywhere on the screen to see them expand and award a win.\n\nThis is, of course, the moment when the slot can produce the maximum payout with a single spin. The special symbol selected must be Lara Jones and if there are five empty spaces on the Slot, the symbols will expand to pay 10 times the single line win for a five, which is 500x the bet, for a total of 5,000x the bet.\n\nAs soon as three or more Scatter symbols hit the grid, be ready to enter a secret path in the temple, which leads to ten or more free spins, as a session can be recovered.\n\nBefore beginning the bonus spins, one icon is chosen at random as the Expansion, and will occasionally cover the entire reel. Additionally, Lara can also stumble upon green snakes that will show her a way to make Snake Spins, where from three to ten random Wilds are included in each spin.\n\nThe grid has five reels, three rows, and ten fixed paylines. One spin can cost from 0.10 cents to 100 credits. This allows both low rollers and high rollers to follow their preferred betting strategies. Automatic spins and turbo spins are included.\n\nThe book is both the Scatter and the Wild. It pays up to 200x the line bet for its combination of five of a kind and unlocks a feature.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nDiscover the Book of Ra Deluxe slot and play for a chance to win up to 20,000x on two reel-sets simultaneously.\n\nWhat makes it unique is the reel-set of four rows and five reels, which is the first, the second is five reels and twelve rows. With this reel-set arrangement, players get a slightly different slot experience, where they can see wins on both sides of the screen.\n        ",
