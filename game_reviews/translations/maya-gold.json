It features a Mini Slot Bonus and Memory Bonus where you can win cash prizes. But the main attraction is the Free Spins Bonus, where you can win up to 1,000 free spins with a 2x multiplier.\n\nImmerse yourself in the rainforest as you search for ancient treasures in this Maya-themed slot game. With a Maya temple looming in the background, Maya Gold has a truly immersive, real-world slot experience. The symbols include Chichen Itza, toucans, swords, Maya leaders, Maya goddesses, Maya masks, gold coins and Maya statues.\n\nThe most rewarding symbol is the Maya statue, with 2, 3, 4 or 5 in combination giving you 0.4, 6, 40 or 200 times your stake, respectively. The jaguar is the wild symbol and appears only on reels 1, 2 and 3 – it substitutes for all symbols except for free spins, the Mini Slot Bonus and bonus symbols. Winning formations are formed from left to right starting from reel 1.\n\nEvery time the bonus symbol (the gray Maya face) appears on reel 5, you will get 25 points for each payline multiplied by the bet line. For example, if you play at £1 per spin, you will get 100 points every time the bonus symbol appears. Once you have accumulated 1,000 points, you will activate the Memory Bonus feature.\n\nYou will then have 4 spins to find a matching pair of prizes that appear on stone slabs. If a matching pair is revealed on any of the 2 stone slabs, you win the prize on display. These prizes can range from 1 to 25 times your total bet. If you uncover a slab with a 2x multiplier, your win is doubled (up to 50 times the prize bet).\n\nThe main attraction of Maya Gold is the Free Spins Bonus feature – it is triggered when you get 3 or more scattered free spin symbols anywhere on the reels. 3, 4 or 5 of them will give you 8, 20 or 100 free spins, respectively – all wins are also subject to a 2x multiplier.\n\nAdditionally, during the feature, free spin scatters will appear, meaning you can re-trigger the Free Spins Bonus – 3, 4 or 5 will reward you with an extra 8, 20 or 100 free spins. In fact, you can re-trigger multiple times with a maximum of 1,000 free spins available in total. Lastly, you can activate the Mini Slot Bonus and Memory Bonus features within the Free Spins Bonus feature.\n\nMaya Gold comes with a Mini Slot Bonus feature – this is played when you get 3 or more Mini Slot Bonus symbols appearing from left to right starting from reel 1. The more symbols that appear, the more bonus slot spins you will be awarded – 3, 4 or 5 Mini Slot Bonus symbols will give you 1, 2 or 3 bonus slot spins, respectively. The Mini Slot reel set spins and gives you a winning combination for each bonus spin:\n\n- 3 Cherries will reward you with a prize ranging from 0.8 to 2 times your stake.\n- 3 Oranges will reward you with a prize ranging from 2.4 to 5 times your stake.\n- 3 Bars will reward you with a prize ranging from 6 to 40 times your stake.\n\nIf you chose this slot game, chances are you are a true enthusiast of Maya civilization, with all its vibrant colors and hidden treasures and secrets. If so, we recommend trying your luck with Mayan Temple Revenge, the slot game produced by Capecod that will let you make easy money.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nMaya Gold slot game features\nSymbols and winning formations in Maya Gold\nBonus features in Maya Gold\nHow to trigger the free spins bonus in Maya Gold\nBenefits of playing Maya Gold\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Maya Gold is a 5-reel, 25-payline slot game from IGT with a Maya theme that can be played from 25p to £10 per spin on all devices, including smartphones and tablets. It features a Mini Slot Bonus and Memory Bonus where you can win cash prizes. But the main attraction is the Free Spins Bonus, where you can win up to 1,000 free spins with a 2x multiplier.\n\nImmerse yourself in the rainforest as you search for ancient treasures in this Maya-themed slot game. With a Maya temple looming in the background, Maya Gold has a truly immersive, real-world slot experience. The symbols include Chichen Itza, toucans, swords, Maya leaders, Maya goddesses, Maya masks, gold coins and Maya statues.\n\nThe most rewarding symbol is the Maya statue, with 2, 3, 4 or 5 in combination giving you 0.4, 6, 40 or 200 times your stake, respectively. The jaguar is the wild symbol and appears only on reels 1, 2 and 3 – it substitutes for all symbols except for free spins, the Mini Slot Bonus and bonus symbols. Winning formations are formed from left to right starting from reel 1.\n\nEvery time the bonus symbol (the gray Maya face) appears on reel 5, you will get 25 points for each payline multiplied by the bet line. For example, if you play at £1 per spin, you will get 100 points every time the bonus symbol appears. Once you have accumulated 1,000 points, you will activate the Memory Bonus feature.\n\nYou will then have 4 spins to find a matching pair of prizes that appear on stone slabs. If a matching pair is revealed on any of the 2 stone slabs, you win the prize on display. These prizes can range from 1 to 25 times your total bet. If you uncover a slab with a 2x multiplier, your win is doubled (up to 50 times the prize bet).\n\nThe main attraction of Maya Gold is the Free Spins Bonus feature – it is triggered when you get 3 or more scattered free spin symbols anywhere on the reels. 3, 4 or 5 of them will give you 8, 20 or 100 free spins, respectively – all wins are also subject to a 2x multiplier.\n\nAdditionally, during the feature, free spin scatters will appear, meaning you can re-trigger the Free Spins Bonus – 3, 4 or 5 will reward you with an extra 8, 20 or 100 free spins. In fact, you can re-trigger multiple times with a maximum of 1,000 free spins available in total. Lastly, you can activate the Mini Slot Bonus and Memory Bonus features within the Free Spins Bonus feature.\n\nMaya Gold comes with a Mini Slot Bonus feature – this is played when you get 3 or more Mini Slot Bonus symbols appearing from left to right starting from reel 1. The more symbols that appear, the more bonus slot spins you will be awarded – 3, 4 or 5 Mini Slot Bonus symbols will give you 1, 2 or 3 bonus slot spins, respectively. The Mini Slot reel set spins and gives you a winning combination for each bonus spin:\n\n- 3 Cherries will reward you with a prize ranging from 0.8 to 2 times your stake.\n- 3 Oranges will reward you with a prize ranging from 2.4 to 5 times your stake.\n- 3 Bars will reward you with a prize ranging from 6 to 40 times your stake.\n\nIf you chose this slot game, chances are you are a true enthusiast of Maya civilization, with all its vibrant colors and hidden treasures and secrets. If so, we recommend trying your luck with Mayan Temple Revenge, the slot game produced by Capecod that will let you make easy money.\n            ",

For example, if you play at £1 per spin, you will get 100 points every time the bonus symbol appears. Once you have accumulated 1,000 points, you will activate the Memory Bonus feature.\n\nYou will then have 4 spins to find a matching pair of prizes that appear on stone slabs. If a matching pair is revealed on any of the 2 stone slabs, you win the prize on display. These prizes can range from 1 to 25 times your total bet. If you uncover a slab with a 2x multiplier, your win is doubled (up to 50 times the prize bet).\n\nThe main attraction of Maya Gold is the Free Spins Bonus feature – it is triggered when you get 3 or more scattered free spin symbols anywhere on the reels. 3, 4 or 5 of them will give you 8, 20 or 100 free spins, respectively – all wins are also subject to a 2x multiplier.\n\nAdditionally, during the feature, free spin scatters will appear, meaning you can re-trigger the Free Spins Bonus – 3, 4 or 5 will reward you with an extra 8, 20 or 100 free spins. In fact, you can re-trigger multiple times with a maximum of 1,000 free spins available in total. Lastly, you can activate the Mini Slot Bonus and Memory Bonus features within the Free Spins Bonus feature.\n\nMaya Gold comes with a Mini Slot Bonus feature – this is played when you get 3 or more Mini Slot Bonus symbols appearing from left to right starting from reel 1. The more symbols that appear, the more bonus slot spins you will be awarded – 3, 4 or 5 Mini Slot Bonus symbols will give you 1, 2 or 3 bonus slot spins, respectively. The Mini Slot reel set spins and gives you a winning combination for each bonus spin:\n\n- 3 Cherries will reward you with a prize ranging from 0.8 to 2 times your stake.\n- 3 Oranges will reward you with a prize ranging from 2.4 to 5 times your stake.\n- 3 Bars will reward you with a prize ranging from 6 to 40 times your stake.\n\nIf you chose this slot game, chances are you are a true enthusiast of Maya civilization, with all its vibrant colors and hidden treasures and secrets. If so, we recommend trying your luck with Mayan Temple Revenge, the slot game produced by Capecod that will let you make easy money.\n            ",
