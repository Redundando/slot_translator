In the classic version, there were 9, while in the Deluxe variant there are 10 lines.\n\nBetting System\n\nBook of Ra Deluxe has a minimum bet per line of 1 and a maximum of 100.

As a Wild, it will replace any symbol in a winning line. As a Scatter, if three or more Book of Ra symbols appear on the reels during a spin, a scatter payment is won. As a Bonus, getting three or more Book of Ra symbols triggers the bonus round. The betting multiplier calculated is 18x for three books, 180x for four, and a maximum of 1800x for five.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe bonus round is what made Book of Ra Deluxe such an iconic slot.
