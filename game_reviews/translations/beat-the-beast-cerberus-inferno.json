One of the features that contribute to the game's potential for big wins is the stacked wilds, but there is also another wild that is associated with the bonus feature of free spins.\nThe Beat The Beast: Cerberus Inferno slot is produced by Thunderkick and is the third in the Beat the Beast series. With 5 reels and 9 paylines, you can spin on all devices starting at 10 cents per spin. With a Greek mythology theme, it comes with stacked wilds and a bonus game feature where you play free spins on a set of 243 ways to win the reel set. It has an RTP of 96.15% and a maximum win of 6,666x your bet for each free spin.\nA hellish graphic\nThe 3x5 reel-set is enclosed within a beaten steel frame and surrounded by curved scales that are a bridge leading the adventurer through the underlying lava river. The orange-purple glow of the fire is projected onto the entire background, giving the Beat the Beast Cerberus Inferno slot the menacing look it is intended to provide.\nA table of high and low payout symbols contains high cards ranging from ten to ace, while image symbols depict warrior helmets, weapons, and a few Cerberus artifacts: a gold statue, a medallion, and the three-headed beast itself, which appears as a scatter symbol.\nThe gameplay is characterized by few visual effects that highlight the heavy metal aspect of this reel adventure. An appropriate soundtrack is present to further enrich the gaming experience.\nThe Beat The Beast: Cerberus Inferno slot has a Greek mythology theme and is based on Cerberus, the hound of Hades. This multi-headed dog guards the gates of the underworld to prevent the dead from leaving. With an intense feel, you will see the steps leading to the gates of the underworld as flames light up the screen from below.\nYou will see real symbol A, K, Q, J, and 10 real symbols on the reels. There are also scepters, helmets, vases, a gold Cerberus statue, and a rather demonic flaming Cerberus. The latter pays 1.5, 10, 30, or 150 times your total stake for 2, 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\nThe most important symbol is the Cerberus Emblem symbol as it is both the wild and scatter symbol. By substituting any symbol to form winning combinations, it pays 150 x bet for 5 in combination. There is also a standard wild character W that replaces all symbols and appears stacked.\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThunderkick, the company that probably has the coolest name in the online slot producer world, also has a memorable layout when it comes to the controls and settings of their slots.\nThe three buttons in the lower right corner of the screen are directly involved in gameplay. The poker chip is where players can choose their bets, the smaller circle with the play button is for the autoplay option, and the largest of the three is the spin button that spins the reels once for the selected bet.\nThe Beat The Beast: Cerberus Inferno slot has a wide range of bets that start at 10 cents, so most players can approach the game on a low-stakes adventure. The maximum bet is 100.00 euros, preceded by multiple betting amounts. Once the bet is selected, you can press spin or play the autoplay option with the bet active.\nAutoplay allows you to relax and let the game spin without any manual input. There are additional options that allow you to set conditions that may stop the autoplay game when one of these is met, such as requesting that the autoplay feature stop as soon as a bonus feature is obtained. To start the game, just choose one of the preset automatic spins and press play.\nThe game displays the balance amount in the lower left corner of the screen, and the active bet amount is to the right of center. The menu button, which is a nine-point symbol, leads to the paytable of the game, the rules, and a few other information.\nOther similar slot machines\nIn the depths of the ocean dwells the Kraken, an ancient octopus-like creature that awaits to drag ships and sailors.

One of the features that can contribute to the great potential for winning are the stacked wilds, however, there is another wild that is linked to the bonus feature of free spins.\n\nThe Beat the Beast: Cerberus' Inferno slot is produced by Thunderkick and is the third in the Beat the Beast series. With 5 reels and 9 paylines, it can be spun on all devices starting from 10 cents per spin. With a Greek mythological theme, it comes with stacked wilds and a Bonus Game feature where you play for free spins on a set of 243 ways to win the set of reels. It has an RTP of 96.15% and a maximum payout of 6,666x your stake for each free spin.\n\nAn Infernal Graphic\nThe 3x5 reel-set is enclosed within a beaten steel frame and surrounded by curved stairs which are a bridge that takes the adventurer through the lava river below. The orange-purple glow of fire is projected on the entire background, giving Beat the Beast Cerberus' Inferno slot the threatening look it is intended to provide.\n\nA table of high and low paying symbols contains high cards ranging from ten to ace, while picture symbols depict warrior helmets, weapons, and a few Cerberus artifacts: golden statue, medallion, and the three-headed beast itself which appears as a Scatter symbol.\n\nThe gameplay is characterized by few visual effects that enhance the heavy metal aspect of this reel adventure. An appropriate soundtrack is present to further enrich the gaming experience.\n\nThe Beat the Beast: Cerberus' Inferno slot has a Greek mythological theme and is based on Cerberus, the watchdog of Hades. This multi-headed dog guards the gates of the underworld to prevent the dead from leaving. With an intense feeling, you will see the steps that lead to the gates of the Underworld while the flames illuminate the screen from below.\n\nYou will see the real symbols A, K, Q, J, and 10 real symbols on the reels. There are also scepters, helmets, vases, a golden statue of Cerberus, and a rather demonic flaming Cerberus. The latter pays out 1.5, 10, 30 or 150 times your total bet for 2, 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\n\nThe most important symbol is the Cerberus Emblem symbol as it is both the Wild and Scatter symbol. By substituting any symbol to form winning combinations, it pays 150 x bet for 5 in combination. There is also a standard W wild character that substitutes all symbols and appears stacked.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nThunderkick, the company that probably has the coolest name in the world of online slot producers, also has a memorable layout for their slot controls and settings.\n\nThe three buttons in the bottom right corner of the screen are directly involved in gameplay. The poker chip is where players can choose stakes, the smaller circle that has the play button is for the autoplay option, and the largest of the three is the spin button that spins the reels once the selected bet is placed.\n\nThe Beat the Beast: Cerberus' Inferno slot has a wide range of bets starting at 10 cents, so most players can take on the low-stake adventure. The maximum bet is 100.00 euros, preceded by multiple bet amounts. Once the bet is selected, you can press spin or play the autoplay option with the active bet.\n\nAutoplay allows you to relax and let the game spin without having to make any manual inputs. There are additional options that allow you to set conditions, which can stop the autoplay game when one of these conditions is met, such as requiring the autoplay feature to stop as soon as a bonus feature is obtained. To start the game, simply choose one of the preset automatic spins and press play.\n\nThe game shows the balance amount in the bottom left corner of the screen, and the active bet amount is to the right of the center. The menu button, which is a nine-point symbol, leads to the game's paytable, rules, and a few other information.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nIn the depths of the ocean, lives the Kraken, an ancient octopus-like creature waiting to drag ships and sailors down. Beat The Beast: Kraken's Lair is a 5-reel, 9-payline online slot by Thunderkick. The Kraken guards the ocean floor, and your task is to try to beat this legendary monster of Norse mythology. The slot looks promising, so try it out now if you're a fan of the genre."

One of the features that can contribute to the great potential for winning are the stacked wilds, however, there is another wild that is linked to the bonus feature of free spins.\n\nThe Beat the Beast: Cerberus' Inferno slot is produced by Thunderkick and is the third in the Beat the Beast series. With 5 reels and 9 paylines, it can be spun on all devices starting from 10 cents per spin. With a Greek mythological theme, it comes with stacked wilds and a Bonus Game feature where you play for free spins on a set of 243 ways to win the set of reels. It has an RTP of 96.15% and a maximum payout of 6,666x your stake for each free spin.\n\nAn Infernal Graphic\nThe 3x5 reel-set is enclosed within a beaten steel frame and surrounded by curved stairs which are a bridge that takes the adventurer through the lava river below. The orange-purple glow of fire is projected on the entire background, giving Beat the Beast Cerberus' Inferno slot the threatening look it is intended to provide.\n\nA table of high and low paying symbols contains high cards ranging from ten to ace, while picture symbols depict warrior helmets, weapons, and a few Cerberus artifacts: golden statue, medallion, and the three-headed beast itself which appears as a Scatter symbol.\n\nThe gameplay is characterized by few visual effects that enhance the heavy metal aspect of this reel adventure. An appropriate soundtrack is present to further enrich the gaming experience.\n\nThe Beat the Beast: Cerberus' Inferno slot has a Greek mythological theme and is based on Cerberus, the watchdog of Hades. This multi-headed dog guards the gates of the underworld to prevent the dead from leaving. With an intense feeling, you will see the steps that lead to the gates of the Underworld while the flames illuminate the screen from below.\n\nYou will see the real symbols A, K, Q, J, and 10 real symbols on the reels. There are also scepters, helmets, vases, a golden statue of Cerberus, and a rather demonic flaming Cerberus.

The maximum bet is 100.00 euros, preceded by multiple bet amounts.

There are additional options that allow you to set conditions, which can stop the autoplay game when one of these conditions is met, such as requiring the autoplay feature to stop as soon as a bonus feature is obtained. To start the game, simply choose one of the preset automatic spins and press play.\n\nThe game shows the balance amount in the bottom left corner of the screen, and the active bet amount is to the right of the center.

One of the features that can contribute to the great potential for winning are the stacked wilds, however, there is another wild that is linked to the bonus feature of free spins.\n\nThe Beat the Beast: Cerberus' Inferno slot is produced by Thunderkick and is the third in the Beat the Beast series. With 5 reels and 9 paylines, it can be spun on all devices starting from 10 cents per spin. With a Greek mythological theme, it comes with stacked wilds and a Bonus Game feature where you play for free spins on a set of 243 ways to win the set of reels. It has an RTP of 96.15% and a maximum payout of 6,666x your stake for each free spin.\n\nAn Infernal Graphic\nThe 3x5 reel-set is enclosed within a beaten steel frame and surrounded by curved stairs which are a bridge that takes the adventurer through the lava river below. The orange-purple glow of fire is projected on the entire background, giving Beat the Beast Cerberus' Inferno slot the threatening look it is intended to provide.\n\nA table of high and low paying symbols contains high cards ranging from ten to ace, while picture symbols depict warrior helmets, weapons, and a few Cerberus artifacts: golden statue, medallion, and the three-headed beast itself which appears as a Scatter symbol.\n\nThe gameplay is characterized by few visual effects that enhance the heavy metal aspect of this reel adventure. An appropriate soundtrack is present to further enrich the gaming experience.\n\nThe Beat the Beast: Cerberus' Inferno slot has a Greek mythological theme and is based on Cerberus, the watchdog of Hades. This multi-headed dog guards the gates of the underworld to prevent the dead from leaving. With an intense feeling, you will see the steps that lead to the gates of the Underworld while the flames illuminate the screen from below.\n\nYou will see the real symbols A, K, Q, J, and 10 real symbols on the reels. There are also scepters, helmets, vases, a golden statue of Cerberus, and a rather demonic flaming Cerberus. The latter pays out 1.5, 10, 30 or 150 times your total bet for 2, 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\n\nThe most important symbol is the Cerberus Emblem symbol as it is both the Wild and Scatter symbol. By substituting any symbol to form winning combinations, it pays 150 x bet for 5 in combination. There is also a standard W wild character that substitutes all symbols and appears stacked.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nThunderkick, the company that probably has the coolest name in the world of online slot producers, also has a memorable layout for their slot controls and settings.\n\nThe three buttons in the bottom right corner of the screen are directly involved in gameplay.

One of the features that can contribute to the great potential for winning are the stacked wilds, however, there is another wild that is linked to the bonus feature of free spins.\n\nThe Beat the Beast: Cerberus' Inferno slot is produced by Thunderkick and is the third in the Beat the Beast series. With 5 reels and 9 paylines, it can be spun on all devices starting from 10 cents per spin. With a Greek mythological theme, it comes with stacked wilds and a Bonus Game feature where you play for free spins on a set of 243 ways to win the set of reels. It has an RTP of 96.15% and a maximum payout of 6,666x your stake for each free spin.\n\nAn Infernal Graphic\nThe 3x5 reel-set is enclosed within a beaten steel frame and surrounded by curved stairs which are a bridge that takes the adventurer through the lava river below. The orange-purple glow of fire is projected on the entire background, giving Beat the Beast Cerberus' Inferno slot the threatening look it is intended to provide.\n\nA table of high and low paying symbols contains high cards ranging from ten to ace, while picture symbols depict warrior helmets, weapons, and a few Cerberus artifacts: golden statue, medallion, and the three-headed beast itself which appears as a Scatter symbol.\n\nThe gameplay is characterized by few visual effects that enhance the heavy metal aspect of this reel adventure. An appropriate soundtrack is present to further enrich the gaming experience.\n\nThe Beat the Beast: Cerberus' Inferno slot has a Greek mythological theme and is based on Cerberus, the watchdog of Hades. This multi-headed dog guards the gates of the underworld to prevent the dead from leaving. With an intense feeling, you will see the steps that lead to the gates of the Underworld while the flames illuminate the screen from below.\n\nYou will see the real symbols A, K, Q, J, and 10 real symbols on the reels. There are also scepters, helmets, vases, a golden statue of Cerberus, and a rather demonic flaming Cerberus. The latter pays out 1.5, 10, 30 or 150 times your total bet for 2, 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\n\nThe most important symbol is the Cerberus Emblem symbol as it is both the Wild and Scatter symbol. By substituting any symbol to form winning combinations, it pays 150 x bet for 5 in combination. There is also a standard W wild character that substitutes all symbols and appears stacked.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\nThunderkick, the company that probably has the coolest name in the world of online slot producers, also has a memorable layout for their slot controls and settings.\n\nThe three buttons in the bottom right corner of the screen are directly involved in gameplay. The poker chip is where players can choose stakes, the smaller circle that has the play button is for the autoplay option, and the largest of the three is the spin button that spins the reels once the selected bet is placed.\n\nThe Beat the Beast: Cerberus' Inferno slot has a wide range of bets starting at 10 cents, so most players can take on the low-stake adventure. The maximum bet is 100.00 euros, preceded by multiple bet amounts. Once the bet is selected, you can press spin or play the autoplay option with the active bet.\n\nAutoplay allows you to relax and let the game spin without having to make any manual inputs. There are additional options that allow you to set conditions, which can stop the autoplay game when one of these conditions is met, such as requiring the autoplay feature to stop as soon as a bonus feature is obtained. To start the game, simply choose one of the preset automatic spins and press play.\n\nThe game shows the balance amount in the bottom left corner of the screen, and the active bet amount is to the right of the center. The menu button, which is a nine-point symbol, leads to the game's paytable, rules, and a few other information.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nIn the depths of the ocean, lives the Kraken, an ancient octopus-like creature waiting to drag ships and sailors down. Beat The Beast: Kraken's Lair is a 5-reel, 9-payline online slot by Thunderkick. The Kraken guards the ocean floor, and your task is to try to beat this legendary monster of Norse mythology. The slot looks promising, so try it out now if you're a fan of the genre.\n            ",
