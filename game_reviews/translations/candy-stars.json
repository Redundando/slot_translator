            "response": "\"Candy Stars\" Review: A Slot Game with Sweet Rewards\n\nWith \"Candy Stars,\" Pragmatic Play brings us a slot game with simple gameplay but enormous potential. Before analyzing the game's features, let's take a look at the theme and graphics. As the title suggests, the game's theme is candy of different shapes and colors, including red, purple, and green spheres and triangular candies. Even the non-themed symbols, like playing cards, have round shapes reminiscent of delectable sweets.\n\nThe game grid has a blue background with lights and glows of varying shades of purple and blue. The buttons are all located at the bottom of the screen, leaving ample space for the game grid.\n\nRegarding the soundtrack, it is an electronic motif typically from the 80s. \n\nA Potentially Significant Win\n\nThe game grid consists of five reels and three rows, plus an additional horizontal reel at the top. Each spin costs €0.20, with a potential win of up to 5,000 times the bet. Players can also use the Autoplay function to set a certain number of automatic spins.\n\nTo win, match identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. The game's theoretical return to player is 96.47%, and the volatility is high.\n\nBonuses for Every Taste\n\nWhile Candy Stars has simple gameplay, it is far from lacking in bonuses. The system is cascading, meaning that after every paying combination, the winning symbols are removed, the remaining symbols drop down, and new symbols fill the empty positions. The base game symbols are eight, all paying out with a minimum combination of three and a maximum of five. The J to A cards, which are good for a royal flush, are the lower-paying symbols, while the candy symbols are much more lucrative. In order of increasing value, we have the blue, green, red, and finally, the purple ones.\n\nThe star symbol is the wild, replacing all symbols except the diamond, and can only appear on reels 2 to 4. If the wild appears on the horizontal reel, it is associated with an initial multiplier of x1. It remains fixed on the reel during the cascade, and with each winning combination, its multiplier increases by one.\n\nThe diamond is our scatter, and with three symbols, we get eight free spins. During the bonus game, each spin guarantees the presence of a wild on the horizontal reel. Unlike the base game, the multiplier starts at x2 and instead of increasing by +1 after every cascade, it is doubled. This function can also be purchased.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow many consecutive cascades can happen in a single spin?\n\nIn theory, infinite, but the multiplier stops at 128. If the cascading continues, that is the value applied to the winnings. \n\nIf I purchase the Bonus game, does the RTP value remain the same?\n\nNo, in this case, it drops slightly to 96.26%.\n\nAre there scatters and wilds?\n\nYes, both are present, and during the free spins, the wild that appears on the horizontal reel doubles the value of its multiplier. \n\nExperience the sweet rewards of \"Candy Stars\" for yourself and try your luck at this potentially lucrative slot game.",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay\nBonuses\nWinning Potential\nSymbols\nTheme and Graphics\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: \"Candy Stars\" Review: A Slot Game with Sweet Rewards\n\nWith \"Candy Stars,\" Pragmatic Play brings us a slot game with simple gameplay but enormous potential. Before analyzing the game's features, let's take a look at the theme and graphics. As the title suggests, the game's theme is candy of different shapes and colors, including red, purple, and green spheres and triangular candies. Even the non-themed symbols, like playing cards, have round shapes reminiscent of delectable sweets.\n\nThe game grid has a blue background with lights and glows of varying shades of purple and blue. The buttons are all located at the bottom of the screen, leaving ample space for the game grid.\n\nRegarding the soundtrack, it is an electronic motif typically from the 80s. \n\nA Potentially Significant Win\n\nThe game grid consists of five reels and three rows, plus an additional horizontal reel at the top. Each spin costs €0.20, with a potential win of up to 5,000 times the bet. Players can also use the Autoplay function to set a certain number of automatic spins.\n\nTo win, match identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. The game's theoretical return to player is 96.47%, and the volatility is high.\n\nBonuses for Every Taste\n\nWhile Candy Stars has simple gameplay, it is far from lacking in bonuses. The system is cascading, meaning that after every paying combination, the winning symbols are removed, the remaining symbols drop down, and new symbols fill the empty positions. The base game symbols are eight, all paying out with a minimum combination of three and a maximum of five. The J to A cards, which are good for a royal flush, are the lower-paying symbols, while the candy symbols are much more lucrative. In order of increasing value, we have the blue, green, red, and finally, the purple ones.\n\nThe star symbol is the wild, replacing all symbols except the diamond, and can only appear on reels 2 to 4. If the wild appears on the horizontal reel, it is associated with an initial multiplier of x1. It remains fixed on the reel during the cascade, and with each winning combination, its multiplier increases by one.\n\nThe diamond is our scatter, and with three symbols, we get eight free spins. During the bonus game, each spin guarantees the presence of a wild on the horizontal reel. Unlike the base game, the multiplier starts at x2 and instead of increasing by +1 after every cascade, it is doubled. This function can also be purchased.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow many consecutive cascades can happen in a single spin?\n\nIn theory, infinite, but the multiplier stops at 128. If the cascading continues, that is the value applied to the winnings. \n\nIf I purchase the Bonus game, does the RTP value remain the same?\n\nNo, in this case, it drops slightly to 96.26%.\n\nAre there scatters and wilds?\n\nYes, both are present, and during the free spins, the wild that appears on the horizontal reel doubles the value of its multiplier. \n\nExperience the sweet rewards of \"Candy Stars\" for yourself and try your luck at this potentially lucrative slot game.\n            ",

Players must match identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel. The game's theoretical return-to-player is 96.47%, and the volatility level is high. Each spin costs €0.20, and the highest potential win is up to 5,000 times the bet.

The base game features eight symbols with a minimum combination of three and maximum of five. The lower-paying symbols are J to A cards, and the candy symbols are more lucrative. The wild symbol is a star, and the scatter is a diamond. The wild symbol replaces all symbols except the diamond and appears only on reels 2 to 4, increasing its multiplier with each cascade. The diamond symbol triggers eight free spins, and during the bonus game, wilds appear on the horizontal reel with a multiplier that doubles after each cascade. This function can also be purchased.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nCandy Stars has a high volatility level and a potential win of up to 5,000 times the bet. The cascading system increases the chances of multiple wins per spin, and the wild symbol's multiplier increases with each cascade. During the bonus game, the wild multiplier doubles after each cascade.\n\nSymbols\n\nCandy Stars has a candy theme, featuring candy with different shapes and colors, including red, purple, and green spheres, and triangular candies. Even the non-themed symbols, like playing cards, have round shapes reminiscent of delectable sweets. The wild symbol is a star, and the scatter is a diamond.\n\nTheme and Graphics\n\nCandy Stars has a blue game grid background with lights and glows of varying shades of purple and blue. The buttons are located at the bottom of the screen, leaving ample space for the game grid. The soundtrack has an electronic motif typically from the 80s. The game's theme is candy-related, with various types and colors of candies for symbols.\n\n        \n            ",

Before analyzing the game's features, let's take a look at the theme and graphics. As the title suggests, the game's theme is candy of different shapes and colors, including red, purple, and green spheres and triangular candies. Even the non-themed symbols, like playing cards, have round shapes reminiscent of delectable sweets.\n\nThe game grid has a blue background with lights and glows of varying shades of purple and blue. The buttons are all located at the bottom of the screen, leaving ample space for the game grid.\n\nRegarding the soundtrack, it is an electronic motif typically from the 80s. \n\nA Potentially Significant Win\n\nThe game grid consists of five reels and three rows, plus an additional horizontal reel at the top. Each spin costs €0.20, with a potential win of up to 5,000 times the bet. Players can also use the Autoplay function to set a certain number of automatic spins.\n\nTo win, match identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. The game's theoretical return to player is 96.47%, and the volatility is high.\n\nBonuses for Every Taste\n\nWhile Candy Stars has simple gameplay, it is far from lacking in bonuses. The system is cascading, meaning that after every paying combination, the winning symbols are removed, the remaining symbols drop down, and new symbols fill the empty positions. The base game symbols are eight, all paying out with a minimum combination of three and a maximum of five. The J to A cards, which are good for a royal flush, are the lower-paying symbols, while the candy symbols are much more lucrative. In order of increasing value, we have the blue, green, red, and finally, the purple ones.\n\nThe star symbol is the wild, replacing all symbols except the diamond, and can only appear on reels 2 to 4. If the wild appears on the horizontal reel, it is associated with an initial multiplier of x1. It remains fixed on the reel during the cascade, and with each winning combination, its multiplier increases by one.\n\nThe diamond is our scatter, and with three symbols, we get eight free spins. During the bonus game, each spin guarantees the presence of a wild on the horizontal reel. Unlike the base game, the multiplier starts at x2 and instead of increasing by +1 after every cascade, it is doubled. This function can also be purchased.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow many consecutive cascades can happen in a single spin?\n\nIn theory, infinite, but the multiplier stops at 128. If the cascading continues, that is the value applied to the winnings. \n\nIf I purchase the Bonus game, does the RTP value remain the same?\n\nNo, in this case, it drops slightly to 96.26%.\n\nAre there scatters and wilds?\n\nYes, both are present, and during the free spins, the wild that appears on the horizontal reel doubles the value of its multiplier. \n\nExperience the sweet rewards of \"Candy Stars\" for yourself and try your luck at this potentially lucrative slot game.\n            ",

Before analyzing the game's features, let's take a look at the theme and graphics. As the title suggests, the game's theme is candy of different shapes and colors, including red, purple, and green spheres and triangular candies. Even the non-themed symbols, like playing cards, have round shapes reminiscent of delectable sweets.\n\nThe game grid has a blue background with lights and glows of varying shades of purple and blue. The buttons are all located at the bottom of the screen, leaving ample space for the game grid.\n\nRegarding the soundtrack, it is an electronic motif typically from the 80s. \n\nA Potentially Significant Win\n\nThe game grid consists of five reels and three rows, plus an additional horizontal reel at the top. Each spin costs €0.20, with a potential win of up to 5,000 times the bet. Players can also use the Autoplay function to set a certain number of automatic spins.\n\nTo win, match identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards the right. The game's theoretical return to player is 96.47%, and the volatility is high.\n\nBonuses for Every Taste\n\nWhile Candy Stars has simple gameplay, it is far from lacking in bonuses. The system is cascading, meaning that after every paying combination, the winning symbols are removed, the remaining symbols drop down, and new symbols fill the empty positions. The base game symbols are eight, all paying out with a minimum combination of three and a maximum of five. The J to A cards, which are good for a royal flush, are the lower-paying symbols, while the candy symbols are much more lucrative. In order of increasing value, we have the blue, green, red, and finally, the purple ones.\n\nThe star symbol is the wild, replacing all symbols except the diamond, and can only appear on reels 2 to 4. If the wild appears on the horizontal reel, it is associated with an initial multiplier of x1. It remains fixed on the reel during the cascade, and with each winning combination, its multiplier increases by one.\n\nThe diamond is our scatter, and with three symbols, we get eight free spins. During the bonus game, each spin guarantees the presence of a wild on the horizontal reel. Unlike the base game, the multiplier starts at x2 and instead of increasing by +1 after every cascade, it is doubled. This function can also be purchased.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow many consecutive cascades can happen in a single spin?\n\nIn theory, infinite, but the multiplier stops at 128. If the cascading continues, that is the value applied to the winnings. \n\nIf I purchase the Bonus game, does the RTP value remain the same?\n\nNo, in this case, it drops slightly to 96.26%.\n\nAre there scatters and wilds?\n\nYes, both are present, and during the free spins, the wild that appears on the horizontal reel doubles the value of its multiplier. \n\nExperience the sweet rewards of \"Candy Stars\" for yourself and try your luck at this potentially lucrative slot game.\n            ",
