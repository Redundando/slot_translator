This game features 50 fixed paylines, special symbols, four jackpots, and unbeatable free spins with multipliers. All of this is contained within a 3-4-4-4-3 structure with an RTP of 96.49%, allowing for a potential maximum win of 2,000x the bet. Rarestone Gaming has truly created a magnificent game for players to enjoy.\nThe graphics in Crystal Garden are gorgeous, with underwater scenes creating the perfect backdrop for the cartoon-style mermaid character. The Scatter symbol pays out the most, followed by the octopus, dolphin, seahorse, and turtle. The game also includes lower value symbols represented by traditional playing cards that complement the overall design of the game.\nWhat sets Fire Blaze Isla Baja apart from other slot games are its amazing bonus features. The free spins round is triggered when three or more Scatter symbols appear on the reels, allowing players to earn six free spins. During the free spins, the Wild symbols on the center reel have an ideal multiplier, increasing the potential value of the win. The function can also be reactivated at the end of the round, providing the player with additional chances to increase their winnings and making the game even more vivid.\nIf a player finds between seven and fifteen pearls, they unlock the Fire Blaze Hold & Respin feature, which helps them to win a prize of 50 times the total bet.\nOverall, while the game design may not be the most exciting, the Fire Blaze Isla Baja slot game is perfect for those who seek excitement and intrigue through its special features, rather than just the base game. The sea theme is always popular, although it doesn't provide any new features compared to many other titles already on the market.\nFAQs:\nWhat is the potential maximum win value of Fire Blaze Isla Baja?\nThe potential maximum win value is 2,000x the original bet.\nCan I play Fire Blaze Isla Baja slot game for free?\nYes, you can play the demo version of the game from either a computer or mobile device, by selecting one of the online casinos that offer it, or through our portal.\nIs the RTP of Fire Blaze Isla Baja slot game low?\nNo, it is just above 96%, which is the \"minimum\" threshold you should seek before choosing an online slot game.
