The game features eight betting levels, with the minimum being only 0.10€ and the maximum reaching up to 20.00€ per spin. Two options are available to players for boosting their winnings - a card-based bet that offers the chance to choose between red or black, or try and reach the final step of the betting scale. \n\nThe bonus feature can be activated with three or more scatter symbols present, with a randomly selected symbol triggering the free spins. During the free spins, a random symbol will be selected to act as the expanding reel symbol. The goal is to hit enough symbols to expand across the reels and receive a bigger win on the 10 paylines. \n\nThe Bonus Round in Magic Mirror Deluxe 2 can be reactivated and is where players can potentially achieve big wins. If reactivated, another 10 free spins will be awarded along with another symbol from the mirror that can expand further than the initial one.\n\nOverall, Magic Mirror Deluxe 2 is a popular reel expansion game in the fantasy genre that is worth trying in demo mode or with real money.\n        ",
