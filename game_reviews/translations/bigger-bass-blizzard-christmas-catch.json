Le cime innevate degli alberi si muovono sospinte dal vento mentre candidi fiocchi cadono costantemente ai lati della griglia. I simboli di grandi dimensioni hanno colori tenui e sono ricchi di particolari, la musica di sottofondo è caratterizzata da brani strumentali a tema natalizio, un modo per farci vivere appieno l’atmosfera di festa che si respira a ogni Spin.\nLinee di pagamento fisse e puntate contenute\nSu una griglia a 5 rulli e 4 righe si trovano le dodici linee di pagamento fisse, su cui è possibile puntare un minimo di 0,12 €.

Selezionando il moltiplicatore di puntata 18x che si trova alla sinistra dei rulli, si ha una possibilità più alta di ottenere simboli Scatter.\nCi sono due funzioni che accelerano le giocate: la prima è la funzione Turbo fa ruotare i rulli più velocemente, il secondo è l’Autoplay, che li fa girare in modo automatico.\nLa volatilità è alta, mentre il ritorno teorico al giocatore (RTP) è pari al 96,08%.\nTanti simboli e un gioco bonus davvero speciale\nPassiamo ora a vedere in modo dettagliato il gameplay.

Il primo preso in esame è il pesce Denaro, con un valore monetario che cambia a ogni Spin. Esso può essere 2x, 5x e sino a un massimo di 4.000 volte la scommessa. Il pesce all’amo è invece il nostro simbolo Scatter e in base al numero atterrato sui rulli, ci regala 10, 15 o 20 giri gratis. Se per caso sulla griglia atterrano soltanto due Scatter, è possibile che dall’alto cali un amo che aggancia il rullo e lo solleva, dandoci la possibilità di ottenere un ulteriore simbolo e dare così avvio alla funzione Bonus.\nIl pescatore è il nostro Wild e compare soltanto durante i Free Spins. Questo simbolo, oltre a sostituire tutti i simboli eccetto gli Scatter, raccoglie i pesci Denaro apparsi durante la singola giocata. Inoltre, fa avanzare uno speciale contatore che permette di ottenere ulteriori Free Spins e fa aumentare il moltiplicatore da applicare alle vincite.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nPosso giocare a Bigger Blass Blizzard - Christmas Catch anche sul cellulare?\n\nCerto, questa slot è ottimizzata per essere fruita da tablet e smartphone.\n\n\n\nA quanto ammonta il ritorno teorico al giocatore?\n\nIl valore RTP è del 96,08%\n\n\n\nIl simbolo Wild è presente?\n\nSì, ma a differenza di altre slot, in questa compare solo durante i Free Spins ma riveste più funzioni.\n\n\n\n",

There are two functions that speed up the gameplay: the Turbo function that makes the reels spin faster, the second is the Autoplay, which makes them spin automatically. The volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.08%.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nBigger Bass Blizzard – Christmas Catch's graphics and sound are truly stunning. The snow-covered peaks of the trees move, pushed by the wind, while white flakes constantly fall on the sides of the grid. Large-sized symbols have soft colors and are rich in detail, while the background music features instrumental Christmas-themed tracks, a way to fully experience the festive atmosphere that is felt at every spin.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nSymbols can be divided into two main groups, low-level and high-level. The first group includes playing cards from ten to ace, while the second features the theme-related symbols. The Money fish is the first high-level symbol, whose monetary value changes at each spin. It can be 2x, 5x, and up to a maximum of 4,000 times the bet. The fish on the hook is the Scatter symbol and, depending on the number landed on the reels, it gives us 10, 15, or 20 free spins. The angler is the Wild symbol and appears only during Free Spins.

The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.08%, which is comparable to other slots on the market.\n\nSpecial Symbols and Bonus Features\n\nBigger Bass Blizzard – Christmas Catch has a truly special bonus game. If only two Scatter symbols land on the grid, a hook may fall from above, hooking the reel and lifting it, giving us the possibility of obtaining an additional symbol and thus starting the Bonus function. During Free Spins, the angler Wild symbol collects the Money fish that appeared during the single game. In addition, it advances a special counter that allows obtaining additional free spins and increasing the multiplier to be applied to the winnings.\n\n        \n            ",

The snow-covered peaks of the trees move pushed by the wind, while white flakes constantly fall on the sides of the grid. Large-sized symbols have soft colors and are rich in detail, the background music features instrumental Christmas-themed tracks, a way to fully experience the festive atmosphere that is felt at every spin.\nFixed paylines and low stakes\nOn a 5-reel and 4-row grid, there are twelve fixed paylines, on which you can bet a minimum of €0.12. The maximum win is 2,667 times the bet. By selecting the 18x bet multiplier located to the left of the reels, you have a higher chance of getting Scatter symbols.\nThere are two functions that speed up the gameplay: the first is the Turbo function that makes the reels spin faster, the second is the Autoplay, which makes them spin automatically.\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.08%.\nMany symbols and a truly special bonus game\nNow let's take a closer look at the gameplay. Symbols can be divided into two main groups, low-level and high-level. The first group includes playing cards from ten to ace, while the second features the theme-related symbols. The first considered is the Money fish, whose monetary value changes at each spin. It can be 2x, 5x, and up to a maximum of 4,000 times the bet. The fish on the hook, on the other hand, is our Scatter symbol and depending on the number landed on the reels, it gives us 10, 15, or 20 free spins. If by chance, only two Scatters land on the grid, it is possible for a hook to fall from above, hooking the reel and lifting it, giving us the possibility of obtaining an additional symbol and thus starting the Bonus function.\nThe angler is our Wild symbol and appears only during Free Spins. This symbol, in addition to replacing all symbols except Scatters, collects the Money fish that appeared during the single game. Moreover, it advances a special counter that allows obtaining additional free spins and increasing the multiplier to be applied to the winnings.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I play Bigger Bass Blizzard - Christmas Catch on my mobile?\nCertainly, this slot is optimized to be enjoyed on tablets and smartphones.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\nThe RTP value is 96.08%.\n\nIs the Wild symbol present?\nYes, but unlike other slots, it only appears during Free Spins but has more functions.\n            ",

The snow-covered peaks of the trees move pushed by the wind, while white flakes constantly fall on the sides of the grid. Large-sized symbols have soft colors and are rich in detail, the background music features instrumental Christmas-themed tracks, a way to fully experience the festive atmosphere that is felt at every spin.\nFixed paylines and low stakes\nOn a 5-reel and 4-row grid, there are twelve fixed paylines, on which you can bet a minimum of €0.12. The maximum win is 2,667 times the bet. By selecting the 18x bet multiplier located to the left of the reels, you have a higher chance of getting Scatter symbols.\nThere are two functions that speed up the gameplay: the first is the Turbo function that makes the reels spin faster, the second is the Autoplay, which makes them spin automatically.\nThe volatility is high, while the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.08%.\nMany symbols and a truly special bonus game\nNow let's take a closer look at the gameplay. Symbols can be divided into two main groups, low-level and high-level. The first group includes playing cards from ten to ace, while the second features the theme-related symbols. The first considered is the Money fish, whose monetary value changes at each spin. It can be 2x, 5x, and up to a maximum of 4,000 times the bet. The fish on the hook, on the other hand, is our Scatter symbol and depending on the number landed on the reels, it gives us 10, 15, or 20 free spins. If by chance, only two Scatters land on the grid, it is possible for a hook to fall from above, hooking the reel and lifting it, giving us the possibility of obtaining an additional symbol and thus starting the Bonus function.\nThe angler is our Wild symbol and appears only during Free Spins. This symbol, in addition to replacing all symbols except Scatters, collects the Money fish that appeared during the single game. Moreover, it advances a special counter that allows obtaining additional free spins and increasing the multiplier to be applied to the winnings.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I play Bigger Bass Blizzard - Christmas Catch on my mobile?\nCertainly, this slot is optimized to be enjoyed on tablets and smartphones.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\nThe RTP value is 96.08%.\n\nIs the Wild symbol present?\nYes, but unlike other slots, it only appears during Free Spins but has more functions.\n            ",
