With a dragon theme, it comes with cascading reels as well as xNudge Wilds that give you multipliers up to 6x and wild reels. There are mysterious symbols that expand the number of ways to win up to 20,736. In the Dragon Spins feature, you choose between 2 modes - the extreme version utilizes all features and can pay up to 27,000 x bets per free spin!\n\nA fantasy graphics\n\nPlay in the colorful world of dragons and magic, where the xWays machine can offer winnings up to 20,376 winning combinations. Nolimit City's slot machine experts have included a set of features. In addition to the two Wild symbols and extra spins, Dragon Tribe has a gauge on the left side of the reel that counts consecutive wins.\n\nWhile the engine is completely different from the Wicked Dragon Wilds slot, there are some similarities in the theme. Dragon Tribe is a stunning-looking game that has superb graphics and animations - however, the first thing you'll notice is the epic soundtrack, which is heard as the reels spin. With flames and dragons flying in the background, it has a prehistoric look.\n\nAmong the symbols, there are Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jacks (made of bones) and 5 different cartoon-style dragons. There's also a red-haired female character - she's the most valuable symbol with 3, 4, 5, or 6 in combination giving you 0.5, 1.25, 2.5 or 3.75 times your stake.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nThe game pays out from the leftmost and right-most reel with three or more of the same symbols plus the wild. Two matching symbols or a symbol and a wild character can be present on the same reel and give rise to a win if the next reel encounters that matching symbol or a wild character and then a matching symbol.\n\nThose who have played Megaways slots before will have no difficulty understanding how xWays work, as it is virtually the same. The Dragon Tribe slot offers a myriad of image symbols that include the high paying category and the cards paying smaller amounts.\n\nThe most profitable symbol to get in six positions is the girl. The optimal result without any multiplier translates to 3.75x multiplied by the triggering bet. The rest of the symbols bring smaller wins. \n\nNow, this is not the most exciting paytable in terms of what you can get for a win, however, the game deals with bonus features and reel modifiers. Here the two wild symbols can be very useful, as can the multipliers. Without these, Dragon Tribe can only provide thin pickings.\n\nAs suggested above, there are two wilds that can come into play at any time. The xNudge Wild can only stop on the three middle reels. When in play, each consecutive win with the wild increases the multiplier amount for that result and this can go up to x6 on the win.\n\nThe wild moves one row per spin. When it lands on the bottom row of the reel, it expands on the reel. These symbols can multiply each other if more than one affects the result on the reels.\n\nThe Dragon Tribe slot’s logo is the game's Scatter that can trigger two types of wilds: Dragon Spins with wins up to 11,000x and Dragon Spins Extreme where volatility is much higher and where both xNudge and xWays features are active, towards potential wins up to 27,000x.\n\nThe smallest bet is 0.20 euros per spin and the biggest is 100.00 euros per spin, with a range of other amounts between these two. The Dragon Tribe slot plays the bet through the initial 4096 ways to pay which can expand to all 20,376.\n\nAs expected, the lines on the reel-set move and shift depending on what happens in the game. In other words, the more consecutive wins, the more ways to pay.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf you want to continue betting your money on Slot Machines produced by Nolimit City, a provider that is still relatively unknown but has much to offer, we recommend trying Pixies vs Pirates slot because it was the first game to use the same game engine and provides a potential payout of 11,907 x bet.",

The game features the xWays function, which is similar to the Megaways slots.\n\nDragon Tribe offers a myriad of image symbols comprising the high-paying category and the lower-paying cards. The most profitable symbol to get in six positions is the girl. The optimum outcome without any multiplier results in 3.75x multiplied by the triggering bet. The rest of the symbols bring smaller wins.\n\n With the two wild symbols and the multipliers, Dragon Tribe can provide potential big wins, which can get up to x6, thanks to the xNudge Wild, which increases the multiplier amount for each consecutive win. These symbols can multiply with each other if more than one affects the result on the reels.\n\nThe Dragon Tribe slot's logo is the Scatter of the game that can trigger two types of wilds: Dragon Spins with wins up to 11,000x and Dragon Spins Extreme where volatility is even higher, and where both xNudge and xWays features are active, for potential wins up to 27,000x. \n\nOverall, this is an excellent and exciting game that will appeal to experienced gamblers who enjoy high volatility and dragon-themed games. If you enjoyed this slot game, we recommend trying Pixies vs Pirates, another Nolimit City game that utilizes the same game engine and provides a potential payout of 11,907x stakes."

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nDragon Tribe slot game overview\nVisuals and theme of Dragon Tribe\nFeatures of Dragon Tribe (cascading reels, xNudge Wilds, mysterious symbols)\nNumber of ways to win in Dragon Tribe\nDragon Spins feature in Dragon Tribe (including extreme mode)\nOverall gameplay experience of Dragon Tribe\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Dragon Tribe, crafted by the impressive Nolimit City, is a 6-reel, 4,096 ways to win slot game that can be played on all devices from 0.20€ to 100€ per spin. With a dragon theme, it comes with cascading reels as well as xNudge Wilds that give you multipliers up to 6x and wild reels. There are mysterious symbols that expand the number of ways to win up to 20,736. In the Dragon Spins feature, you choose between 2 modes - the extreme version utilizes all features and can pay up to 27,000 x bets per free spin!\n\nA fantasy graphics\n\nPlay in the colorful world of dragons and magic, where the xWays machine can offer winnings up to 20,376 winning combinations. Nolimit City's slot machine experts have included a set of features. In addition to the two Wild symbols and extra spins, Dragon Tribe has a gauge on the left side of the reel that counts consecutive wins.\n\nWhile the engine is completely different from the Wicked Dragon Wilds slot, there are some similarities in the theme. Dragon Tribe is a stunning-looking game that has superb graphics and animations - however, the first thing you'll notice is the epic soundtrack, which is heard as the reels spin. With flames and dragons flying in the background, it has a prehistoric look.\n\nAmong the symbols, there are Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jacks (made of bones) and 5 different cartoon-style dragons. There's also a red-haired female character - she's the most valuable symbol with 3, 4, 5, or 6 in combination giving you 0.5, 1.25, 2.5 or 3.75 times your stake.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nThe game pays out from the leftmost and right-most reel with three or more of the same symbols plus the wild. Two matching symbols or a symbol and a wild character can be present on the same reel and give rise to a win if the next reel encounters that matching symbol or a wild character and then a matching symbol.\n\nThose who have played Megaways slots before will have no difficulty understanding how xWays work, as it is virtually the same. The Dragon Tribe slot offers a myriad of image symbols that include the high paying category and the cards paying smaller amounts.\n\nThe most profitable symbol to get in six positions is the girl. The optimal result without any multiplier translates to 3.75x multiplied by the triggering bet. The rest of the symbols bring smaller wins. \n\nNow, this is not the most exciting paytable in terms of what you can get for a win, however, the game deals with bonus features and reel modifiers. Here the two wild symbols can be very useful, as can the multipliers. Without these, Dragon Tribe can only provide thin pickings.\n\nAs suggested above, there are two wilds that can come into play at any time. The xNudge Wild can only stop on the three middle reels. When in play, each consecutive win with the wild increases the multiplier amount for that result and this can go up to x6 on the win.\n\nThe wild moves one row per spin. When it lands on the bottom row of the reel, it expands on the reel. These symbols can multiply each other if more than one affects the result on the reels.\n\nThe Dragon Tribe slot’s logo is the game's Scatter that can trigger two types of wilds: Dragon Spins with wins up to 11,000x and Dragon Spins Extreme where volatility is much higher and where both xNudge and xWays features are active, towards potential wins up to 27,000x.\n\nThe smallest bet is 0.20 euros per spin and the biggest is 100.00 euros per spin, with a range of other amounts between these two. The Dragon Tribe slot plays the bet through the initial 4096 ways to pay which can expand to all 20,376.\n\nAs expected, the lines on the reel-set move and shift depending on what happens in the game. In other words, the more consecutive wins, the more ways to pay.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf you want to continue betting your money on Slot Machines produced by Nolimit City, a provider that is still relatively unknown but has much to offer, we recommend trying Pixies vs Pirates slot because it was the first game to use the same game engine and provides a potential payout of 11,907 x bet.\n            ",

There are mysterious symbols that expand the number of ways to win up to 20,736. Additionally, in the Dragon Spins feature, you choose between 2 modes - the extreme version utilizes all features and can pay up to 27,000x bets per free spin.\n\nVisual Design\n\nDragon Tribe has stunning graphics and animations that transport you to a colorful world of dragons and magic. The symbols include Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jacks, and 5 different cartoon-style dragons along with a red-haired female character. Furthermore, the epic soundtrack adds to the prehistoric look of the game with flames and dragons flying in the background.\n\nWays to Win and Betting Range\n\nDragon Tribe's paylines payout from both the leftmost and right-most reel, with three or more matching symbols or wilds. The smallest bet that can be placed is 0.20€, and the largest is 100€ with a range of other amounts available in between. In the initial 4096 ways to pay, players can win up to 20,736 ways if consecutive wins occur.\n\nAvailability on Multiple Devices\n\nDragon Tribe is available on all devices, including desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, allowing players to enjoy the game from anywhere.\n\nDragon Theme\n\nDragon Tribe is a slot game that revolves around the theme of dragons. Nolimit City has incorporated various dragon symbols and characters into the game to create an immersive dragon-themed gaming experience.\n\nWin Potential\n\nDragon Tribe provides ample opportunities for players to win big. The game has a return to player (RTP) rate of 96.06%, which is quite high. The Dragon Spins feature can potentially pay up to 27,000x bets per free spin. Additionally, the xNudge Wilds can increase multipliers up to 6x, and there are also mysterious symbols that expand the number of ways to win up to 20,736. Players can win up to 3.75x multiplied by the triggering bet with the most profitable symbol to get in six positions being the red-haired female character. However, the game deals with bonus features and reel modifiers, and without these, Dragon Tribe can only provide thin winnings.\n\n        \n            ",

It can be played on all devices from 0.20€ to 100€ per spin.\n\nVisuals and Theme of Dragon Tribe\n\nDragon Tribe has a fantasy theme with a colorful world of dragons and magic. It features superb graphics and animations, and the epic soundtrack is heard as the reels spin. With flames and dragons flying in the background, it has a prehistoric look. The symbols include Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, 5 different cartoon-style dragons, and a red-haired female character.\n\nFeatures of Dragon Tribe (Cascading Reels, xNudge Wilds, Mysterious Symbols)\n\nDragon Tribe features cascading reels that can offer winnings up to 20,736 winning combinations. There are xNudge Wilds that give you multipliers up to 6x and wild reels. Mysterious symbols expand the number of ways to win up to 20,736. There are two Wild symbols and extra spins, and a gauge on the left side of the reel that counts consecutive wins.\n\nNumber of Ways to Win in Dragon Tribe\n\nDragon Tribe has 4,096 ways to win initially, but the number of ways to win can expand up to 20,736 using mysterious symbols. The lines on the reel-set move and shift depending on what happens in the game, so the more consecutive wins, the more ways to pay.\n\nDragon Spins Feature in Dragon Tribe (Including Extreme Mode)\n\nThe Dragon Spins feature in Dragon Tribe is triggered by the game's Scatter, which is the Dragon Tribe slot’s logo. There are two types of Dragon Spins: Dragon Spins mode offers wins up to 11,000x, and Dragon Spins Extreme mode has much higher volatility and both xNudge and xWays features are active, offering potential wins up to 27,000x.\n\nOverall Gameplay Experience of Dragon Tribe\n\nDragon Tribe is a stunning-looking game that offers potential winnings up to 27,000x. It may not have the most exciting paytable, but the game deals with bonus features and reel modifiers. The two Wild symbols, xNudge Wilds, and multipliers can provide thin pickings.

With a dragon theme, it comes with cascading reels as well as xNudge Wilds that give you multipliers up to 6x and wild reels. There are mysterious symbols that expand the number of ways to win up to 20,736. In the Dragon Spins feature, you choose between 2 modes - the extreme version utilizes all features and can pay up to 27,000 x bets per free spin!\n\nA fantasy graphics\n\nPlay in the colorful world of dragons and magic, where the xWays machine can offer winnings up to 20,376 winning combinations. Nolimit City's slot machine experts have included a set of features. In addition to the two Wild symbols and extra spins, Dragon Tribe has a gauge on the left side of the reel that counts consecutive wins.\n\nWhile the engine is completely different from the Wicked Dragon Wilds slot, there are some similarities in the theme. Dragon Tribe is a stunning-looking game that has superb graphics and animations - however, the first thing you'll notice is the epic soundtrack, which is heard as the reels spin. With flames and dragons flying in the background, it has a prehistoric look.\n\nAmong the symbols, there are Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jacks (made of bones) and 5 different cartoon-style dragons. There's also a red-haired female character - she's the most valuable symbol with 3, 4, 5, or 6 in combination giving you 0.5, 1.25, 2.5 or 3.75 times your stake.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nThe game pays out from the leftmost and right-most reel with three or more of the same symbols plus the wild. Two matching symbols or a symbol and a wild character can be present on the same reel and give rise to a win if the next reel encounters that matching symbol or a wild character and then a matching symbol.\n\nThose who have played Megaways slots before will have no difficulty understanding how xWays work, as it is virtually the same. The Dragon Tribe slot offers a myriad of image symbols that include the high paying category and the cards paying smaller amounts.\n\nThe most profitable symbol to get in six positions is the girl. The optimal result without any multiplier translates to 3.75x multiplied by the triggering bet. The rest of the symbols bring smaller wins. \n\nNow, this is not the most exciting paytable in terms of what you can get for a win, however, the game deals with bonus features and reel modifiers. Here the two wild symbols can be very useful, as can the multipliers. Without these, Dragon Tribe can only provide thin pickings.\n\nAs suggested above, there are two wilds that can come into play at any time. The xNudge Wild can only stop on the three middle reels. When in play, each consecutive win with the wild increases the multiplier amount for that result and this can go up to x6 on the win.\n\nThe wild moves one row per spin. When it lands on the bottom row of the reel, it expands on the reel. These symbols can multiply each other if more than one affects the result on the reels.\n\nThe Dragon Tribe slot’s logo is the game's Scatter that can trigger two types of wilds: Dragon Spins with wins up to 11,000x and Dragon Spins Extreme where volatility is much higher and where both xNudge and xWays features are active, towards potential wins up to 27,000x.\n\nThe smallest bet is 0.20 euros per spin and the biggest is 100.00 euros per spin, with a range of other amounts between these two. The Dragon Tribe slot plays the bet through the initial 4096 ways to pay which can expand to all 20,376.\n\nAs expected, the lines on the reel-set move and shift depending on what happens in the game. In other words, the more consecutive wins, the more ways to pay.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf you want to continue betting your money on Slot Machines produced by Nolimit City, a provider that is still relatively unknown but has much to offer, we recommend trying Pixies vs Pirates slot because it was the first game to use the same game engine and provides a potential payout of 11,907 x bet.\n            ",

In the Dragon Spins feature, you choose between 2 modes - the extreme version utilizes all features and can pay up to 27,000 x bets per free spin!\n\nA fantasy graphics\n\nPlay in the colorful world of dragons and magic, where the xWays machine can offer winnings up to 20,376 winning combinations. Nolimit City's slot machine experts have included a set of features. In addition to the two Wild symbols and extra spins, Dragon Tribe has a gauge on the left side of the reel that counts consecutive wins.\n\nWhile the engine is completely different from the Wicked Dragon Wilds slot, there are some similarities in the theme. Dragon Tribe is a stunning-looking game that has superb graphics and animations - however, the first thing you'll notice is the epic soundtrack, which is heard as the reels spin. With flames and dragons flying in the background, it has a prehistoric look.\n\nAmong the symbols, there are Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jacks (made of bones) and 5 different cartoon-style dragons. There's also a red-haired female character - she's the most valuable symbol with 3, 4, 5, or 6 in combination giving you 0.5, 1.25, 2.5 or 3.75 times your stake.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nThe game pays out from the leftmost and right-most reel with three or more of the same symbols plus the wild. Two matching symbols or a symbol and a wild character can be present on the same reel and give rise to a win if the next reel encounters that matching symbol or a wild character and then a matching symbol.\n\nThose who have played Megaways slots before will have no difficulty understanding how xWays work, as it is virtually the same. The Dragon Tribe slot offers a myriad of image symbols that include the high paying category and the cards paying smaller amounts.\n\nThe most profitable symbol to get in six positions is the girl. The optimal result without any multiplier translates to 3.75x multiplied by the triggering bet. The rest of the symbols bring smaller wins. \n\nNow, this is not the most exciting paytable in terms of what you can get for a win, however, the game deals with bonus features and reel modifiers. Here the two wild symbols can be very useful, as can the multipliers. Without these, Dragon Tribe can only provide thin pickings.\n\nAs suggested above, there are two wilds that can come into play at any time. The xNudge Wild can only stop on the three middle reels. When in play, each consecutive win with the wild increases the multiplier amount for that result and this can go up to x6 on the win.\n\nThe wild moves one row per spin. When it lands on the bottom row of the reel, it expands on the reel. These symbols can multiply each other if more than one affects the result on the reels.\n\nThe Dragon Tribe slot’s logo is the game's Scatter that can trigger two types of wilds: Dragon Spins with wins up to 11,000x and Dragon Spins Extreme where volatility is much higher and where both xNudge and xWays features are active, towards potential wins up to 27,000x.\n\nThe smallest bet is 0.20 euros per spin and the biggest is 100.00 euros per spin, with a range of other amounts between these two. The Dragon Tribe slot plays the bet through the initial 4096 ways to pay which can expand to all 20,376.\n\nAs expected, the lines on the reel-set move and shift depending on what happens in the game. In other words, the more consecutive wins, the more ways to pay.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf you want to continue betting your money on Slot Machines produced by Nolimit City, a provider that is still relatively unknown but has much to offer, we recommend trying Pixies vs Pirates slot because it was the first game to use the same game engine and provides a potential payout of 11,907 x bet.\n            ",
