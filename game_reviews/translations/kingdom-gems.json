Using classic gameplay, you can earn a myriad of free spins. This medium to high volatility video slot has an RTP of 96%.\n\nProtect the precious gems of ancient Chinese royalty to achieve your goal: winning big prizes without being scared off by majestic dragons!\n\nKingdom Gems Slot: Key Features\n\nLoad up the reels and be blown away by the superb graphics of this 5-reel, 50-payline slot. The gameplay may be classic, but the generous number of paylines supports 12 symbols, including the wild that creates options for new winning combinations.\n\nThe long-term RTP is 96% and offers players a theoretical return of 96 credits for every 100 bets. The volatility is medium to high, giving this slot a wide range of potential wins.\n\nFurthermore, we would like to emphasize that all FBM Gaming's slot demo games are optimized to play on all Android or Apple devices in both vertical and horizontal modes, making the reel spin even more rewarding.\n\nTheme and Design\n\nThe Asian theme is certainly not new, but few can boast the stunning graphics of this romantic adventure inspired by ancient Chinese mythology, where each symbol has been realized in 3D with an animated background that makes the scene even more realistic.\n\nLuck, health, riches are the basic ingredients of this romantic adventure, to which is added a really well-made soundtrack.\n\nSymbols and Payouts\n\nThe most rewarding symbol here is the Golden Dragon symbol which offers you 200 credits if 5 land on a payline. The White Lion symbol follows with a payout of 100 credits if 5 land on a payline.\n\nThe golden symbols of the Turtle, Scorpion, and Frog each award a payout of 100 credits if 5 land on a payline. The Blue-Gold Crocodile awards a winning of 75 credits for 5 of the same kind.\n\nA and K pay 50 credits for 5 identical icons each; Q and J each award a payout of 25 credits for 5 on a payline.\n\nThe Asian male royalty is the wild symbol that replaces all other symbols except the scatter in forming wins which is represented by an Asian girl. This icon offers you a winning of 100 times the bet if you get 5 identical ones. Scatter wins will be paid out based on your total bet.\n\nBonus Features in Gameplay\n\nThis is a finely balanced slot that uses wilds to complete more wins on different paylines and the free spins feature to increase potential.\n\nFREE SPINS FEATURE\n\n3, 4, or 5 scatter symbols pay 2x, 20x, or 100x your bet and activate the free spins feature:\n- 3 scatters unlock 8 free spins;\n- 4 scatters unlock 10 free spins;\n- 5 scatters unlock 12 free spins.\nIf during the free spins feature, you land 3, 4, or 5 scatters, the feature will be reactivated with the same number of FS. During the free spins feature, the J - K royals are removed from the reels. Free games are played with high paying symbols only to increase potential.\n\nFinal Evaluation and Verdict\n\nKingdom Gems is a well-known game not only for the high payout of 96%. There are a number of extra features, including: Wild Symbol, Free Spins, and Scatter Symbols. It's not particularly complex, but if you want to play a classic, well-balanced game with impeccable Asian-themed graphics, you're in the right place!\n\nIf you want to try another free gem-themed slot, we suggest Aztec Stargems by Leap Gaming (available in our library) which offers a maxi bonus all to be discovered...\n\nFAQs\n\nDoes the game Kingdom Gems include bonuses or free spins?\n\nCertainly. The Kingdom Gems slot machine includes bonus features such as wild symbols, free spins, and scatter symbols. You can win up to 12 free spins by landing 3 or more scatter symbols anywhere on the reels.\n\nHow do you play the Kingdom Gems slot demo?\n\nChoose the amount of your bet using the arrows or in the settings. For the Kingdom Gems slot, the minimum bet is 50€ and the maximum bet is 1000€. Now click on spin or choose the auto-spin feature, which allows you to spin the reel more comfortably.
