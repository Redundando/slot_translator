            "response": "The Immortal Fruits slot is a Nolimit City game with 5 reels and 50 paylines. Playable from 20 cents per spin on all devices, it has a disco fever feel with a classic fruit machine vibe. With stacked symbols, it's all about the xWheel feature where there are 3 levels. Each level has 10 winning sections that award multiplier prizes. Land on the Level Up section to move to the next wheel with bigger prizes on offer. The maximum win here is 2,500x your bet from the top level and 2,787x your total bet.\n\nStep back in time to the disco era and traditional fruit machines with Nolimity City's Immortal Fruits. It's a modern interpretation of the classic genre with a touch of modernity. Stacked wilds on the central reels and an xWheel bonus game with three fixed jackpots can lead to wins of up to 2,787 times your bet. An additional twist to the reel action are two gambling features and a bonus buy option in jurisdictions where they are still allowed.\n\nA traditional yet innovative design, Immortal Fruits is played using 5 reels, 4 rows, and 50 fixed paylines. A winning combination pays from left to right starting on reel 1. To win, you need 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols.\n\nThe betting range for Nolimit City slots is generally the same. It's no different with Immortal Fruits as you can play from 20 cents to €100 per spin. With a Turbo mode available for faster spins, there's an Autoplay feature where you can play up to 1,000 auto spins. You can stop it if your balance decreases or increases by a chosen percentage. You can even stop at a single win that exceeds a chosen amount.\n\nThe Immortal Fruits RTP is 96.06%, which is average for an online slot. 60.97% comes in the base game and 35.09% from the xWheel feature. One thing to note is that this is an extremely volatile slot. This is reflected in the hit frequency (how often you'll get a win) as it's a mere 10.95%. The maximum win is 2,787x bet which comes from the xWheel feature.\n\nImmortal Fruits is a video slot with five reels, four rows, and 50 fixed paylines. Wins are awarded only for three or five matching symbols on a line from left to right. You can play the classic fruit machine on desktop or mobile from 0.20 to 100 credits per spin. The game has extreme volatility (10/10) with an RTP of 96.06% and a hit frequency of about 1 in 10 spins. Some operators will offer the slot in the DX1 version with a lower RTP of 94.08%, always read the help files to find out which version you'll be playing.\n\nIf the disco era of the '70s and '80s is what floats your boat, then you'll feel right at home when you load up the game. Of course, classic fruit symbols along with red lucky 7s dominate on the reels. Groovy music and classic reel sounds create the atmosphere, while disco balls and flashy lights set the mood.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe Immortal Fruits slot is a mashup of themes with a disco atmosphere combined with a classic slot machine. You'll immediately recognize the classic elements of slot machines, but it has a very nice soundtrack. With a background featuring a red disco ball, there are sparkling lights around the reels. You'll also see a classic lever on the side of the reels which shows its inspiration.\n\nThe symbols on the reels are grapes, oranges, plums, lemons, and cherries. You'll also see watermelons, strawberries, and lucky red 7s. The lucky red 7 symbol is the most rewarding, giving you 1, 2.5, or 10 times your stake for 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\n\nImmortal Fruits features a wild diamond symbol that substitutes for all symbols except the bonus symbol. It will also only appear on the 3 middle reels (i.e., reels 2, 3, and/or 4).\n\nFinally, it may have a classic slot machine feel, but it was produced using HTML5 technology. This means that Immortal Fruits is compatible with desktop, mobile, and tablet devices that use iOS, Android, and Windows operating systems.\n\nThe main attraction of Immortal Fruits is the xWheel feature. This is triggered by landing the bonus scatter symbol simultaneously on reels 1, 3, and 5. You'll come across what looks like the Wheel of Fortune. With 3 levels, each level contains 10 winning sections. Each section contains a bet multiplier value.\n\nIf you land on the Level Up section, you move to the next wheel that has bigger prizes. There's also a fixed jackpot for each level that increases each time you progress. The jackpot values are as follows:\nQuick Jackpot: 100x your stake;\nMidi Jackpot: 250x your stake;\nMega Jackpot: 2,500x your stake.\n\nThe wheels keep spinning until you land on a section that's already landed on for one of the above-mentioned jackpots. In total, the maximum you can win here is 2,787x your total bet.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nNolimit City has many other games that fit these requirements.

Naturalmente, i classici simboli della frutta insieme ai 7 rossi dominano sui rulli. La musica groovy e i classici suoni delle bobine creano l’atmosfera, mentre le palle da discoteca e le luci appariscenti creano l’atmosfera dell’ambiente.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nLa slot Immortal Fruits è un mashup di temi e ha un’atmosfera da discoteca abbinata a una classica slot machine. Riconoscerete immediatamente gli elementi classici delle slot machine, ma ha una colonna sonora molto bella. Con lo sfondo raffigurante una palla da discoteca rossa, ci sono luci scintillanti intorno ai rulli. Vedrete anche una classica leva a lato dei rulli che mostra la sua ispirazione.\nI simboli sui rulli sono l’uva, le arance, le prugne, i limoni e le ciliegie. Vedrete anche angurie, fragole e fortunati 7 rossi. Il simbolo del fortunato rosso 7 è il più gratificante dandovi 1, 2,5 o 10 x paletto per 3, 4 o 5 in combinazione.\nImmortal Fruits è dotato di un simbolo di diamante selvatico che sostituisce tutti i simboli tranne il simbolo del bonus. Inoltre, apparirà solo sulle 3 bobine intermedie (cioè le bobine 2, 3 e/o 4).\nInfine, può avere una classica sensazione da slot machine, ma è stato prodotto utilizzando la tecnologia HTML5. Ciò significa che Immortal Fruits è compatibile con i dispositivi desktop, mobili e tablet che utilizzano i sistemi operativi iOS, Android e Windows.\nL’attrazione principale di Immortal Fruits è la funzione xWheel. Questa si attiva facendo atterrare contemporaneamente il simbolo dello scatter bonus sulle bobine 1, 3 e 5. Vi imbatterete in quella che sembra la Ruota della Fortuna. Con 3 livelli, ogni livello contiene 10 sezioni vincenti. Ogni sezione contiene un valore moltiplicatore di puntate.\nSe atterri sulla sezione Level Up, ti sposti alla ruota successiva che ha premi più grandi. C’è anche un jackpot fisso per ogni livello che aumenta ogni volta che si avanza. I valori del jackpot sono i seguenti:\nJackpot rapido: 100x la tua puntata;\nJackpot Midi: 250x la tua puntata;\nMega Jackpot: 2.500x la tua puntata.\nSi continua a far girare le ruote fino ad atterrare su una sezione già atterrata di uno dei jackpot sopra menzionati. In totale, il massimo che puoi vincere qui è 2.787x la tua puntata totale.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nNolimit City ha molti altri giochi che si adattano a queste esigenze. L’eccellente slot Golden Genie and the Walking Wilds ha molti bonus extra e un potenziale di vincita molto più grande. Così come la slot Deadwood, che secondo me è la loro migliore uscita.\n\n        ",

Playable from 20 cents per spin on all devices, it has a disco fever feel with a classic fruit machine vibe. With stacked symbols, it's all about the xWheel feature where there are 3 levels. Each level has 10 winning sections that award multiplier prizes. Land on the Level Up section to move to the next wheel with bigger prizes on offer. The maximum win here is 2,500x your bet from the top level and 2,787x your total bet.\n\nStep back in time to the disco era and traditional fruit machines with Nolimity City's Immortal Fruits. It's a modern interpretation of the classic genre with a touch of modernity. Stacked wilds on the central reels and an xWheel bonus game with three fixed jackpots can lead to wins of up to 2,787 times your bet. An additional twist to the reel action are two gambling features and a bonus buy option in jurisdictions where they are still allowed.\n\nA traditional yet innovative design, Immortal Fruits is played using 5 reels, 4 rows, and 50 fixed paylines. A winning combination pays from left to right starting on reel 1. To win, you need 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols.\n\nThe betting range for Nolimit City slots is generally the same. It's no different with Immortal Fruits as you can play from 20 cents to €100 per spin. With a Turbo mode available for faster spins, there's an Autoplay feature where you can play up to 1,000 auto spins. You can stop it if your balance decreases or increases by a chosen percentage. You can even stop at a single win that exceeds a chosen amount.\n\nThe Immortal Fruits RTP is 96.06%, which is average for an online slot. 60.97% comes in the base game and 35.09% from the xWheel feature. One thing to note is that this is an extremely volatile slot. This is reflected in the hit frequency (how often you'll get a win) as it's a mere 10.95%. The maximum win is 2,787x bet which comes from the xWheel feature.\n\nImmortal Fruits is a video slot with five reels, four rows, and 50 fixed paylines. Wins are awarded only for three or five matching symbols on a line from left to right. You can play the classic fruit machine on desktop or mobile from 0.20 to 100 credits per spin. The game has extreme volatility (10/10) with an RTP of 96.06% and a hit frequency of about 1 in 10 spins. Some operators will offer the slot in the DX1 version with a lower RTP of 94.08%, always read the help files to find out which version you'll be playing.\n\nIf the disco era of the '70s and '80s is what floats your boat, then you'll feel right at home when you load up the game. Of course, classic fruit symbols along with red lucky 7s dominate on the reels. Groovy music and classic reel sounds create the atmosphere, while disco balls and flashy lights set the mood.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe Immortal Fruits slot is a mashup of themes with a disco atmosphere combined with a classic slot machine. You'll immediately recognize the classic elements of slot machines, but it has a very nice soundtrack. With a background featuring a red disco ball, there are sparkling lights around the reels. You'll also see a classic lever on the side of the reels which shows its inspiration.\n\nThe symbols on the reels are grapes, oranges, plums, lemons, and cherries. You'll also see watermelons, strawberries, and lucky red 7s. The lucky red 7 symbol is the most rewarding, giving you 1, 2.5, or 10 times your stake for 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\n\nImmortal Fruits features a wild diamond symbol that substitutes for all symbols except the bonus symbol. It will also only appear on the 3 middle reels (i.e., reels 2, 3, and/or 4).\n\nFinally, it may have a classic slot machine feel, but it was produced using HTML5 technology. This means that Immortal Fruits is compatible with desktop, mobile, and tablet devices that use iOS, Android, and Windows operating systems.\n\nThe main attraction of Immortal Fruits is the xWheel feature. This is triggered by landing the bonus scatter symbol simultaneously on reels 1, 3, and 5. You'll come across what looks like the Wheel of Fortune. With 3 levels, each level contains 10 winning sections. Each section contains a bet multiplier value.\n\nIf you land on the Level Up section, you move to the next wheel that has bigger prizes. There's also a fixed jackpot for each level that increases each time you progress. The jackpot values are as follows:\nQuick Jackpot: 100x your stake;\nMidi Jackpot: 250x your stake;\nMega Jackpot: 2,500x your stake.\n\nThe wheels keep spinning until you land on a section that's already landed on for one of the above-mentioned jackpots. In total, the maximum you can win here is 2,787x your total bet.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nNolimit City has many other games that fit these requirements. The excellent Golden Genie and the Walking Wilds slot has many extra bonuses and a much larger winning potential. As well as the Deadwood slot, which I think is their best release.\n            ",

The wild symbols will only appear on the 3 middle reels (i.e., reels 2, 3, and/or 4).\n\nStacked Symbols\n\nIn Immortal Fruits, stacked wilds are present on the central reels.

It's a modern interpretation of the classic genre with a touch of modernity.

An additional twist to the reel action are two gambling features and a bonus buy option in jurisdictions where they are still allowed.\n\nA traditional yet innovative design, Immortal Fruits is played using 5 reels, 4 rows, and 50 fixed paylines. A winning combination pays from left to right starting on reel 1. To win, you need 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols.\n\nThe betting range for Nolimit City slots is generally the same. It's no different with Immortal Fruits as you can play from 20 cents to €100 per spin.

The game has extreme volatility (10/10) with an RTP of 96.06% and a hit frequency of about 1 in 10 spins. Some operators will offer the slot in the DX1 version with a lower RTP of 94.08%, always read the help files to find out which version you'll be playing.\n\nIf the disco era of the '70s and '80s is what floats your boat, then you'll feel right at home when you load up the game. Of course, classic fruit symbols along with red lucky 7s dominate on the reels. Groovy music and classic reel sounds create the atmosphere, while disco balls and flashy lights set the mood.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe Immortal Fruits slot is a mashup of themes with a disco atmosphere combined with a classic slot machine. You'll immediately recognize the classic elements of slot machines, but it has a very nice soundtrack. With a background featuring a red disco ball, there are sparkling lights around the reels. You'll also see a classic lever on the side of the reels which shows its inspiration.\n\nThe symbols on the reels are grapes, oranges, plums, lemons, and cherries. You'll also see watermelons, strawberries, and lucky red 7s. The lucky red 7 symbol is the most rewarding, giving you 1, 2.5, or 10 times your stake for 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\n\nImmortal Fruits features a wild diamond symbol that substitutes for all symbols except the bonus symbol. It will also only appear on the 3 middle reels (i.e., reels 2, 3, and/or 4).\n\nFinally, it may have a classic slot machine feel, but it was produced using HTML5 technology.

In total, the maximum you can win here is 2,787x your total bet.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nNolimit City has many other games that fit these requirements.

Playable from 20 cents per spin on all devices, it has a disco fever feel with a classic fruit machine vibe. With stacked symbols, it's all about the xWheel feature where there are 3 levels. Each level has 10 winning sections that award multiplier prizes. Land on the Level Up section to move to the next wheel with bigger prizes on offer. The maximum win here is 2,500x your bet from the top level and 2,787x your total bet.\n\nStep back in time to the disco era and traditional fruit machines with Nolimity City's Immortal Fruits. It's a modern interpretation of the classic genre with a touch of modernity. Stacked wilds on the central reels and an xWheel bonus game with three fixed jackpots can lead to wins of up to 2,787 times your bet. An additional twist to the reel action are two gambling features and a bonus buy option in jurisdictions where they are still allowed.\n\nA traditional yet innovative design, Immortal Fruits is played using 5 reels, 4 rows, and 50 fixed paylines. A winning combination pays from left to right starting on reel 1. To win, you need 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols.\n\nThe betting range for Nolimit City slots is generally the same. It's no different with Immortal Fruits as you can play from 20 cents to €100 per spin. With a Turbo mode available for faster spins, there's an Autoplay feature where you can play up to 1,000 auto spins. You can stop it if your balance decreases or increases by a chosen percentage. You can even stop at a single win that exceeds a chosen amount.\n\nThe Immortal Fruits RTP is 96.06%, which is average for an online slot. 60.97% comes in the base game and 35.09% from the xWheel feature. One thing to note is that this is an extremely volatile slot. This is reflected in the hit frequency (how often you'll get a win) as it's a mere 10.95%. The maximum win is 2,787x bet which comes from the xWheel feature.\n\nImmortal Fruits is a video slot with five reels, four rows, and 50 fixed paylines. Wins are awarded only for three or five matching symbols on a line from left to right. You can play the classic fruit machine on desktop or mobile from 0.20 to 100 credits per spin. The game has extreme volatility (10/10) with an RTP of 96.06% and a hit frequency of about 1 in 10 spins. Some operators will offer the slot in the DX1 version with a lower RTP of 94.08%, always read the help files to find out which version you'll be playing.\n\nIf the disco era of the '70s and '80s is what floats your boat, then you'll feel right at home when you load up the game. Of course, classic fruit symbols along with red lucky 7s dominate on the reels. Groovy music and classic reel sounds create the atmosphere, while disco balls and flashy lights set the mood.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe Immortal Fruits slot is a mashup of themes with a disco atmosphere combined with a classic slot machine. You'll immediately recognize the classic elements of slot machines, but it has a very nice soundtrack. With a background featuring a red disco ball, there are sparkling lights around the reels. You'll also see a classic lever on the side of the reels which shows its inspiration.\n\nThe symbols on the reels are grapes, oranges, plums, lemons, and cherries. You'll also see watermelons, strawberries, and lucky red 7s. The lucky red 7 symbol is the most rewarding, giving you 1, 2.5, or 10 times your stake for 3, 4, or 5 in combination.\n\nImmortal Fruits features a wild diamond symbol that substitutes for all symbols except the bonus symbol. It will also only appear on the 3 middle reels (i.e., reels 2, 3, and/or 4).\n\nFinally, it may have a classic slot machine feel, but it was produced using HTML5 technology. This means that Immortal Fruits is compatible with desktop, mobile, and tablet devices that use iOS, Android, and Windows operating systems.\n\nThe main attraction of Immortal Fruits is the xWheel feature. This is triggered by landing the bonus scatter symbol simultaneously on reels 1, 3, and 5. You'll come across what looks like the Wheel of Fortune. With 3 levels, each level contains 10 winning sections. Each section contains a bet multiplier value.\n\nIf you land on the Level Up section, you move to the next wheel that has bigger prizes. There's also a fixed jackpot for each level that increases each time you progress. The jackpot values are as follows:\nQuick Jackpot: 100x your stake;\nMidi Jackpot: 250x your stake;\nMega Jackpot: 2,500x your stake.\n\nThe wheels keep spinning until you land on a section that's already landed on for one of the above-mentioned jackpots. In total, the maximum you can win here is 2,787x your total bet.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nNolimit City has many other games that fit these requirements. The excellent Golden Genie and the Walking Wilds slot has many extra bonuses and a much larger winning potential. As well as the Deadwood slot, which I think is their best release.\n        ",
