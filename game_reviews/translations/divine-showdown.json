For the player spinning the reels on this new slot from Play 'N Go, what happens is a rain of coins and tons of fun!\n\nThe theme, therefore, is that of legends and deities and on the reels, you will see four of them alternate: the mythical Thor, the Asian monkey king Wukong, the goddess of ancient Greece Athena, and finally the Egyptian god Anubis, with features halfway between human and canine.\n\nThe graphic compartment of Divine Showdown is very refined, with images that nod to Hollywood blockbusters and an epic background, with mountains and temples that surround the reels on the game screen.\n\nGame features\n\nDivine Showdown, from a gameplay structure point of view, is not a particularly elaborate slot machine: it has five reels, twenty paylines, and a betting range that goes from a minimum of 20 cents up to a maximum of € 100 per spin, while the token value is between € 0.01 and € 10.\n\nPlay 'N Go has always distinguished itself for the quality of its products and Divine Showdown is another confirmation of this: although it has a simple gameplay, it manages to be fun and engaging, and offers the possibility of earning considerable sums thanks to high volatility.\n\nDivine Showdown includes several special features, among which the most interesting is undoubtedly that of the multiplier reel, which allows you to get the maximum prize equal to a whopping 5,000 times the initial bet, which adding up equals the amount of € 50,000, not bad at all! \n\nThe return-to-player (RTP) of Divine Showdown is variable, ranging from 94.5% to 96.51%, in line with most online casino games.\n\nSymbols and special features\n\nThe symbols of Divine Showdown include, in addition to the four deities, also the numbers and letters corresponding to the playing cards from 10 to Ace, the so-called \"royals,\" plus a symbol depicting a sword that represents the Wild of the game.\n\nThere is also a Scatter that offers the possibility of obtaining a variable number of free spins.\n\nRegarding special functions, in addition to the one already mentioned, we have the random Power Spin feature: during spins, randomly, one of the four deities will help the player with his power and allow him to increase his winnings:\n\nWukong the monkey will increase the number of wilds on the reels.\nAnubis will transform one or two symbols into Wild.\nGoddess Athena will make the same symbol appear on three adjacent reels.\nThe Norwegian god Thor will make every other deity be replaced by his symbol and adopt its value.\n\nGet ready to experience the divine powers and great payouts with Divine Showdown!\n        ",
