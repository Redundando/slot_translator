Additional symbols on the reels are a lotus flower, a red fish, a doll, and the coin with the number 138, which is the highest-valued symbol offering a payout up to 3,888 times the bet amount. The game's special symbols include a coin engraved with a dragon image that plays a significant role in winning combinations.\n\nAccessibility and Compatibility\n\nDragon's Luck Power Reels is an online slot game optimized for play on desktop computers as well as on all iOS and Android mobile devices.

There are those based on myths and legends (such as the Monkey King myth), those that celebrate martial arts, and even those that feature oriental culinary culture on the reels. Like Ancient Egypt themed slots, we can't complain about a lack of similar games!\n\nRed Tiger Gaming, however, is known for their unconventional slot machines, always adding unique features to the gameplay and supporting it with graphics that are usually well-crafted. \n\nDragon's Luck Power Reels is a very bright slot, where the theme of Chinese tradition and the figure of the dragon are represented in a consistent and visually appealing manner. The reels are located inside a pagoda-style building flanked by pillars with dragon images. Even the symbols are represented in Chinese style, with a homogeneous style that makes the gaming experience particularly engaging.\n\nGameplay Features\n\nAs Red Tiger Gaming is known for sophisticated and technologically advanced graphics, they also pay attention to the gameplay, which always has at least one distinctive feature or functionality that sets it apart from more traditional slots.\n\nIn the case of Dragon's Luck Power Reels, the first distinctive feature we can find is the presence of 10 reels and 30 paylines, offering plenty of opportunities to obtain winning combinations.\nThis slot machine has high volatility (4/5), paying up to 3,888 times the bet value if a combination of ten symbols representing the coin with the number 138 is obtained, which is the highest-valued symbol.\n\nThe betting range for Dragon's Luck Power Reels is between only 20 cents and 20€, a relatively small amount that makes this slot suitable for beginners or those who do not like to invest large sums.\n\nAs for the theoretical return to the player (return to player or RTP), it is set at 96.01%, which is in line with the majority of slot games.\n\nDragon's Luck Power Reels is optimized to be played not only on desktop computers but also on all iOS and Android mobile devices.\n\nSymbols in Dragon's Luck Power Reels\n\nThe symbols in Dragon's Luck Power Reels include the so-called royals, i.e., the numbers and letters that refer to playing cards reproduced here in Chinese ideogram style.\n\nIn addition to these, on the reels are a lotus flower, a red fish, a doll, and the coin with the number 138, which is the highest-valued symbol.\n\nAmong the special symbols, we also find a coin engraved with the image of a dragon, which plays a role in obtaining winning combinations.\n        ",
