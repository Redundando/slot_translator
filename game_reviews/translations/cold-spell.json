The snowy mountains in the background highlight the dangerous journey that you face.\n\nA quick look at the paytable of this fantasy-themed slot machine shows that the playing card symbols from Ace to 9 pay less. These symbols are followed by a map, a tiara, and a treasure chest. However, it is the characters that bring the Cold Spell online slot to life. The king and ice angel pay the same, with the Fire Wizard heating things up with wins of up to 9,000x your bet.\n\nOur Cold Spell slot review revealed that wins are calculated on 10 paylines. Even if your fingers are numb from the cold, you won't have trouble spinning these ice-covered reels. Coin values range from 0.01 to 1, with a maximum of 10 coins that can be bet on each payline. This means that you can challenge below-zero temperatures starting from 0.10 credits, while those with deeper pockets can bet up to 100 credits per spin.\n\nWrap up warm and get ready for a volatile session. Novomatic has confirmed that the return to player (RTP) of the Cold Spell slot machine is rather low at 95.05%. The Austrian gambling giant has also revealed that this is a high-volatility online slot. However, with wins of up to 9,000x your bet line on offer, how could you refuse a trip to this medieval realm?\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe Fire Wizard is the key to experiencing the best features of slot machines when playing the Cold Spell slot online. Not only does the Fire Wizard deliver wins of up to 9,000x your bet line as the game's highest paying symbol, but he also represents the Wild symbol. The bold and beautiful Fire Wizard can substitute for all symbols except the Scatters. More importantly, he doubles wins when substituting.\n\nHis magic wand represents the Scatter symbol. You will receive 5x, 20x, or 500x your bet every time you land three, four, or five Scatter symbols respectively. The Fire Wizard will also award 15 free games with all wins multiplied by 3x. Respins are possible when you unlock the free games in the Cold Spell online slot, so keep your fingers crossed in the hope of finding lots of magic wands on the reels.\n\nOur Cold Spell review team was left stunned by this epic release from Novomatic.\n\nThe stunning images bring a trio of characters to life when playing the Cold Spell slot machine. You will hope that the Fire Wizard honors you with his presence on a frequent basis with wins of up to 9,000x your bet line. The ability to substitute all symbols with the Wild is fantastic, but it's the free games feature that really ups the ante. The fact that all wins are tripled makes this feature incredibly exciting.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAfter playing Cold Spell for free, why not spin the reels of NetEnt's Magic Portal? Witches, warlocks, sorcerers, and wizards display their power over five reels and 25 paylines, creating wins of up to 64,000 coins. Trust us, you will never tire of the electric wins made possible by wild rotations and free spins.\n\nFor some fun with fairies and dragons, take a look at Amaya's Fantasy Realm slot. This five-reel, 25-payline slot boasts animations that are as impressive as its bonus features. A queen of the elves can knock her staff against the ground to trigger 25 free spins with all wins doubled. You can also win the Movie Mayhem Jackpot.\n            ",

It is played on 10 paylines, allowing players to get started with bets as low as 0.10 credits per spin. The game's high variance means players can expect plenty of volatility as they try to penetrate the icy realm and break the spell cast upon its lands.\n\nSymbols and paylines\n\nIn addition to the high-paying Fire Wizard, Cold Spell offers lower payouts for matching playing card symbols, tiaras, maps, and treasure chests. Wins are calculated on 10 paylines and players have the chance to hit a maximum payout of 9,000x their bet line.\n\nBonuses and features\n\nThe Fire Wizard serves as both the game's highest-paying symbol and the Wild. Represented by a magic wand, the Fire Wizard Scatter symbol triggers 15 free games whenever players land three or more on the reels. During free games, all wins are tripled and respins are possible, creating heart-pumping action for players.\n\nPayout percentage and variance\n\nThe Cold Spell slot game has a payout percentage of 95.05%. This low RTP is offset by the game's high variance, meaning that players may experience frequent losses but could win up to 9,000x their bet line.\n\nBetting options\n\nThe Cold Spell slot provides flexibility with its betting options. Players can wager as little as 0.01 credits per coin and select up to 10 coins per payline. This means they can enjoy the game's high volatility factor with just 0.10 credits per spin, while high rollers can bet up to 100 credits per spin.\n\nScatter and Wild symbols\n\nThe Fire Wizard symbol serves as both the game's Scatter and Wild. When landed, it substitutes for all symbols except other Scatter symbols. Landing three or more Scatter symbols triggers 15 free games. During these rounds, all wins are tripled.\n\nAvailability and software\n\nThe Cold Spell slot game is available at online casinos where Novomatic's software is offered. The game's fantasy and chilly graphics, along with its bonus features and high volatility, make it an exciting addition to the collection of slot games offered at casinos around the world.\n\n        \n            ",

Even if your fingers are numb from the cold, you won't have trouble spinning these ice-covered reels. Coin values range from 0.01 to 1, with a maximum of 10 coins that can be bet on each payline.

Not only does the Fire Wizard deliver wins of up to 9,000x your bet line as the game's highest paying symbol, but he also represents the Wild symbol. The bold and beautiful Fire Wizard can substitute for all symbols except the Scatters. More importantly, he doubles wins when substituting.\n\nHis magic wand represents the Scatter symbol. You will receive 5x, 20x, or 500x your bet every time you land three, four, or five Scatter symbols respectively. The Fire Wizard will also award 15 free games with all wins multiplied by 3x. Respins are possible when you unlock the free games in the Cold Spell online slot, so keep your fingers crossed in the hope of finding lots of magic wands on the reels.\n\nOur Cold Spell review team was left stunned by this epic release from Novomatic.\n\nThe stunning images bring a trio of characters to life when playing the Cold Spell slot machine. You will hope that the Fire Wizard honors you with his presence on a frequent basis with wins of up to 9,000x your bet line. The ability to substitute all symbols with the Wild is fantastic, but it's the free games feature that really ups the ante. The fact that all wins are tripled makes this feature incredibly exciting.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAfter playing Cold Spell for free, why not spin the reels of NetEnt's Magic Portal? Witches, warlocks, sorcerers, and wizards display their power over five reels and 25 paylines, creating wins of up to 64,000 coins.
