    "original_text": "\nCrazy Wizard\nA nostro parere, le slot a tema fantasy sono quelle in grado di offrire un coinvolgimento di livello superiore grazie a una grafica curata al dettaglio e un gameplay interessante. In Crazy Wizard, slot di casa Playtech, questi due elementi si fondono alla perfezione, regalando al giocatore un’esperienza di gioco avvincente e per nulla scontata. Il protagonista è un mago che grazie all’utilizzo di un libro di incantesimi, riesce a preparare pozioni che ci permetteranno di raddoppiare le nostre vincite.\nCome dicevamo, la grafica è di ottima fattura. La griglia ha una trama totalmente nera con delle fiamme sullo sfondo. Qualche effetto animato segue le vincite e l’attivazione della funzione Giri Gratuiti. Il comparto musicale è composto da una musica incalzante che però non distrae dal gioco, comunque è sempre possibile accedere al menù e disattivarla. Ai lati della cornice sono indicate le linee di pagamento, mentre in basso, divisi per settori, ci sono il saldo, le vincite, il valore del gettone e la puntata totale. Completano il tutto il tasto Start e quello Autoplay.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nIn Crazy Wizard abbiamo una griglia composta da 5 rulli e 3 righe su cui si snodano 10 linee di pagamento fisse. Si vince con almeno tre simboli identici adiacenti a partire da sinistra verso destra. Il valore del gettone varia da 0,01 € a un massimo di 2 €. Si punta un gettone su ogni linea, ciò vuol dire che la nostra puntata totale può variare da 0,10 € a 20 € in base alle nostre scelte. Naturalmente ci sono livelli intermedi di scommessa che ci permettono di decidere al meglio quanto pagare per ogni giro.\nPossiamo scegliere di impostare tra i 10 e 50 giri automatici, compresi alcuni limiti di vincita e di perdita. Nel caso venga assegnato un jackpot, i giri si interromperanno automaticamente.\nIl valore RTP del 96,56% è di tutto rispetto.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nCi sono 10 simboli totali, 6 di basso livello e 4 di alto livello, più 2 speciali. Le carte dal gioco dal 10 all’asso valgono meno di tutti. A salire troviamo l’ampolla, la candela, la sfera magica e il libro di incantesimi. Il mago è un simbolo Wild pagante. Ricoprendo la funzione di Jolly, va a sostituire tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter. Inoltre, in una linea pagante, raddoppia la vincita.\nIl drago è il nostro simbolo Scatter. Con 3 abbiamo diritto a 10 giri gratuiti, con 4 i giri saranno 20 e con 5 ne avremo a disposizione 30. In ogni giro gratuito, 2, 3 o 4 simboli regolari vengono sostituiti in modo casuale con simboli Jolly. I giri gratuiti possono essere riattivati durante il gioco bonus con le stesse modalità descritte sopra. Il tetto massimo di giri gratis guadagnati è di 250.\nGiudizio finale\nSe dovessimo dare un voto a Crazy Wizard, sarebbe di certo un 7 pieno. La grafica è la cosa che più ci è piaciuta insieme alla pulizia del software. Durante le nostre prove il sistema non si è mai impallato e l’esperienza di gioco è stata molto piacevole. Un aspetto su cui la Playtech avrebbe potuto insistere è il sistema di bonus, che ci è sembrato leggermente scarno. Questo non vuol dire che sia scadente, anzi, tutt’altro. Diciamo che Crazy Wizard si rivela un’ottima slot per chi cerca un sistema di gioco classico, meno indicato per chi invece vuole provare metodologie di gioco complessi.\n",

Crazy Wizard, a Playtech slot, combines these two elements perfectly, delivering a captivating and unpredictable gaming experience. The protagonist is a wizard who, thanks to a book of spells, prepares potions that allow us to double our winnings.\nAs we said, the graphics are of excellent quality. The grid has a completely black texture with flames in the background. Some animated effects follow the wins and activation of the Free Spins feature. The music component consists of driving music that does not distract from the game, however, it is always possible to access the menu and turn it off. The paylines are indicated on the sides of the frame, while at the bottom, divided into sectors, there are the balance, winnings, token value, and total bet. The Start and Autoplay buttons complete everything.\nSlot Features:\nIn Crazy Wizard, we have a grid consisting of 5 reels and 3 rows on which 10 fixed paylines run. We win with at least three identical symbols adjacent from left to right. Token value ranges from € 0.01 to a maximum of € 2. A token is bet on each line, which means that our total bet can range from € 0.10 to € 20 depending on our choices. Of course, there are intermediate levels of betting that allow us to decide how much to pay for each spin.\nWe can choose to set between 10 and 50 automatic spins, including some win and loss limits. In the event of a jackpot being awarded, the spins will automatically stop.\nThe respectable RTP value of 96.56%.\nSymbols and Features:\nThere are a total of 10 symbols, 6 low-level and 4 high-level, plus 2 special ones. The playing cards from 10 to ace are worth less than all of them. Rising up we find the ampoule, candle, magic sphere, and spellbook. The wizard is a paying Wild symbol. Covering the role of Jolly, it replaces all symbols except Scatter. Furthermore, in a paying line, it doubles the winnings.\nThe dragon is our Scatter symbol. With 3, we are entitled to 10 free spins, with 4 the spins will be 20 and with 5 we will have 30 available. In every free spin, 2, 3, or 4 regular symbols are randomly replaced with Jolly symbols. Free spins can be reactivated during the bonus game in the same way described above. The maximum number of free spins earned is 250.\nFinal Judgment:\nIf we had to rate Crazy Wizard, it would certainly be a full 7. The graphics are the thing we liked the most along with the cleanliness of the software. During our tests, the system never got stuck and the gaming experience was very enjoyable. One aspect that Playtech could have insisted on is the bonus system, which seemed slightly lacking to us. This does not mean that it is poor, on the contrary, quite the opposite. Let's say that Crazy Wizard proves to be an excellent slot for those looking for a classic gaming system, less suitable for those who instead want to try complex gaming methodologies.\n            ",

Crazy Wizard, a Playtech slot, combines these two elements perfectly, delivering a captivating and unpredictable gaming experience. The protagonist is a wizard who, thanks to a book of spells, prepares potions that allow us to double our winnings.\nAs we said, the graphics are of excellent quality. The grid has a completely black texture with flames in the background. Some animated effects follow the wins and activation of the Free Spins feature. The music component consists of driving music that does not distract from the game, however, it is always possible to access the menu and turn it off. The paylines are indicated on the sides of the frame, while at the bottom, divided into sectors, there are the balance, winnings, token value, and total bet. The Start and Autoplay buttons complete everything.\nSlot Features:\nIn Crazy Wizard, we have a grid consisting of 5 reels and 3 rows on which 10 fixed paylines run. We win with at least three identical symbols adjacent from left to right. Token value ranges from € 0.01 to a maximum of € 2. A token is bet on each line, which means that our total bet can range from € 0.10 to € 20 depending on our choices. Of course, there are intermediate levels of betting that allow us to decide how much to pay for each spin.\nWe can choose to set between 10 and 50 automatic spins, including some win and loss limits. In the event of a jackpot being awarded, the spins will automatically stop.\nThe respectable RTP value of 96.56%.\nSymbols and Features:\nThere are a total of 10 symbols, 6 low-level and 4 high-level, plus 2 special ones. The playing cards from 10 to ace are worth less than all of them. Rising up we find the ampoule, candle, magic sphere, and spellbook. The wizard is a paying Wild symbol. Covering the role of Jolly, it replaces all symbols except Scatter. Furthermore, in a paying line, it doubles the winnings.\nThe dragon is our Scatter symbol. With 3, we are entitled to 10 free spins, with 4 the spins will be 20 and with 5 we will have 30 available. In every free spin, 2, 3, or 4 regular symbols are randomly replaced with Jolly symbols. Free spins can be reactivated during the bonus game in the same way described above. The maximum number of free spins earned is 250.\nFinal Judgment:\nIf we had to rate Crazy Wizard, it would certainly be a full 7. The graphics are the thing we liked the most along with the cleanliness of the software. During our tests, the system never got stuck and the gaming experience was very enjoyable. One aspect that Playtech could have insisted on is the bonus system, which seemed slightly lacking to us. This does not mean that it is poor, on the contrary, quite the opposite. Let's say that Crazy Wizard proves to be an excellent slot for those looking for a classic gaming system, less suitable for those who instead want to try complex gaming methodologies.\n            ",

Crazy Wizard, a Playtech slot, combines these two elements perfectly, delivering a captivating and unpredictable gaming experience. The protagonist is a wizard who, thanks to a book of spells, prepares potions that allow us to double our winnings.\nAs we said, the graphics are of excellent quality. The grid has a completely black texture with flames in the background. Some animated effects follow the wins and activation of the Free Spins feature. The music component consists of driving music that does not distract from the game, however, it is always possible to access the menu and turn it off. The paylines are indicated on the sides of the frame, while at the bottom, divided into sectors, there are the balance, winnings, token value, and total bet. The Start and Autoplay buttons complete everything.\nSlot Features:\nIn Crazy Wizard, we have a grid consisting of 5 reels and 3 rows on which 10 fixed paylines run. We win with at least three identical symbols adjacent from left to right. Token value ranges from € 0.01 to a maximum of € 2. A token is bet on each line, which means that our total bet can range from € 0.10 to € 20 depending on our choices. Of course, there are intermediate levels of betting that allow us to decide how much to pay for each spin.\nWe can choose to set between 10 and 50 automatic spins, including some win and loss limits. In the event of a jackpot being awarded, the spins will automatically stop.\nThe respectable RTP value of 96.56%.\nSymbols and Features:\nThere are a total of 10 symbols, 6 low-level and 4 high-level, plus 2 special ones. The playing cards from 10 to ace are worth less than all of them. Rising up we find the ampoule, candle, magic sphere, and spellbook. The wizard is a paying Wild symbol. Covering the role of Jolly, it replaces all symbols except Scatter. Furthermore, in a paying line, it doubles the winnings.\nThe dragon is our Scatter symbol. With 3, we are entitled to 10 free spins, with 4 the spins will be 20 and with 5 we will have 30 available. In every free spin, 2, 3, or 4 regular symbols are randomly replaced with Jolly symbols. Free spins can be reactivated during the bonus game in the same way described above. The maximum number of free spins earned is 250.\nFinal Judgment:\nIf we had to rate Crazy Wizard, it would certainly be a full 7. The graphics are the thing we liked the most along with the cleanliness of the software. During our tests, the system never got stuck and the gaming experience was very enjoyable. One aspect that Playtech could have insisted on is the bonus system, which seemed slightly lacking to us. This does not mean that it is poor, on the contrary, quite the opposite. Let's say that Crazy Wizard proves to be an excellent slot for those looking for a classic gaming system, less suitable for those who instead want to try complex gaming methodologies.\n            ",
