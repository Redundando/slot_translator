The game has standard options like any other slot video game, such as the Auto Play button and the Max Bet option for riskier players. You can find all options below the reels, at the bottom of the screen. These are the option button, the Gamble bet, the Change Lines, the Spin button, the Auto Play, the Sound, and the Gamble Feature function. The Gamble option is great for all players who want to test their luck. After each win, you will have the chance to double the win by playing a game of your choice. However, keep in mind that if you make the wrong choice, you risk losing everything. So, think twice before activating the Gamble option.\n\nTo form a winning combination when spinning the reels of the Easter Island slot, you must land at least two or three matching symbols. The frequency of the symbol depends on its value. The symbol that pays the most is the rabbit that pulls out a rabbit. Landing five of this symbol will bring you a prize of 5000 coins. The next high-value symbol is the bunny in a boat. And if you manage to land five matching symbols, you will be rewarded with 100 coins.\n\nIf you want to find the value for the rest of the symbols, make sure you check Easter Island's paytable.\n\nThe Easter Island slot has only two bonus features, but they can certainly bring you many rewards if you know how to play them well. So, keep reading and find out all the details about the Prize Pick bonus feature and the Free Spins bonus round.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines:\nThe slot machine produced by Yggdrasil certainly brings back to the magnificent Easter period, a feast for the whole world. If you want to continue betting your money in such a joyous setting, we can also recommend playing Easter Eggs, the slot machine produced by Play 'N Go, where you can win multipliers up to 500x.\n            ",

And if you manage to land five matching symbols, you will be rewarded with 100 coins.\n\nIf you want to find the value for the rest of the symbols, make sure you check Easter Island's paytable.\n\nThe Easter Island slot has only two bonus features, but they can certainly bring you many rewards if you know how to play them well. So, keep reading and find out all the details about the Prize Pick bonus feature and the Free Spins bonus round.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines:\nThe slot machine produced by Yggdrasil certainly brings back to the magnificent Easter period, a feast for the whole world.
