Le puntate minime partono da 1,00€ fino ad un massimo di 20,00€, forse un po’ deludente per i giocatori Prof che amano poste più elevate.

Da tre e cinque Boomerang ti aggiudicherai 5 Giri Gratis\nLe icone Sunset, se appaiono almeno 6 volte sui rulli, ti offriranno un Bonus chiamato Spin and Hold. Solo i tre rulli centrali ottengono questi Scatter Sunset, almeno inizialmente. Essi offrono 3 Respins gratis con la trasformazione delle icone Sunset in Sticky.\n\nCome si ottiene il Grand Bonus?\nVuoi sapere come aggiudicarti il premio più grande del gioco il Grand Bonus? Hai due opzioni:\n\nHai bisogno che i rulli siano coperti dalle icone Sunset alla fine della funzione\nIl secondo modo per ottenere un Grand Bonus è casuale mentre giochi in modalità a pagamento.\n\nIl mio verdetto su Kanga Cash\nQuesta slot gratis mi è parsa un gioco piacevole, ideale per giocatori occasionali senza molte pretese ma forse, meno adatta agli utenti Prof!

Set in the wilds of the Australian outback, this free slot game offers a rare encounter with majestic kangaroos, wild dingoes, and lizards that inhabit this harsh and beautiful terrain. Read on for my review of Kanga Cash Extra and discover how you can reap random rewards up to 200 times your bet, plus free spins with bonus prizes!\n\nGameplay: Kanga Cash Extra without Download\nGet comfortable and try out the no-registration version of Kanga Cash. The minimum bets start at €1.00 and go up to a maximum of €20.00. This may disappoint some high rollers amongst us who prefer higher stakes, but fear not. Kanga Cash boasts a very generous RTP of approximately 96.13% and high volatility that can turn your bets around! The big rewards, including fantastic Jackpots, are hidden at the end of the Spin and Hold feature, which could award you the Grand Jackpot of €15,000.00!\n\nNaturalistic Symbolism and Extra Features\nThe reels of Kanga Cash Extra online slot are bursting with colorful symbols, featuring intricately decorated playing cards with traditional aboriginal artwork to match the game's overall style. This game offers convenient Autoplay standard controls, which spin the reels for you until you choose to take over. Be sure to pre-set win and loss limits to avoid the high volatility from eating away at your bankroll. Let's dive into the main symbols of this online slot:\n\nStandard playing cards that pay less\nAn eagle soaring above other symbols, providing rewards equal to 0.5 times your bet when it appears on the first two reels, and 30 times when it fills an entire payline.\nThe word WILD overlapping a map of Australia, acting as any card or animal symbol and can thus complete winning lines. However, it only appears on reels 3, 4, and 5.\nThe Kangaroo is the Scatter symbol and triggers the extra Spin and Hold feature when it appears in three or more positions simultaneously.\n\nWhat are Boomerang and Sunset symbols?\nBoomerang symbols are responsible for activating Free Spins. From three and five Boomerangs, you will be awarded 5 Free Spins.\nThe Sunset icons, if they appear at least six times on the reels, will offer you a bonus called Spin and Hold. Only the three central reels get these Sunset Scatters, at least initially. They give you 3 free Respins with Sunset icons transforming into Sticky.\n\nHow do I get the Grand Bonus?\nDo you want to know how to win the biggest prize in the game – The Grand Bonus? You have two options:\n\nCover the reels with Sunset icons at the end of the feature.\nOr, the second way to get a Grand Bonus is random during paid play.\n\nMy Verdict on Kanga Cash Extra\nTo conclude, this free slot game offers a pleasant experience and is perfect for casual players with little claim, but perhaps less suitable for experienced players. For a more exhilarating pace, I recommend trying out Ainsworth's other newest slot called Amazon Gold, available in our library in both demo and paid versions.\n            ",

Read on for my review of Kanga Cash Extra and discover how you can reap random rewards up to 200 times your bet, plus free spins with bonus prizes!\n\nGameplay: Kanga Cash Extra without Download\nGet comfortable and try out the no-registration version of Kanga Cash. The minimum bets start at €1.00 and go up to a maximum of €20.00. This may disappoint some high rollers amongst us who prefer higher stakes, but fear not. Kanga Cash boasts a very generous RTP of approximately 96.13% and high volatility that can turn your bets around! The big rewards, including fantastic Jackpots, are hidden at the end of the Spin and Hold feature, which could award you the Grand Jackpot of €15,000.00!\n\nNaturalistic Symbolism and Extra Features\nThe reels of Kanga Cash Extra online slot are bursting with colorful symbols, featuring intricately decorated playing cards with traditional aboriginal artwork to match the game's overall style. This game offers convenient Autoplay standard controls, which spin the reels for you until you choose to take over. Be sure to pre-set win and loss limits to avoid the high volatility from eating away at your bankroll. Let's dive into the main symbols of this online slot:\n\nStandard playing cards that pay less\nAn eagle soaring above other symbols, providing rewards equal to 0.5 times your bet when it appears on the first two reels, and 30 times when it fills an entire payline.\nThe word WILD overlapping a map of Australia, acting as any card or animal symbol and can thus complete winning lines. However, it only appears on reels 3, 4, and 5.\nThe Kangaroo is the Scatter symbol and triggers the extra Spin and Hold feature when it appears in three or more positions simultaneously.\n\nWhat are Boomerang and Sunset symbols?\nBoomerang symbols are responsible for activating Free Spins. From three and five Boomerangs, you will be awarded 5 Free Spins.\nThe Sunset icons, if they appear at least six times on the reels, will offer you a bonus called Spin and Hold. Only the three central reels get these Sunset Scatters, at least initially. They give you 3 free Respins with Sunset icons transforming into Sticky.\n\nHow do I get the Grand Bonus?\nDo you want to know how to win the biggest prize in the game – The Grand Bonus? You have two options:\n\nCover the reels with Sunset icons at the end of the feature.\nOr, the second way to get a Grand Bonus is random during paid play.\n\nMy Verdict on Kanga Cash Extra\nTo conclude, this free slot game offers a pleasant experience and is perfect for casual players with little claim, but perhaps less suitable for experienced players. For a more exhilarating pace, I recommend trying out Ainsworth's other newest slot called Amazon Gold, available in our library in both demo and paid versions.\n        ",
