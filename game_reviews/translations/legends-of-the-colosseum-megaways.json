The shows were characterized mainly by fights between gladiators and between gladiators and ferocious animals, such as tigers and lions, but epic battles or mythological tales were often reproduced.\n\nWith Legends of the Colosseum Megaways we fully immerse into the atmosphere of the great games and we do it through stunning graphics that change according to the type of game. In the base game, we find ourselves outside the amphitheater, while during Free Spins we move to the arena. In the lower part of the screen, there are all the buttons to set our game best while in the upper left corner we find the Megaways counter that shows us our winning possibilities at any time. There is also a button that allows us to buy free spins.\n\nFeatures of Legends of the Colosseum Megaways\n\nAs already mentioned, the slot is part of the Megaways circuit, which means that the ways to win change based on the variable number of symbols collected by the six reels. It ranges from a minimum of 2 up to a maximum of 6. The minimum bet is €0.10 and the maximum win is 10,000 times the bet. You win by matching at least 3 symbols on a payline, although for gladiators, 2 are enough. The game system is cascade, which means that every time a paying combination is formed, the winning symbols are removed and replaced by completely new ones.\n\nAbove the grid, there is a horizontal roller that scrolls and contributes to forming winning series.\n\nAmong the features, there are Autoplay and Gamble, which allows you to double or lose the amount won.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player is 96%.\n\nHow to play Legends of the Colosseum Megaways\n\nIn this slot, we find low-level symbols represented by the royals from 9 to Ace, and thematic symbols such as the horse, the tiger, the woman, and the gladiator. Crossed swords are our Wild, and substitute for all symbols except the Scatter and the gold coin. Also, if it appears 6 times, it pays 50x the bet. The question mark is the mystery symbol that will randomly be transformed into another symbol.\n\nThe Colosseum is the Scatter, if four of them land, we will be assigned Free Spins. But first, we will see three wheels divided into sectors. The first for the number of free spins, at least 4, up to 14; the second for the multiplier, ranging from x2 to x25; the third wheel indicates the level of the game.\n\nDuring Free Spins, gold coins may appear on the horizontal roller. Three of them are required to upgrade the level 1 and assign another 2 Free Spins. \n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: What is the minimum bet in Legends of the Colosseum Megaways?\nA: The minimum bet is €0.10.\n\nQ: What is the maximum win in Legends of the Colosseum Megaways?\nA: The maximum win is 10,000 times the bet.\n\nQ: What is the theoretical return to the player of Legends of the Colosseum Megaways?\nA: The theoretical return to the player is 96%.\n\nQ: What are the features of Legends of the Colosseum Megaways?\nA: The features of Legends of the Colosseum Megaways include Autoplay and Gamble, cascade system, and Megaways circuit.\n\nQ: What is the Scatter in Legends of the Colosseum Megaways?\nA: The Scatter in Legends of the Colosseum Megaways is the Colosseum.\n            ",

Legends of the Colosseum Megaways has several bonus features that make the game more exciting than a chariot race. For starters, the game utilizes the Megaways circuitry, which means that the number of ways to win alters according to the symbols on the six reels. The best part? Every spin could result in a new chance to win, keeping the game unpredictable and fun!</p> \n\n  <p>The Wild symbol in this game is crossed swords which, let's be honest, is way cooler than Batman's batarang. The Wild symbol replaces all the other symbols, except the Scatter and the gold coin, helping increase your chance of winning. Pro tip: always keep your eyes peeled for those crossed swords. They could be your secret weapon in this game.</p>\n\n  <p>The Scatter symbol is the Colosseum, which is pretty fitting, given the game name. If you happen to land four of these bad boys, you'll be enjoying some Free Spins, my friend. Just imagine yourself as a Gladiator, taking on the vicious beasts in the arena, and getting rewarded along the way! </p>\n\n  <p>The creators of this game also added a mystery symbol that keeps things as unpredictable as a lion's moods on a hunger strike. Keep an eagle eye out for this one, as it transforms into another symbol at random. During Free Spins, players can collect gold coins on the horizontal roller, and when three are gathered, this opens up a higher rank in the game and more Free Spins. Pretty sweet, right?</p>"

They could be your secret weapon in this game.</p>\n\n  <p>The Scatter symbol is the Colosseum, which is pretty fitting, given the game name. If you happen to land four of these bad boys, you'll be enjoying some Free Spins, my friend. Just imagine yourself as a Gladiator, taking on the vicious beasts in the arena, and getting rewarded along the way! </p>\n\n  <p>The creators of this game also added a mystery symbol that keeps things as unpredictable as a lion's moods on a hunger strike. Keep an eagle eye out for this one, as it transforms into another symbol at random. During Free Spins, players can collect gold coins on the horizontal roller, and when three are gathered, this opens up a higher rank in the game and more Free Spins. Pretty sweet, right?</p>\"\n}"

The slot is part of the Megaways circuit, which means that the ways to win change based on the variable number of symbols collected. It ranges from a minimum of 2 up to a maximum of 6. The game system is cascade, which means that every time a paying combination is formed, the winning symbols are removed and replaced by completely new ones. Above the grid, there is a horizontal roller that scrolls and contributes to forming winning series. Among the features, there are Autoplay and Gamble, which allows you to double or lose the amount won. The theoretical return to the player is 96%.\n\nVisuals and atmosphere\n\nLegends of the Colosseum Megaways fully captures the atmosphere of ancient Rome through stunning graphics that change depending on the type of game. In the base game, players find themselves outside the amphitheater, while during Free Spins, they get to move to the arena. The lower part of the screen features all the buttons to set the game best, while the upper left corner shows the Megaways counter that displays winning possibilities. There is also a button that allows players to buy free spins.\n\nSymbol themes and values\n\nIn Legends of the Colosseum Megaways, players will encounter thematic symbols such as the horse, the tiger, the woman, and the gladiator. Crossed swords are the Wild symbol, and substitute for all symbols except the Scatter and the gold coin. Also, if it appears 6 times, it pays 50x the bet. The question mark is the mystery symbol that will randomly be transformed into another symbol. In addition, low-level symbols are represented by the royals from 9 to Ace.\n\nWinning opportunities and RTP\n\nPlayers can win by matching at least 3 symbols on a payline, although for gladiators, 2 are enough. The maximum win is 10,000 times the bet, and the theoretical return to the player is 96%.\n\nBonus features and free spins\n\nThe Colosseum is the Scatter, and if four of them land, players will be assigned Free Spins. Three wheels will spin, with the first indicating the number of free spins (at least 4, up to 14), the second for the multiplier (ranging from x2 to x25), and the third for the level of the game. During Free Spins, gold coins may appear on the horizontal roller. Three of them are required to upgrade the level 1 and assign another 2 Free Spins.\n\n        \n            ",

The shows were characterized mainly by fights between gladiators and between gladiators and ferocious animals, such as tigers and lions, but epic battles or mythological tales were often reproduced.\n\nWith Legends of the Colosseum Megaways we fully immerse into the atmosphere of the great games and we do it through stunning graphics that change according to the type of game. In the base game, we find ourselves outside the amphitheater, while during Free Spins we move to the arena. In the lower part of the screen, there are all the buttons to set our game best while in the upper left corner we find the Megaways counter that shows us our winning possibilities at any time. There is also a button that allows us to buy free spins.\n\nFeatures of Legends of the Colosseum Megaways\n\nAs already mentioned, the slot is part of the Megaways circuit, which means that the ways to win change based on the variable number of symbols collected by the six reels. It ranges from a minimum of 2 up to a maximum of 6. The minimum bet is €0.10 and the maximum win is 10,000 times the bet. You win by matching at least 3 symbols on a payline, although for gladiators, 2 are enough.
