Tra le sue caratteristiche troviamo i giri gratuiti e i simboli in espansione, pronti a farti provare avventure emozionanti!\nCaratteristiche del gioco e grafica\nLa prima cosa che ci sorprende sono le bellissime immagini grafiche che dominano lo sfondo su cui si posa la griglia con i rulli. Abbiamo un’antica porta un tempio azteco immerso nella giungla. Sulla zona destra troviamo un personaggio animato vicino ai rulli, che si muove seguendo la musica simpatica che scandisce i giri. Il giocatore ottiene delle vincite trovando tre o più icone simili: le carte da gioco hanno il valore più basso mentre le icone che pagano di più sono quelle legate al tema della slot. La maschera piumata e quella verde pagano da 5 a 750 volte il valore della scommessa. Mentre quella blu ti aiuta a ottenere da 10 a 5.000 volte il valore della puntata. E il Wild?

When players come across three or more of these symbols, the Aztec Sun gets activated and replaces the basic symbols to create even more winning combinations. Now that's what we call a worthy sidekick.</p><p>But wait, there's more! The bonus feature in Aztec Warrior offers free spins to players that can unlock when they find three or more Aztec Sun symbols.

With options of 8, 10, and 12 free spins, players can definitely increase their chances of winning. We definitely wouldn't mind a few more of those free spins ourselves!</p><p>And the cherry on top of this already delectable cake?
