With its spectacular graphics, rich in detail, the game immerses you in its theme right away. The grid is set in the center of a typical Western town, with dusty streets, a cactus, a wooden barrel with a pair of handcuffs, and a saloon. Every spin is accompanied by an epic tune that closely resembles Ennio Morricone's pieces for cinema masterpieces like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\n\nAn Outlaw RTP\n\nPush Gaming opted for a traditional 5-reel and 3-row grid, on which we find our 20 fixed pay lines. The cost of each spin ranges from € 0.10 to € 100, with an excellent cost range. You win by creating combos of identical symbols starting from the rightmost reel and proceeding leftward. Deadly 5's volatility is medium, meaning there is an excellent balance between the number of spins performed and the amounts won. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is astonishing, standing at 96.39%.\n\nA Bounty for Every Criminal\n\nDeadly 5's symbols can be divided into two significant groups: low-level and high-level. The first group includes a horseshoe, boots, a whiskey flask, and a Colt, while in the second group, we find the four outlaws.\n\nThe sheriff's badge is our Wild, which replaces all symbols except the Scatter, and it's also the most valuable symbol, paying up to 250x the bet.\n\nThe safe is the Scatter, and with 3, 4, or 5 symbols you're entitled to Free Spins:\n\n3 Scatter assigns 10 free spins and multiplies the bet by 3\n4 Scatter assigns 15 free spins and multiplies the bet by 10\n5 Scatter assigns 20 free spins and multiplies the bet by 50\n\nIn the Bonus feature, we see an extended Wild appear on the grid, and above each reel is a poster of one of the outlaws. If a bandit symbol falls under their poster, it will transform into an extended Wild.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Deadly 5's RTP really that good?\n\nWith a theoretical return to player of 96.39%, Deadly 5's RTP is higher than the average of most slot games, which typically reaches 95%.\n\nCan I only play on PC?\n\nNo, Deadly 5 is also available for smartphones and tablets.\n\nAre there automatic spins?\n\nNo, this function is not present.",

This game is sure to captivate the hearts of Western genre fans with its spectacular graphics and attention to detail. The layout is set in the center of a typical Western village with dusty streets, a cactus, a wooden barrel with handcuffs attached, and a saloon. Each spin is accompanied by an epic melody that closely resembles Ennio Morricone's masterpiece works, such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. \n\nAn Outlaw RTP \nPush Gaming has opted for a traditional 5-reel and 3-row layout, with 20 fixed pay lines. The cost of each spin has a great range, with a minimum bet of €0.10 and a maximum bet of €100. Winning combos are created by matching identical symbols from the rightmost reel and continuing to the left. Deadly 5 has a medium volatility, which means that there is a perfect balance between the number of rounds played and the amounts won. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is extremely impressive, standing at 96.39%.\n\nA Bounty for Every Criminal \nThe Deadly 5 symbols can be divided into two large groups: low-value and high-value. The low-value symbols are the horseshoe, boots, whiskey flask, and colt revolver. In contrast, the four outlaws belong to the high-value group. The sheriff's badge is the wild symbol, which can substitute for all other symbols except for the scatter. Most importantly, it is the highest paying symbol and can pay up to 250x the wager. The safe is the scatter, and with 3, 4 or 5 symbols, players can enjoy free spins:\n\n3 Scatters give 10 free spins and multiply the bet by 3. \n4 Scatters give 15 free spins and multiply the bet by 10. \n5 Scatters give 20 free spins and multiply the bet by 50. \n\nDuring the Bonus feature, an extended wild will appear on the grid, and above each reel, a poster of one of the outlaws will appear. If the symbol of the bandit falls beneath his poster, it will transform into an extended wild.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions \nIs the RTP value of Deadly 5 really that good? \n\nThe theoretical return to player of 96.39% is above-average compared to most slot games, which typically range around 95%. \n\nCan I play only on PC? \n\nNo, Deadly 5 is also available on smartphones and tablets. \n\nAre automatic spins available? \n\nNo, this function is not present. \n\nTake on the Wild West with Deadly 5 and see if you can conquer the outlaws and win big!\n            ",
