Then there are Huginn and Muninn, Odin's two messenger ravens.\nAs you can imagine, the graphics are the strong point of this slot machine, faithfully reproducing Asgard, the home of the Aesir, the lords of heaven.\nThe soundtrack is compelling and epic, immersing us even more in splendid Nordic atmospheres.\nA special grid\n\nIn Gods of Asgard Megaways, the grid has 6 reels but a variable number of rows, from 2 to 7, and a horizontal roller placed on the top that contributes to creating winning combos. The ways of winning range from 324 to 200,704, as indicated in the counter on each spin.\nThe minimum bet is €0.10, but it can be raised at will. Autoplay allows us to set a variable number of automatic spins and to choose some limits beyond which this mode will be interrupted.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is of an absolute level, equal to 96.7%, while the volatility is high.\nThe deities that help you win\n\nBefore delving into the various and multiple bonuses, let's take a look at the symbols. To win, you need to associate 3 to 6 identical symbols and every time you get a paying combo, the symbols that generated it are replaced with completely new ones. The cards from ten to ace have the lowest value, while the horn, cup, medallion, hammer, and ring pay better.\nWe have two Wild symbols: the Wolf substitutes all symbols except for the special ones. The Ravens do the same, but they multiply winnings by 2.\nThe lightning bolt is our Scatter and entitles us to a number of free games ranging from 8 to 20.\nNow let's see what happens when the deities appear:\n\nFreya: transforms from 2 to 4 symbols into Wild ones\nLoki: transforms from 2 to 4 symbols into a random symbol\nThor: transforms 3 or 4 symbols into the highest symbol.\nOdin: transforms 2 symbols into multiplier Wilds. In the free spins, every time the lion appears, the multiplier increases.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nWhere can I play Gods of Asgard Megaways?\n\nIn any online casino, keeping in mind that the only legal ones are those with the AAMS seal.\n\nI saw that Gods of Asgard Megaways has an RTP of 96.7%. Is this a good thing?\n\nYes, it is. Considering that it's a number that applies to a large number of games, the higher this value is, the greater the chance of taking home significant amounts.\n\nI'm not home, but I still want to play Gods of Asgard Megaways.

I guess we could say that Freya is the real MVP of this slot game!  Our mischievous friend, Loki, transforms from 2 to 4 symbols into a random symbol. We never know what we're going to get with Loki, but let's hope it's something good! Thor brings the power of lightning and thunder as he transforms 3 or 4 symbols into the highest symbol. Can we get a round of applause for Thor, please?</p> \n\n  <p>Of course, the king of the gods, Odin, won't be left behind; he transforms 2 symbols into multiplier Wilds. Keep an eye out for Odin; he might just make or break your game. And in the free spins round, the multiplier increases every time the lion symbol appears. That's right; we said lion symbol, not lion king. With all these symbols and bonus features, this game will keep you entertained for hours. Who said divine providence can't be fun?</p>\"\n}"

Just think of Marvel's Thor, Loki and Odin, to name the most famous.\nIn Gods of Asgard Megaways, we find these characters, with the addition of Freya, the goddess of fertility, and Fenrir, the mythological wolf, son of Loki. Then there are Huginn and Muninn, Odin's two messenger ravens.\nAs you can imagine, the graphics are the strong point of this slot machine, faithfully reproducing Asgard, the home of the Aesir, the lords of heaven.\nThe soundtrack is compelling and epic, immersing us even more in splendid Nordic atmospheres.\nA special grid\n\nIn Gods of Asgard Megaways, the grid has 6 reels but a variable number of rows, from 2 to 7, and a horizontal roller placed on the top that contributes to creating winning combos. The ways of winning range from 324 to 200,704, as indicated in the counter on each spin.\nThe minimum bet is €0.10, but it can be raised at will. Autoplay allows us to set a variable number of automatic spins and to choose some limits beyond which this mode will be interrupted.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is of an absolute level, equal to 96.7%, while the volatility is high.\nThe deities that help you win\n\nBefore delving into the various and multiple bonuses, let's take a look at the symbols. To win, you need to associate 3 to 6 identical symbols and every time you get a paying combo, the symbols that generated it are replaced with completely new ones. The cards from ten to ace have the lowest value, while the horn, cup, medallion, hammer, and ring pay better.\nWe have two Wild symbols: the Wolf substitutes all symbols except for the special ones. The Ravens do the same, but they multiply winnings by 2.\nThe lightning bolt is our Scatter and entitles us to a number of free games ranging from 8 to 20.\nNow let's see what happens when the deities appear:\n\nFreya: transforms from 2 to 4 symbols into Wild ones\nLoki: transforms from 2 to 4 symbols into a random symbol\nThor: transforms 3 or 4 symbols into the highest symbol.\nOdin: transforms 2 symbols into multiplier Wilds. In the free spins, every time the lion appears, the multiplier increases.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nWhere can I play Gods of Asgard Megaways?\n\nIn any online casino, keeping in mind that the only legal ones are those with the AAMS seal.\n\nI saw that Gods of Asgard Megaways has an RTP of 96.7%. Is this a good thing?\n\nYes, it is. Considering that it's a number that applies to a large number of games, the higher this value is, the greater the chance of taking home significant amounts.\n\nI'm not home, but I still want to play Gods of Asgard Megaways. Can I do it on my mobile phone?\n\nYes, Gods of Asgard Megaways has an architecture that allows you to play on all devices, including smartphones and tablets.\n            ",

Just think of Marvel's Thor, Loki and Odin, to name the most famous.\nIn Gods of Asgard Megaways, we find these characters, with the addition of Freya, the goddess of fertility, and Fenrir, the mythological wolf, son of Loki. Then there are Huginn and Muninn, Odin's two messenger ravens.\nAs you can imagine, the graphics are the strong point of this slot machine, faithfully reproducing Asgard, the home of the Aesir, the lords of heaven.\nThe soundtrack is compelling and epic, immersing us even more in splendid Nordic atmospheres.\nA special grid\n\nIn Gods of Asgard Megaways, the grid has 6 reels but a variable number of rows, from 2 to 7, and a horizontal roller placed on the top that contributes to creating winning combos. The ways of winning range from 324 to 200,704, as indicated in the counter on each spin.\nThe minimum bet is €0.10, but it can be raised at will. Autoplay allows us to set a variable number of automatic spins and to choose some limits beyond which this mode will be interrupted.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is of an absolute level, equal to 96.7%, while the volatility is high.\nThe deities that help you win\n\nBefore delving into the various and multiple bonuses, let's take a look at the symbols. To win, you need to associate 3 to 6 identical symbols and every time you get a paying combo, the symbols that generated it are replaced with completely new ones. The cards from ten to ace have the lowest value, while the horn, cup, medallion, hammer, and ring pay better.\nWe have two Wild symbols: the Wolf substitutes all symbols except for the special ones. The Ravens do the same, but they multiply winnings by 2.\nThe lightning bolt is our Scatter and entitles us to a number of free games ranging from 8 to 20.\nNow let's see what happens when the deities appear:\n\nFreya: transforms from 2 to 4 symbols into Wild ones\nLoki: transforms from 2 to 4 symbols into a random symbol\nThor: transforms 3 or 4 symbols into the highest symbol.\nOdin: transforms 2 symbols into multiplier Wilds. In the free spins, every time the lion appears, the multiplier increases.\n\nFAQ: Answers to the most frequently asked questions\n\nWhere can I play Gods of Asgard Megaways?\n\nIn any online casino, keeping in mind that the only legal ones are those with the AAMS seal.\n\nI saw that Gods of Asgard Megaways has an RTP of 96.7%. Is this a good thing?\n\nYes, it is. Considering that it's a number that applies to a large number of games, the higher this value is, the greater the chance of taking home significant amounts.\n\nI'm not home, but I still want to play Gods of Asgard Megaways. Can I do it on my mobile phone?\n\nYes, Gods of Asgard Megaways has an architecture that allows you to play on all devices, including smartphones and tablets.\n            ",
