The game features 5 reels and 1,024 ways to win, meaning that low-level players can enjoy frequent wins while relaxing in a tropical paradise on a Pacific island. But don't get too comfortable, because things will heat up a bit with some volcanic bonus features, including free spins and extra wilds with double wins. Will you awaken the Blazing Goddess from her slumber? You can play on all devices starting at €0.50 per spin. Look for the Blazing Goddess wild that doubles wins when part of a winning combination. Plus, in a unique feature to free games, start with up to 30 free spins and win another 30 free spins. With 1,024 ways to win, free spins and double free spins, the Blazing Goddess is sure to provide plenty of spinning entertainment to players looking for the most winning action for their wager. Because even though you won't exactly have uninterrupted peace and relaxation in the tropical paradise of this Lightning Box slot machine, rarely does a spin pass without a win.\n\nExciting Graphics\n\nThis Lightning Box slot machine is located on a tranquil Polynesian island somewhere in the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean. Around the reels, there are palm trees, sand, sea and some wonderful tribal tikis statues, while the reels themselves are adorned with tropical imagery. There are beautiful bright flowers, toucans, a furnace carved with features of Easter Island, and a native holding flames in the palm of their hand. You know, the usual things you find at a seaside resort...\n\nIn fact, players will notice a lot of strange events as they begin to spin the reels. In particular, the Blazing Goddess symbol appears from time to time, helping to create winning combinations by replacing other game symbols and doubling the value of the wins it completes. In fact, its wild icon has so much strength and power that it will momentarily ignite the reels with fire as the eyes of the goddess turn into a blinding white light. It's certainly spectacular, but you might start to get the feeling that this won't be such a peaceful tropical retreat after all!\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nPlayers will find it hard to catch a break once they realize that there is a boiling and smoking volcano on the island. This volcano serves as the game's scatter symbol, and when three or more land on the reels in any position, things will start to heat up a bit at the expense of comfort. This is because it will trigger a bonus spin, awakening the Blazing Goddess from her sleep inside the volcano. Now, we don't know her, but generally waking up someone who is sleeping is never a good idea, let alone a fiery madwoman with the power of gods and skies at her command. We mean, it's just asking for trouble. And, as such, the Blazing Goddess doesn't seem very happy about being disturbed when she starts hurling fiery rocks towards the second, third, and fourth reel of the slot machine. Although we advise you to take cover during this episode of rage, it's not that bad. This is because it will start 6 free spins while all those burning fireballs cling to the reels and act as extra wilds, increasing the chances of players getting hot wins.\n\nThis slot machine has 1,024 ways to win, which essentially means there are no particular pay lines to worry about. Instead, players can find winning prizes whenever matching symbols appear on adjacent reels on the 5x4 grid, starting from the leftmost reel that moves to the right. Available lines range from 0.01 to 5.00 credits, with the selected value multiplied by 50 times to calculate the total bet. Once players have set their bets, they can press the spin button that appears in the bottom right corner of the screen and watch in the hope that those symbols match. Or alternatively, players can press the autoplay button to set continuous spin action. Despite its name, Blazing Goddess may not be a real bolt from the blue - its quality design and discreet range of features make it still very playable. And if the goddess of fire works her magic, there are some potential wins.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nBlazing Goddess is based on a very strong female figure, whom players must oppose with all their efforts if they want to win fantastic prizes. Similar to this theme is Fire Queen, a slot produced by WMS with 11 reels and 100 pay lines. It is based on the Fire Queen, a queen responsible for protecting the treasures of her land and who will do anything to protect them and keep them out of your clutches.",

With 5 reels and 1,024 ways to win, even low-level players can enjoy frequent victories while relaxing in a tropical paradise on a Pacific island. But don't get too comfortable because things will heat up with some volcanic bonus features, including free spins and extra wilds that double your winnings. Are you brave enough to awaken the Blazing Goddess from her slumber? You can play on all devices starting from €0.50 per spin and look for the Blazing Goddess wild that doubles your winnings when included in a winning combination. Furthermore, with up to 30 free spins to start and another 30 to win, along with 1,024 ways to win a prize and double free spins, the Blazing Goddess is sure to provide plenty of spinning entertainment to experienced gamblers looking for the most winning action for their bets. While you may not exactly find peace and uninterrupted relaxation in this Lightning Box slot machine's tropical paradise, there are rarely any spins that don't result in a win.\n\nExciting Graphics\nThis Lightning Box slot machine is set on a tranquil Polynesian island somewhere in the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean. Around the reels are palm trees, sand, sea, and some fantastic tribal tiki statues, while the reels themselves are adorned with images of tropical nature. There are bright and beautiful flowers, toucans, a furnace carved with features of the Easter Island's face, and a native holding flames in the palm of their hand. It's the usual kind of things you'd find in a seaside resort...\n\nIn fact, as you start spinning the reels, you'll notice a lot of strange events taking place. In particular, the Blazing Goddess symbol appears from time to time, contributing to creating winning combinations by replacing other gameplay symbols and doubling the value of completed wins. In fact, her wild icon has so much strength and power that it momentarily sets the reels ablaze with fire as the Blazing Goddess's eyes transform into a blinding white light. It's certainly spectacular, but you may begin to sense that this won't be such a peaceful tropical retreat after all!\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nPlayers will find it tough to catch a break once they realize there's a boiling, smoking volcano on the island. This volcano serves as the game's scatter symbol, and when three or more appear on the reels in any position, things begin to heat up a bit too uncomfortably. This is because it triggers a bonus spin, awakening the Blazing Goddess from her slumber deep inside the volcano. Now, we don't know her personally, but generally speaking, abruptly waking someone up is never a good idea, let alone a fiery, crazy woman with the power of the gods and the skies at her command. We mean, that's just asking for trouble. And, as such, the Blazing Goddess doesn't seem too pleased to be disturbed as she starts hurling fiery rocks at the second, third, and fourth reels of the slot machine. Although we advise you to take cover during this eruption of rage, it's not all that bad. This is because it triggers 6 free spins as all those blazing fireballs attach themselves to the reels and act as extra wilds, increasing players' chances of earning hot wins.\n\nThis slot machine features 1,024 ways to win, meaning there aren't any particular paylines to worry about. Instead, players can find winning prizes whenever matching symbols appear on adjacent reels on the 5x4 grid, going from the leftmost reel that moves to the right. Available lines range from 0.01 to 5.00 credits, with the selected value multiplied 50 times to calculate the total bet. Once players have set their bets, they can press the spin button that appears in the bottom right corner of the screen and watch as those matching symbols fall into place. Alternatively, players can press the autospin button to set up continuous rotation action. Despite its name, Blazing Goddess may not be a true bolt from the blue. Its high-quality design and discreet range of features still make it very playable. And if the goddess of fire works her magic, there are some potentially big wins in store. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nThe Blazing Goddess slot machine is based on a very strong female figure that experienced gamblers must harness in order to win fantastic prizes. With a similar theme, there is also Fire Queen, a slot produced by WMS, with 11 reels and 100 paylines. It's based on the Fire Queen, a queen responsible for protecting the treasures of her land and therefore willing to do anything to keep them safe from your clutches."

With 5 reels and 1,024 ways to win, even low-level players can enjoy frequent victories while relaxing in a tropical paradise on a Pacific island. But don't get too comfortable because things will heat up with some volcanic bonus features, including free spins and extra wilds that double your winnings. Are you brave enough to awaken the Blazing Goddess from her slumber? You can play on all devices starting from €0.50 per spin and look for the Blazing Goddess wild that doubles your winnings when included in a winning combination. Furthermore, with up to 30 free spins to start and another 30 to win, along with 1,024 ways to win a prize and double free spins, the Blazing Goddess is sure to provide plenty of spinning entertainment to experienced gamblers looking for the most winning action for their bets. While you may not exactly find peace and uninterrupted relaxation in this Lightning Box slot machine's tropical paradise, there are rarely any spins that don't result in a win.\n\nExciting Graphics\nThis Lightning Box slot machine is set on a tranquil Polynesian island somewhere in the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean. Around the reels are palm trees, sand, sea, and some fantastic tribal tiki statues, while the reels themselves are adorned with images of tropical nature. There are bright and beautiful flowers, toucans, a furnace carved with features of the Easter Island's face, and a native holding flames in the palm of their hand. It's the usual kind of things you'd find in a seaside resort...\n\nIn fact, as you start spinning the reels, you'll notice a lot of strange events taking place. In particular, the Blazing Goddess symbol appears from time to time, contributing to creating winning combinations by replacing other gameplay symbols and doubling the value of completed wins. In fact, her wild icon has so much strength and power that it momentarily sets the reels ablaze with fire as the Blazing Goddess's eyes transform into a blinding white light. It's certainly spectacular, but you may begin to sense that this won't be such a peaceful tropical retreat after all!\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nPlayers will find it tough to catch a break once they realize there's a boiling, smoking volcano on the island. This volcano serves as the game's scatter symbol, and when three or more appear on the reels in any position, things begin to heat up a bit too uncomfortably. This is because it triggers a bonus spin, awakening the Blazing Goddess from her slumber deep inside the volcano. Now, we don't know her personally, but generally speaking, abruptly waking someone up is never a good idea, let alone a fiery, crazy woman with the power of the gods and the skies at her command. We mean, that's just asking for trouble. And, as such, the Blazing Goddess doesn't seem too pleased to be disturbed as she starts hurling fiery rocks at the second, third, and fourth reels of the slot machine. Although we advise you to take cover during this eruption of rage, it's not all that bad. This is because it triggers 6 free spins as all those blazing fireballs attach themselves to the reels and act as extra wilds, increasing players' chances of earning hot wins.\n\nThis slot machine features 1,024 ways to win, meaning there aren't any particular paylines to worry about. Instead, players can find winning prizes whenever matching symbols appear on adjacent reels on the 5x4 grid, going from the leftmost reel that moves to the right. Available lines range from 0.01 to 5.00 credits, with the selected value multiplied 50 times to calculate the total bet. Once players have set their bets, they can press the spin button that appears in the bottom right corner of the screen and watch as those matching symbols fall into place. Alternatively, players can press the autospin button to set up continuous rotation action. Despite its name, Blazing Goddess may not be a true bolt from the blue. Its high-quality design and discreet range of features still make it very playable. And if the goddess of fire works her magic, there are some potentially big wins in store. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nThe Blazing Goddess slot machine is based on a very strong female figure that experienced gamblers must harness in order to win fantastic prizes. With a similar theme, there is also Fire Queen, a slot produced by WMS, with 11 reels and 100 paylines. It's based on the Fire Queen, a queen responsible for protecting the treasures of her land and therefore willing to do anything to keep them safe from your clutches.\n            ",

With 5 reels and 1,024 ways to win, even low-level players can enjoy frequent victories while relaxing in a tropical paradise on a Pacific island. But don't get too comfortable because things will heat up with some volcanic bonus features, including free spins and extra wilds that double your winnings. Are you brave enough to awaken the Blazing Goddess from her slumber? You can play on all devices starting from €0.50 per spin and look for the Blazing Goddess wild that doubles your winnings when included in a winning combination. Furthermore, with up to 30 free spins to start and another 30 to win, along with 1,024 ways to win a prize and double free spins, the Blazing Goddess is sure to provide plenty of spinning entertainment to experienced gamblers looking for the most winning action for their bets. While you may not exactly find peace and uninterrupted relaxation in this Lightning Box slot machine's tropical paradise, there are rarely any spins that don't result in a win.\n\nExciting Graphics\nThis Lightning Box slot machine is set on a tranquil Polynesian island somewhere in the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean. Around the reels are palm trees, sand, sea, and some fantastic tribal tiki statues, while the reels themselves are adorned with images of tropical nature. There are bright and beautiful flowers, toucans, a furnace carved with features of the Easter Island's face, and a native holding flames in the palm of their hand. It's the usual kind of things you'd find in a seaside resort...\n\nIn fact, as you start spinning the reels, you'll notice a lot of strange events taking place. In particular, the Blazing Goddess symbol appears from time to time, contributing to creating winning combinations by replacing other gameplay symbols and doubling the value of completed wins. In fact, her wild icon has so much strength and power that it momentarily sets the reels ablaze with fire as the Blazing Goddess's eyes transform into a blinding white light. It's certainly spectacular, but you may begin to sense that this won't be such a peaceful tropical retreat after all!\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nPlayers will find it tough to catch a break once they realize there's a boiling, smoking volcano on the island. This volcano serves as the game's scatter symbol, and when three or more appear on the reels in any position, things begin to heat up a bit too uncomfortably. This is because it triggers a bonus spin, awakening the Blazing Goddess from her slumber deep inside the volcano. Now, we don't know her personally, but generally speaking, abruptly waking someone up is never a good idea, let alone a fiery, crazy woman with the power of the gods and the skies at her command.

With 5 reels and 1,024 ways to win, even low-level players can enjoy frequent victories while relaxing in a tropical paradise on a Pacific island. But don't get too comfortable because things will heat up with some volcanic bonus features, including free spins and extra wilds that double your winnings. Are you brave enough to awaken the Blazing Goddess from her slumber? You can play on all devices starting from €0.50 per spin and look for the Blazing Goddess wild that doubles your winnings when included in a winning combination. Furthermore, with up to 30 free spins to start and another 30 to win, along with 1,024 ways to win a prize and double free spins, the Blazing Goddess is sure to provide plenty of spinning entertainment to experienced gamblers looking for the most winning action for their bets. While you may not exactly find peace and uninterrupted relaxation in this Lightning Box slot machine's tropical paradise, there are rarely any spins that don't result in a win.\n\nExciting Graphics\nThis Lightning Box slot machine is set on a tranquil Polynesian island somewhere in the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean. Around the reels are palm trees, sand, sea, and some fantastic tribal tiki statues, while the reels themselves are adorned with images of tropical nature. There are bright and beautiful flowers, toucans, a furnace carved with features of the Easter Island's face, and a native holding flames in the palm of their hand. It's the usual kind of things you'd find in a seaside resort...\n\nIn fact, as you start spinning the reels, you'll notice a lot of strange events taking place. In particular, the Blazing Goddess symbol appears from time to time, contributing to creating winning combinations by replacing other gameplay symbols and doubling the value of completed wins. In fact, her wild icon has so much strength and power that it momentarily sets the reels ablaze with fire as the Blazing Goddess's eyes transform into a blinding white light. It's certainly spectacular, but you may begin to sense that this won't be such a peaceful tropical retreat after all!\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nPlayers will find it tough to catch a break once they realize there's a boiling, smoking volcano on the island. This volcano serves as the game's scatter symbol, and when three or more appear on the reels in any position, things begin to heat up a bit too uncomfortably. This is because it triggers a bonus spin, awakening the Blazing Goddess from her slumber deep inside the volcano. Now, we don't know her personally, but generally speaking, abruptly waking someone up is never a good idea, let alone a fiery, crazy woman with the power of the gods and the skies at her command. We mean, that's just asking for trouble. And, as such, the Blazing Goddess doesn't seem too pleased to be disturbed as she starts hurling fiery rocks at the second, third, and fourth reels of the slot machine. Although we advise you to take cover during this eruption of rage, it's not all that bad. This is because it triggers 6 free spins as all those blazing fireballs attach themselves to the reels and act as extra wilds, increasing players' chances of earning hot wins.\n\nThis slot machine features 1,024 ways to win, meaning there aren't any particular paylines to worry about. Instead, players can find winning prizes whenever matching symbols appear on adjacent reels on the 5x4 grid, going from the leftmost reel that moves to the right. Available lines range from 0.01 to 5.00 credits, with the selected value multiplied 50 times to calculate the total bet. Once players have set their bets, they can press the spin button that appears in the bottom right corner of the screen and watch as those matching symbols fall into place. Alternatively, players can press the autospin button to set up continuous rotation action. Despite its name, Blazing Goddess may not be a true bolt from the blue. Its high-quality design and discreet range of features still make it very playable. And if the goddess of fire works her magic, there are some potentially big wins in store. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nThe Blazing Goddess slot machine is based on a very strong female figure that experienced gamblers must harness in order to win fantastic prizes. With a similar theme, there is also Fire Queen, a slot produced by WMS, with 11 reels and 100 paylines. It's based on the Fire Queen, a queen responsible for protecting the treasures of her land and therefore willing to do anything to keep them safe from your clutches.\n            ",
