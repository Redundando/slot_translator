However, it is still very aesthetically pleasing and well-crafted, as is the case with most Red Tiger Gaming games.\n\nAt first glance, one might say that Cinderella's Ball is mostly aimed at a female audience, but thanks to its intuitive yet captivating gameplay, it can provide a satisfying gaming experience even for those who are not fans of fairy tales.\n\nMain Features of the Slot\n\nIn terms of gameplay structure, Cinderella's Ball is a relatively simple slot consisting of five reels, three rows, and 20 total pay lines. Its betting range is very interesting, ranging from just 20 cents up to the challenging amount of €500 per spin, which caters to both casual punters and high rollers alike.\n\nWith a little luck, playing Cinderella's Ball can bring home a maximum prize of up to 800 times the value of your bet!\n\nHowever, one downside is the theoretical return to player (RTP) of this magical slot, which at 95.23% is not particularly profitable.\n\nAs for volatility, Cinderella's Ball has medium variance, which means that there will be small prizes that are more or less constant. Still, if you're patient enough, you may land some highly rewarding wins.\n\nSymbols and Features of Cinderella's Ball\n\nThe symbols in Cinderella's Ball are divided into thematic and non-thematic, with the latter represented by the four suits of playing cards. The thematic symbols include the carriage, the castle, the glass slipper, the magic wand, and others.\n\nThe most interesting thing about this Red Tiger Gaming slot machine is undoubtedly the opportunity to play different bonus rounds that enhance the fun and translate into exciting winning possibilities.\n\nAmong others, we can mention the Bonus Ballroom feature, where several scrolls appear on the screen from which the player can choose until they find three of the same color.

The range of bets is very interesting, going from just 20 cents to the challenging amount of €500 per spin, fully satisfying both casual bettors and high rollers. \n\nWith a bit of luck, playing Cinderella's Ball you can take home a maximum prize worth up to 800 times the value of your bet! \n\nAmong the cons, we must highlight the theoretical return to player percentage of this magical slot: with a 95.23% RTP, Cinderella's Ball is not a very profitable game.\n\nRegarding volatility, Cinderella's Ball is of average variance, meaning that there will be some small more or less constant prizes, but with a little bit of patience, you can also get very profitable winnings.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Cinderella's Ball\nThe symbols of Cinderella's Ball are divided into thematic and non-thematic, with the latter represented by the four suits of the playing cards.\n\nThe thematic symbols include the carriage, the castle, the crystal slipper, the magic wand, and others.\n\nThe most interesting aspect of this Red Tiger Gaming slot machine is undoubtedly the possibility of playing various bonus rounds that amplify the fun and translate into interesting winning opportunities.\n\nAmong other things, we highlight the Bonus Ballroom function, where several scrolls appear on the screen from which you can choose until you find three of the same color, allowing the player to get the maximum prize worth up to 800 times the value of the bet.\n        ",
