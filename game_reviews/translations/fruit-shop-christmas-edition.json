The game offers no scatter symbol, but instead, it includes a wild symbol (the game's logo) that works as a wild and also offers a x2 multiplier. The more cherries you get, the more free spins you will gain. Specifically, 2 or 3 cherries give one free spin, 4 give 2, and with 5, you have 5 free spins. Less valuable symbols, such as melons, lemons, oranges, and plums, give fewer free spins for winning combinations with three, four, or five identical symbols.\n\nAvailability and Versions\n\nFruit Shop Christmas Edition is available to play online through NetEnt's catalog of slot games. This Christmas version is based on the beloved classic Fruit Shop slot game. The Christmas theme adds some Christmas-related symbols to the game while keeping its fruit-machine roots. You can play the game on your computer and mobile devices, both with real money and in demo version. It is a fun and easy game for beginners and experienced players alike.\n\n        \n            ",

The theme is easy to understand: it refers to the Fruit Machine tradition, with the addition of a little snow and some symbols related to Christmas!\nFruit Machines are the very first slot machines ever: in bar rooms, the old three-reel machines had some colorful fruits among their symbols, to the point that the logo of slot machines in general was represented by cherries, the mythical Cherries!\nOver the years, the best software houses have proposed hyper-technological slots, with spectacular special effects, which almost seem like action movies or video games (see, for example, Gladiator, based on the eponymous cinematic colossal), despite this, no innovation has managed to erase the Fruit Machines! Fruity slots, characterized not only by minimalist graphics and easy and intuitive gameplay, as well as capturing nostalgics, often represent the first approach to slot machines for players who are new to this world.\nMain features of the slot machine\nFruitshop Christmas Edition has a very simple game grid, with five reels and three rows, framed in the market stall that we had already seen in the previous version, with a snowman on the left and colored lights.\nThere are only 15 paylines but there are as many as 70 betting combinations, with bets starting from just 0.01 token and 10 levels of play.\nFruitshop Christmas Edition is very easy and intuitive to play, despite this, it offers good winning opportunities and will certainly not bore you!\nYou can play Fruitshop Christmas Edition on your computer and mobile devices, both with real money and in demo version, to have fun without spending a single penny!\nSymbols and features of Fruitshop Christmas Edition\nNetEnt always includes interesting features in its games and even in this case, despite Fruitshop Christmas Edition being a fairly simple slot, it hides some pretty good functions!\nThis fruity-Christmas slot has a new free spins feature: each winning spin, in fact, not only pays the winnings but also gives a variable number of free spins, according to the following scheme:\n• 2 or 3 cherries give one free spin, 4 give 2 and with 5 you have 5 free spins\n• Melons, lemons, oranges, and plums, which have less value than cherries, give one free spin for a winning combination of 3 symbols, two if the symbols are 4 and finally, three free spins if the winning combination is made up of 5 identical symbols.\nDue to this particular mode of free spin awarding, there is no Scatter symbol, but instead, there is a Wild symbol, represented by the game logo, which has the function of a wild and also offers a x2 multiplier.\n            ",

The theme is easy to understand: it refers to the Fruit Machine tradition, with the addition of a little snow and some symbols related to Christmas!\nFruit Machines are the very first slot machines ever: in bar rooms, the old three-reel machines had some colorful fruits among their symbols, to the point that the logo of slot machines in general was represented by cherries, the mythical Cherries!\nOver the years, the best software houses have proposed hyper-technological slots, with spectacular special effects, which almost seem like action movies or video games (see, for example, Gladiator, based on the eponymous cinematic colossal), despite this, no innovation has managed to erase the Fruit Machines! Fruity slots, characterized not only by minimalist graphics and easy and intuitive gameplay, as well as capturing nostalgics, often represent the first approach to slot machines for players who are new to this world.\nMain features of the slot machine\nFruitshop Christmas Edition has a very simple game grid, with five reels and three rows, framed in the market stall that we had already seen in the previous version, with a snowman on the left and colored lights.\nThere are only 15 paylines but there are as many as 70 betting combinations, with bets starting from just 0.01 token and 10 levels of play.\nFruitshop Christmas Edition is very easy and intuitive to play, despite this, it offers good winning opportunities and will certainly not bore you!\nYou can play Fruitshop Christmas Edition on your computer and mobile devices, both with real money and in demo version, to have fun without spending a single penny!\nSymbols and features of Fruitshop Christmas Edition\nNetEnt always includes interesting features in its games and even in this case, despite Fruitshop Christmas Edition being a fairly simple slot, it hides some pretty good functions!\nThis fruity-Christmas slot has a new free spins feature: each winning spin, in fact, not only pays the winnings but also gives a variable number of free spins, according to the following scheme:\n• 2 or 3 cherries give one free spin, 4 give 2 and with 5 you have 5 free spins\n• Melons, lemons, oranges, and plums, which have less value than cherries, give one free spin for a winning combination of 3 symbols, two if the symbols are 4 and finally, three free spins if the winning combination is made up of 5 identical symbols.\nDue to this particular mode of free spin awarding, there is no Scatter symbol, but instead, there is a Wild symbol, represented by the game logo, which has the function of a wild and also offers a x2 multiplier.\n        ",
