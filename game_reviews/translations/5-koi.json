Se siete dei frequentatori abituali di casinò online è molto probabile che vi siate imbattuti in uno dei suoi prodotti.\n5 Koi è una slot a tema asiatico, in cui la protagonista è la carpa, simbolo che rappresenta il buon auspicio per le popolazioni orientali.\nMa in generale tutti i simboli presenti nella slot rimandano al concetto di fortuna, come ad esempio le carte rosse o gli ideogrammi con la scritta Lucky, termine che in inglese vuol dire proprio «fortuna».\nCome accennato poco più in alto, la grafica è molto semplice, senza grandi animazioni né effetti sonori, se si eccettua il suono meccanico della rotazione dei rulli. Lo sfondo di gioco è bianco, con la griglia delimitata da una cornice dorata. I colori leggermente opachi e le linee nette che compongono i simboli, rendono il gioco rilassante alla vista.\nNella parte bassa sono posizionati tutti i tasti che permettono di variare la scommessa, il riassunto delle vincite, il tasto Gamble, quello Start e l’Autoplay.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nCome di consueto, la griglia ha 5 rulli e 3 righe. Si può decidere se impostare 25 o 30 linee di pagamento, al costo di 0,04 € per linea. Nel primo caso, la scommessa totale sarà di 1 € a Spin, nel secondo caso di 1,20 €. Il costo massimo per linea è di 3 €.\nLe combinazioni valide sono quelle a partire dall’estrema sinistra verso destra e si possono impostare sino a un massimo di 100 giri automatici.\n5 Koi ha un valore RTP pari al 95,3%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nI simboli di basso valore sono le carte da gioco dal 9 all’asso, quelli di alto valore sono i simboli tematici. tra questi ultimi al gradino più basso troviamo le carte della fortuna, seguite dai cerchi di diversi colori con gli ideogrammi tradotti in inglese: Fortuna, Ricchezza, In bocca al lupo e Prosperità.\nLa carpa verde è il nostro simbolo Wild, può apparire solo sui rulli 2, 3 e 4 e va a sostituire tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter, qui rappresentato dal piatto dorato con il centro di colore rosso.\nLo Scatter è pagante e se ne compaiono almeno 3 da destra a sinistra si attiva la funzione Bonus. In questo caso dovremmo scegliere quale bonus ricevere cliccando sulla relativa icona. Ecco una panoramica dell’offerta:\n\nCarpa bianca: 20 Free Spins e un moltiplicatore di 2, 3 o 5\nCarpa rossa: 15 Free Spins ma un moltiplicatore di 3, 5 o 8\nCarpa marrone: 10 Free Spins e un moltiplicatore di 5, 8 o 10\nCarpa celeste: 8 Free Spins e un moltiplicatore di 8, 10 o 15\nCarpa gialla: 5 Free Spins e un moltiplicatore di 10, 15 o 30\n\nDurante i giri gratuiti, ogni carta della fortuna che compare sui rulli 1 e 5 regala un bonus moltiplicatore di 50, 20, 15, 10, 5 o 2. La funzione Bonus può essere riattivata.\nIn 5 koi è possibile anche usufruire della funzione gamble. In tal caso si scommetterà l’ultima vincita e si potrà raddoppiare la somma. Per vincere è necessario dire se la carta che girerà il banco sarà rossa o nera. Si può scommettere sino a 5 volte nello stesso turno Gamble.\n",

Keep an eye out for the green carp, as it serves as the Wild symbol and can only appear on reels 2-4, substituting all symbols except for the Scatter, which is represented by the  red-centered golden plate. Three or more Scatter symbols activate the Bonus function - and this is where the game really heats up. </p>\n\n    <p>Are you ready for the bonus features? Let's dive in! Players can choose from five different bonuses, each with its unique combination of free spins and multipliers, that make this game exciting and unpredictable.</p>\n\n    <p>The White Carp bonus offers 20 free spins and a 2x, 3x, or 5x multiplier. Pretty good odds, right? But don't stop there! The Red Carp bonus offers 15 free spins with a 3x, 5x, or 8x multiplier. Not bad at all! The Brown Carp bonus gives you 10 free spins and a 5x, 8x, or 10x multiplier. The Blue Carp lets you enjoy 8 free spins, 8x, 10x, or 15x multiplier while the Yellow Carp bonus offers 5 free spins and a massive 10x, 15x, or 30x multiplier. That's enough to make even the most seasoned slot player catch their breath!</p>\n\n    <p>But wait - there's more!

The company prides themselves on simplicity, and \"5 Koi\" is no exception. Based on an Asian theme, the game features the carp, a symbol of good fortune in oriental cultures. All symbols in the game relate to the concept of luck, such as red cards and Lucky ideograms.\n\nThe graphics are basic, with no flashy animations or sound effects aside from the mechanical sounds of the reels spinning. The white background and golden frame create a calming playing ambiance. All buttons to adjust betting, view winnings, gamble, start, and set autoplay are located at the bottom.\n\nThe game has the usual 5 reels and 3 rows, and players can choose between 25 or 30 pay lines at the cost of €0.04 per line, resulting in a total bet of €1 or €1.20 per spin respectively. The maximum cost per line stands at €3, and up to 100 automatic spins can be set. Its RTP value is at 95.3%.\n\nLow-value symbols are the standard 9-A, while high-value symbols include fortune cards and color-coded circles with English translations such as \"Fortune\", \"Wealth\", \"Good Luck\", and \"Prosperity\". The green carp serves as the Wild symbol and can only appear on reels 2-4, substituting all symbols except for the Scatter, represented by a red-centered golden plate. Three or more Scatters activate the Bonus function, allowing players to choose between five different bonuses.\n\nWhite Carp: 20 Free Spins and a 2, 3, or 5 multiplier.\nRed Carp: 15 Free Spins with a 3, 5, or 8 multiplier.\nBrown Carp: 10 Free Spins and a 5, 8, or 10 multiplier.\nBlue Carp: 8 Free Spins and a 8, 10, or 15 multiplier.\nYellow Carp: 5 Free Spins and a 10, 15, or 30 multiplier.\n\nFortune cards that appear on reels 1 and 5 during free spins grant a bonus multiplier of 50, 20, 15, 10, 5, or 2. The Bonus feature can be reactivated. The game also offers a Gamble function, allowing players to guess the color of the banker's card to double their winnings, with up to five guesses allowed per turn.\n\nOverall, \"5 Koi\" is a straightforward game with potential for decent winnings and a relaxing playing experience. If you're looking for a simple and enjoyable slot game, \"5 Koi\" is definitely worth trying.\n            ",
