Le combinazioni vincenti si ottengono, come quasi sempre accade, quando sui rulli adiacenti compaiono dei simboli identici, per allineamenti che vanno da sinistra verso destra.\nI simboli si ispirano alla cultura egiziana e includono la croce della vita, una piramide, lo scarabeo d’oro e altri amuleti; oltre a questi sono presenti i numeri e le lettere che si riferiscono alle carte da gioco, stavolta solamente dal J all’Asso.\nIl simbolo Wild del gioco è rappresentato dalla testa del dio Anubi con sembianze canine che, oltre a essere il jolly che può sostituire tutti gli altri simboli tranne lo Scatter per realizzare delle combinazioni vincenti, consente anche di accedere a una funzione speciale in cui acquisisce maggior valore.\nLo Scatter del gioco è invece una chiave, che se compare sui rulli almeno per tre volte regala un numero variabile di giri gratuiti; in questo caso l’unica particolarità è data dal fatto che per il primo giro gratuito non potranno essere presenti sui rulli degli ulteriori simboli Scatter.\nI giri gratuiti rappresentano una ghiotta possibilità per ottenere delle vincite sostanziose: durante i free spins infatti potrete usufruire di ricchi moltiplicatori che potranno regalarvi dei premi con un valore fino a 15.000 volte la vostra puntata!\nAutoplay e RTP\nSe vi piacciono le slot machine che funzionano anche in modalità automatica, Ankh of Anubis è una di queste e vi dà la possibilità di impostare grazie alla funzione Autoplay il numero di giri gratuiti che desiderate: a questo punto non vi resterà che osservare i rulli che girano e incrociare le dita sperando nella buona sorte!\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore di Ankh of Anubis si attesta su una percentuale del 96,2%: non possiamo dire che sia alta ma sicuramente è in linea con la maggior parte delle altre slot machine che potrete trovare online sulle varie piattaforme di gioco!\n",

This game's traditional gameplay structure may be familiar to seasoned slot players, but it's not without its unique twists and turns. For starters, you'll notice that three symbols appear on the outer two reels, while a whopping five symbols adorn the central reels. It's like a game of spot the difference, but instead of winning a teddy bear, you're in for some serious winnings if you can land identical symbols on adjacent reels, from left to right.</p><p>Speaking of symbols, Ankh of Anubis is full of impressive and culturally accurate representations of ancient Egyptian culture. From the iconic Ankh symbol to the mystical scarab beetle, these symbols are rich with meaning and history. And let's not forget the playing cards, which may seem out of place but add a touch of levity to the game. After all, who doesn't love seeing a royal flush staring back at them?</p><p>But let's get real: the real star of the show here is the wild symbol. Represented by the head of the powerful god Anubis, this wildcard can replace all other symbols (except for the Scatter) to help you form winning combinations. And when it comes to the Scatter symbol - oh boy. If you can land this key icon on the reels three times or more, you'll trigger a variable number of free spins that are anything but ordinary. In fact, for your first free spin, you won't see a single additional Scatter symbol on the reels. You heard that right - it's time to make that winning potential skyrocket with the help of the key symbol.</p><p>But the bonus features don't stop there! During free spins mode, you can unlock multipliers that take your winning potential to new heights. How high, you ask? Brace yourself. We're talking up to 15,000 times more than your initial bet.

This game's traditional gameplay structure may be familiar to seasoned slot players, but it's not without its unique twists and turns. For starters, you'll notice that three symbols appear on the outer two reels, while a whopping five symbols adorn the central reels. It's like a game of spot the difference, but instead of winning a teddy bear, you're in for some serious winnings if you can land identical symbols on adjacent reels, from left to right.</p><p>Speaking of symbols, Ankh of Anubis is full of impressive and culturally accurate representations of ancient Egyptian culture. From the iconic Ankh symbol to the mystical scarab beetle, these symbols are rich with meaning and history. And let's not forget the playing cards, which may seem out of place but add a touch of levity to the game. After all, who doesn't love seeing a royal flush staring back at them?</p><p>But let's get real: the real star of the show here is the wild symbol. Represented by the head of the powerful god Anubis, this wildcard can replace all other symbols (except for the Scatter) to help you form winning combinations. And when it comes to the Scatter symbol - oh boy. If you can land this key icon on the reels three times or more, you'll trigger a variable number of free spins that are anything but ordinary. In fact, for your first free spin, you won't see a single additional Scatter symbol on the reels. You heard that right - it's time to make that winning potential skyrocket with the help of the key symbol.</p><p>But the bonus features don't stop there! During free spins mode, you can unlock multipliers that take your winning potential to new heights. How high, you ask? Brace yourself. We're talking up to 15,000 times more than your initial bet. That's right - it's not just a mirage in the desert heat. It's Ankh of Anubis, and it's waiting for you to uncover its hidden riches.</p>\"\n}"

Despite a lack of originality, the game has well-crafted graphics and a futuristic pyramid background that sets it apart.\n\nSymbol Layout and Design\n\nAnkh of Anubis follows a traditional gameplay structure. The symbols are inspired by ancient Egyptian culture and the playing cards from Jack to Ace. The Ankh symbol serves as the cross of life, while others include a pyramid, a golden scarab, and amulets. The game has three symbols on the outer reels and five on the center ones.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nThe Wild symbol is the head of the god Anubis with canine features. It replaces any other symbol except for the Scatter to form winning combinations. When it appears, the Wild can also trigger a special function where it acquires greater value. The Scatter symbol is the key, and three or more of them triggers free spins.\n\nFree Spin and Multiplier Feature\n\nFree spins in Ankh of Anubis come with rich multipliers that can lead to substantial winnings. The Scatter symbol triggers this feature and the number of free spins varies. During the first free spin, additional Scatters cannot appear on the reels. You can win up to 15,000 times your bet during free spins.\n\nAutoplay Function and Return to Player\n\nAnkh of Anubis offers an autoplay function allowing players to set the number of free spins they want. The theoretical return to player is 96.2%, which is in line with most other online slot games.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and Features:\n\nAnkh of Anubis has a somewhat traditional gameplay structure, with a notable exception where three symbols are present on the outer two reels whereas five symbols appear on the central reels. Winning combinations occur when identical symbols appear on adjacent reels, left to right. The game symbols in Ankh of Anubis represent Egyptian culture and include the Ankh symbol, pyramid, the golden scarab, and other amulets, in addition to playing cards (from Jack to Ace). The Wild symbol in Ankh of Anubis is the head of the god Anubis, which acts as a wildcard and can replace all other symbols except for the Scatter to form winning combinations. The game's Scatter symbol is a key, which if it appears on the reels three times or more, triggers a variable number of free spins, with the remarkable feature that for the first free spin, there cannot be any additional Scatter symbols on the reels. During free spins mode, you can unlock multipliers that increase winning potentials, up to 15,000 times more than your bet!\n\nSymbol Design and Theme:\n\nThe theme of Ankh of Anubis is based around the Egyptian god Anubis. The graphics development is highly detailed, with finely crafted images and a futuristic pyramid-styled background. The symbols pay homage to the Egyptian culture and include standard 10-Ace playing-card values, the Ankh symbol for the cross of life, the golden scarab, and pyramid, amongst other amulets. Anubis, with canine features, represents the Wild symbol and can replace all other symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter symbol takes the form of a key, unlockable by appearing on the reels three times or more, to trigger free spins. The sound effects are consistent with the theme, which transports the player to the shade of the pyramids while spinning the reels.\n\nBonuses and Multipliers:\n\nAnkh of Anubis offers regular wins achieved by landing identical symbols on adjacent reels, left to right. The Wild, represented by Anubis, increases winning potentials by replacing other symbols and can trigger a special feature where it acquires greater value. Land the Scatter on the reels three times or more to enter the free spins mode, which has no cap on the number of times it can be retriggered. During free spins, there are multipliers which can add to your winning amount, increasing the potential win up to 15,000 times your wagered amount.\n\nAutoplay Function:\n\nAnkh of Anubis features an Autoplay function that allows players to set the number of automatic spins they desire. Watch the spins play out and test your luck while taking a break from manually spinning the reels.\n\nDemo Mode and Return to Player:\n\nAnkh of Anubis has a demo mode giving players the opportunity to try out the game before wagering real funds. The theoretical return to player (RTP) percentage of the game is 96.2%, which may not be the highest but certainly falls in line with many of the online slot games found across various gaming platforms.\n\n        \n            ",

Winning combinations are obtained, as almost always, when identical symbols appear on adjacent reels, for alignments that go from left to right.\n\nThe symbols are inspired by Egyptian culture and include the Ankh symbol for the cross of life, a pyramid, the golden scarab, and other amulets; in addition to these, there are also numbers and letters that refer to playing cards, this time only from Jack to Ace.\n\nThe game's Wild symbol is represented by the head of the god Anubis with canine features, which, in addition to being the wildcard that can replace all other symbols except for the Scatter to form winning combinations, also allows access to a special function in which it acquires greater value.\n\nThe game's Scatter is instead a key, which if it appears on the reels at least three times, gives a variable number of free spins; in this case, the only peculiarity is given by the fact that for the first free spin, there cannot be any additional Scatter symbols on the reels.\n\nFree spins represent an excellent opportunity to obtain substantial winnings: during free spins, in fact, you can take advantage of rich multipliers that can give you prizes with a value of up to 15,000 times your bet!\n\nAutoplay and RTP\n\nIf you like slot machines that also work in automatic mode, Ankh of Anubis is one of them and gives you the possibility to set the number of free spins you want thanks to the Autoplay function: at this point, you just have to watch the wheels spin and cross your fingers hoping for good luck!\n\nThe theoretical return to player of Ankh of Anubis is 96.2%: we cannot say that it is high, but it is certainly in line with most of the other slot machines that you can find online on various gaming platforms!\n            ",

Winning combinations are obtained, as almost always, when identical symbols appear on adjacent reels, for alignments that go from left to right.\n\nThe symbols are inspired by Egyptian culture and include the Ankh symbol for the cross of life, a pyramid, the golden scarab, and other amulets; in addition to these, there are also numbers and letters that refer to playing cards, this time only from Jack to Ace.\n\nThe game's Wild symbol is represented by the head of the god Anubis with canine features, which, in addition to being the wildcard that can replace all other symbols except for the Scatter to form winning combinations, also allows access to a special function in which it acquires greater value.\n\nThe game's Scatter is instead a key, which if it appears on the reels at least three times, gives a variable number of free spins; in this case, the only peculiarity is given by the fact that for the first free spin, there cannot be any additional Scatter symbols on the reels.\n\nFree spins represent an excellent opportunity to obtain substantial winnings: during free spins, in fact, you can take advantage of rich multipliers that can give you prizes with a value of up to 15,000 times your bet!\n\nAutoplay and RTP\n\nIf you like slot machines that also work in automatic mode, Ankh of Anubis is one of them and gives you the possibility to set the number of free spins you want thanks to the Autoplay function: at this point, you just have to watch the wheels spin and cross your fingers hoping for good luck!\n\nThe theoretical return to player of Ankh of Anubis is 96.2%: we cannot say that it is high, but it is certainly in line with most of the other slot machines that you can find online on various gaming platforms!\n            ",
