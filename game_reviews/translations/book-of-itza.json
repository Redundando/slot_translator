Non manca neppure un Jolly che permette di attivare una funzione in espansione con animazioni molto carine, oltre allo Scatter che è il libro e permette di accedere alla funzione di giri gratuiti.

This online machine has a 5-reel, 4-row structure and offers 1,024 different ways to win. It features an innovative mechanism for forming combinations. If you find the same symbol on consecutive rows from left to right, you can make your winning combination, which can pay you out with over a thousand combinations. Its RTP is also interesting as it is set at 96.3% with medium volatility.\n\nSlot Graphics\n\nCeremonial masks, a tribal chief, gold coins, and a book: these are just some of the icons that the provider chose to use for this slot. At a design level, everything is very clean, perhaps with more restrained graphics compared to other PariPlay titles, but the effect is well executed. There is also a wild that allows you to activate an expansion function with very nice animations, as well as a scatter, which is the book and allows you to access the free spin function. The soundtrack is also well designed, with melodies and percussion that mark the turns and the entire betting session.\n\nGame features and special functionalities\n\nAs we mentioned, this slot has medium volatility, meaning that its gameplay is very balanced. There may be big payouts to award with low frequency. To win, you need to match the most profitable symbols. Among all of them, the wild returns 200 times the total bet. Then comes the image of the tribal chief, which is worth a prize of 150x, the feather crown at 100x, and with the golden mask, you can win up to 25x the bet placed. If we consider less profitable symbols, with playing cards, you can win from 11 to 15x the total bet.\n\nRemember that wilds can be fixed and cover an entire reel, unlocking the Sticky Expanded Wild Respins special feature. If you find 3 or more scatters, you can activate the free spin feature, with 12 spins available.\n\nFinal considerations on the Book of Itza slot\n\nAfter trying it out, we can say that Book of Itza is a great slot to try even if you have little experience with online betting. Its design is pleasant, and its features are simple but well designed. It takes a bit of patience to activate them and to be rewarded accordingly. The highest point of luck is represented by the expanding wild that can skyrocket the value of any prize. This factor could demotivate more experienced players, as they always seek to bet on features that are greater than those presented by the slot.",

The design is very clean, perhaps with more subdued graphics than other PariPlay titles, but the effect is well achieved.

To achieve them, you need to match the most lucrative symbols. Among all of them, there is the wild that returns 200 times the total bet. Then comes the image of the tribal chief, which is worth a prize of 150x, the feather crown at 100x, and with the golden mask you get up to 25x the bet placed.

Its design is pleasant, its features are simple but well designed. It will take a little patience to activate them and be properly rewarded. The highest point of luck is represented by the expanding wild, which can skyrocket the value of each prize.

It offers a unique mechanism for forming combinations where identical symbols on consecutive rows from left to right constitute a winning combination. The game has an RTP of 96.3% and medium volatility. The game is well-balanced and offers a chance to hit big wins, albeit at a low frequency.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nThe Aztec theme of Book of Itza is well-executed with ceremonial masks, a tribal chief, gold coins, and a book, forming the game's symbols. The graphics of the game are clean and well-designed, although they are more subdued than other PariPlay titles. The animations within the game are smooth and enjoyable, especially the expanding wild feature. The sound effects and soundtrack complement the theme and provide an immersive gaming experience.\n\nSymbols and payouts\n\nBook of Itza's most lucrative symbol is the wild that returns 200 times the total bet. The Tribal Chief symbol is worth 150x the bet, while the feather crown offers a prize of 100x and the golden mask up to 25x the bet placed. The playing cards are the least lucrative symbols, with winnings ranging from 11 to 15x the total bet. The expanding wild feature can cover an entire reel, triggering the Sticky Expanded Wild Respins, which can help players increase their winnings. Receiving three or more scatter symbols triggers 12 free spins.\n\nVariance and RTP\n\nWith an RTP of 96.3% and medium volatility, Book of Itza offers a well-balanced gameplay experience. Players have a chance to win big, but it may take time to activate all features offered in the game.

It offers straightforward and well-designed features that elevate the gaming experience. Although it may take some time to activate all the features, the game's medium volatility ensures a good balance between smaller and bigger wins. Experienced players may find the game less appealing if they are looking for more significant payouts, but the expanding wild feature provides a thrilling and exciting gaming experience.\n\n        \n            ",

The online machine has a structure of 5 reels and 4 rows, in addition to offering 1,024 different ways to win. It also provides an innovative mechanism for forming combinations. In fact, if you find the same symbol on consecutive rows from left to right, you can make your winning combination. And so, it can pay out over a thousand combinations. Its RTP is also very interesting, set at 96.3% with medium volatility.\n\nSlot graphics\nCeremonial masks, a tribal chief, gold coins, and a book: these are just some of the icons the provider has chosen to use to tell this slot story. The design is very clean, perhaps with more subdued graphics than other PariPlay titles, but the effect is well achieved. There is also a wild that activates an expansion feature with very nice animations, as well as a scatter that is the book and allows access to the free spin feature. The soundtrack is also well thought out, with melodies and percussion that punctuate spins and the entire betting session.\n\nGame features and special functionality\nAs we said, the volatility of this slot is medium, meaning that its gameplay is well balanced: there can be some big wins to be awarded at a low frequency. To achieve them, you need to match the most lucrative symbols. Among all of them, there is the wild that returns 200 times the total bet. Then comes the image of the tribal chief, which is worth a prize of 150x, the feather crown at 100x, and with the golden mask you get up to 25x the bet placed. If we instead consider the less lucrative symbols, with the playing cards, you can win from 11 to 15x the total bet.\n\nRemember that wilds can be fixed and cover an entire reel, unlocking the special Sticky Expanded Wild Respins feature. If you find 3 or more scatters, you can activate free spins, with 12 spins available.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Book of Itza slot\nAfter trying it out, we can say that Book of Itza is a valid slot to try even if you have little experience in online betting. Its design is pleasant, its features are simple but well designed. It will take a little patience to activate them and be properly rewarded. The highest point of luck is represented by the expanding wild, which can skyrocket the value of each prize. This factor could demotivate more experienced players, as they always look for features that are greater than those presented by the slot.\n            ",

The online machine has a structure of 5 reels and 4 rows, in addition to offering 1,024 different ways to win. It also provides an innovative mechanism for forming combinations. In fact, if you find the same symbol on consecutive rows from left to right, you can make your winning combination. And so, it can pay out over a thousand combinations. Its RTP is also very interesting, set at 96.3% with medium volatility.\n\nSlot graphics\nCeremonial masks, a tribal chief, gold coins, and a book: these are just some of the icons the provider has chosen to use to tell this slot story. The design is very clean, perhaps with more subdued graphics than other PariPlay titles, but the effect is well achieved. There is also a wild that activates an expansion feature with very nice animations, as well as a scatter that is the book and allows access to the free spin feature. The soundtrack is also well thought out, with melodies and percussion that punctuate spins and the entire betting session.\n\nGame features and special functionality\nAs we said, the volatility of this slot is medium, meaning that its gameplay is well balanced: there can be some big wins to be awarded at a low frequency. To achieve them, you need to match the most lucrative symbols. Among all of them, there is the wild that returns 200 times the total bet. Then comes the image of the tribal chief, which is worth a prize of 150x, the feather crown at 100x, and with the golden mask you get up to 25x the bet placed. If we instead consider the less lucrative symbols, with the playing cards, you can win from 11 to 15x the total bet.\n\nRemember that wilds can be fixed and cover an entire reel, unlocking the special Sticky Expanded Wild Respins feature. If you find 3 or more scatters, you can activate free spins, with 12 spins available.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Book of Itza slot\nAfter trying it out, we can say that Book of Itza is a valid slot to try even if you have little experience in online betting. Its design is pleasant, its features are simple but well designed. It will take a little patience to activate them and be properly rewarded. The highest point of luck is represented by the expanding wild, which can skyrocket the value of each prize. This factor could demotivate more experienced players, as they always look for features that are greater than those presented by the slot.\n            ",
