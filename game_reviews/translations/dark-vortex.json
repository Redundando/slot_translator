With more ways to win, you collect pink and blue spheres to win extra free spins and more wilds for the Vortex Free Spins feature. Playable on a 5x5 grid with 3,125 ways to win, wild stacks appear on the 3 middle reels for huge wins. This game offers a win of 7,318 times your bet on every free spin!\n\nAstonishing Graphics\n\nThe Dark Vortex has been activated by the forces of evil and is about to open a portal to a realm full of all things dark and miserable! This monster of a game is Win All Ways, so it has incredible winning potential with 3,125 ways that go both ways. Collect at least two cursed symbols on adjacent reels to open the vortex to the interdimensional afterlife - this will increase the reel height from 3 to 5 symbols and fill the vortex with high-paying symbols, wilds, and Free Spins enhancements.\n\nBy hitting the adjacent cursed relic symbols to the vortex, the passage will expand, and if it grows to cover all the reels, Free Spins with stacked wilds will be awarded! Here, all the features of the Free Spins collected from the vortex spins become active, destined to ensure some monstrous wins! So get ready to be lured by these primordial powers and give in to the Dark Vortex.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nDark Vortex is a Yggdrasil Gaming slot with 5 reels and between 243 and 3,125 ways to win. Available to play on all devices from 10p to 50 pounds per spin, a portal opens to go to a realm full of all things dark and miserable as the forces of evil unite in this magnificent offering. With win both ways pays, you collect Vortex symbols to open the vortex to give you more ways to win, as you can benefit from stacked wild and stacked high pay symbols. You’ll also see spheres that enhance your Free Spins experience. You can also buy your way into the Vortex Free Spins feature!\n\nKeep an eye on the Vortex symbol as 2 of them appearing on adjacent reels will convert them into Vortex reels to give you 3 Vortex spins - this is known as the Vortex Reels feature. These reels are 5 high instead of 3 high with the result of winning in more ways with each vortex reel in play. These Vortex reels contain stacked wild symbols and stacked high pay symbols.\n\nAlso, each extra adjacent Vortex symbol gives you an extra Vortex reel and 2 extra Vortex spins. These remain in play until all Vortex Spins have been played. The more Vortex reels that are opened, the more ways to win are possible, with a maximum of 3,125 ways to win in total.\n\nIn the Vortex Reels feature, orbital symbols may appear - these enhance the Vortex Free Spins feature that is triggered before Vortex Spins end. You have a pink orb - every 1 collected adds 1 extra wild to the 3 middle reels during free spins and land only on reels 1 and 5 of the Vortex. You also have blue orbs that give you an extra free spin in the Vortex Free Spins feature - these appear on Vortex reels 2, 3 and 4. Every time the Vortex opens, 5 blue orbs are automatically awarded. This is known as the Orbs Collection feature.\n\nSimilar Slot Games\n\nIf you enjoyed the setting and scenery of this slot game, we recommend betting your money on Vikings Go To Hell, another slot produced by the same Online Gambling provider, Yggdrasil. This time you are guaranteed only 25 paylines, but fortunately, there is a massive presence of bonuses!\n            ",

It offers more ways to win, as you can benefit from stacked wild and stacked high pay symbols. Playable on a 5x5 grid with 3,125 ways to win, wild stacks appear on the 3 middle reels for huge wins. This game offers a win of 7,318 times your bet on every free spin!\n\nSpecial features of Dark Vortex\n\nDark Vortex offers the Vortex Reels and Vortex Free Spins special features. The Vortex symbol opens the Vortex Reels feature to spin the Vortex. By hitting the adjacent cursed relic symbols to the vortex, the passage will expand to give you more chances to win. The Vortex Free Spins feature is triggered before Vortex Spins end. During vortex spins, every pink orb collected adds 1 extra wild to the 3 middle reels and every blue orb collected gives you an extra free spin. \n\nWinning potential of Dark Vortex\n\nWith 3,125 ways to win, Dark Vortex has a significant winning potential. If you collect at least two cursed symbols on adjacent reels to open the vortex to the interdimensional afterlife, it will fill the vortex with high-paying symbols, wilds, and Free Spins enhancements. Dark Vortex offers a win of 7,318 times your bet on every free spin!\n\nGraphics and theme of Dark Vortex\n\nThe graphics and the theme of Dark Vortex represent the kingdom full of evil forces. The game is designed to immerse the players in a realm full of dark and miserable things. The game's appearance and sound effects go along with the theme and provide an exciting gaming experience to the players.\n\nOther related games from Yggdrasil Gaming\n\nIf you enjoyed Dark Vortex, we recommend Vikings Go To Hell, another slot produced by the same Yggdrasil Gaming provider. The setting and scenery of both games are quite similar, but Vikings Go To Hell guarantees only 25 paylines. On the bright side, there is a massive presence of bonuses in it.\n\nDeveloper of Dark Vortex - Yggdrasil Gaming\n\nYggdrasil Gaming, a provider of digital online gaming solutions, has developed Dark Vortex. Yggdrasil Gaming has produced games with leading-edge technology, and it has become one of the most respected and acclaimed suppliers in the industry.\n\n        \n            ",

Here, all the features of the Free Spins collected from the vortex spins become active, destined to ensure some monstrous wins! So get ready to be lured by these primordial powers and give in to the Dark Vortex.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nDark Vortex is a Yggdrasil Gaming slot with 5 reels and between 243 and 3,125 ways to win. Available to play on all devices from 10p to 50 pounds per spin, a portal opens to go to a realm full of all things dark and miserable as the forces of evil unite in this magnificent offering.

These reels are 5 high instead of 3 high with the result of winning in more ways with each vortex reel in play. These Vortex reels contain stacked wild symbols and stacked high pay symbols.\n\nAlso, each extra adjacent Vortex symbol gives you an extra Vortex reel and 2 extra Vortex spins. These remain in play until all Vortex Spins have been played. The more Vortex reels that are opened, the more ways to win are possible, with a maximum of 3,125 ways to win in total.\n\nIn the Vortex Reels feature, orbital symbols may appear - these enhance the Vortex Free Spins feature that is triggered before Vortex Spins end. You have a pink orb - every 1 collected adds 1 extra wild to the 3 middle reels during free spins and land only on reels 1 and 5 of the Vortex. You also have blue orbs that give you an extra free spin in the Vortex Free Spins feature - these appear on Vortex reels 2, 3 and 4. Every time the Vortex opens, 5 blue orbs are automatically awarded. This is known as the Orbs Collection feature.\n\nSimilar Slot Games\n\nIf you enjoyed the setting and scenery of this slot game, we recommend betting your money on Vikings Go To Hell, another slot produced by the same Online Gambling provider, Yggdrasil.
