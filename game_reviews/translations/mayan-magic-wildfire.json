The wilds are the key to the action in this rainforest adventure. Land 1 on 3 central reels and earn a respin, complete with a sticky wild. Also on offer are transformed wilds and synchronized reels. Play on all devices from €0.10 to €10 per spin. \n\nNatural graphics:\nMayan Magic Wildfire is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 10 fixed lines, paying in both directions from left to right and right to left. Your expedition into Maya territory on desktop or mobile starts at 0.10 credits and reaches a peak of 100 credits per spin. The RTP of this medium variance game has not yet been confirmed, but it is estimated to be around 96%.\n\nOpen the game to find yourself in the midst of a lush jungle scene with a waterfall in the background. The game window without borders seems to be suspended on a stone structure that has a green gem at its center, which will play a fundamental role in one of the features. Elaborate graphics and rich colors dominate the reels along with a tribal soundtrack that increases suspense. \n\nThe long-standing Maya civilization provides the theme for this colorful Nolimit City online slot; it is called Mayan Magic Wildfire and offers players various smart wild features along with paylines that pay in both directions. Mayan Magic Wildfire is a five-reel slot with three rows and ten fixed paylines that pay in both directions, so the number is actually doubled. The reels spin in front of a cascading waterfall flanked by dense jungle, and the game is accompanied by delicate tribal sounds. Two members of the royal family, the priest, jaguar, and serpent represent the high-value symbols, while gold-plated jewels in red, purple, blue, and green make up the lower values.\n\nSlot machine functions and symbols:\nMaya Wilds Feature: This feature becomes active when you land a Wild in any position on the 3 central reels. A respin is awarded with a Sticky wild added to the central position on that reel. More wilds mean more respins. For example, if you landed 3 wilds on the trigger spin, you would receive 3 respins. Every wild that lands during the spin adds another spin to the total. After every third wild hits a multiplier increases by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild Feature: This can trigger at random on any spin. The symbol on the central position of reel 3 transforms into a wild. All instances of that symbol elsewhere on the central position of the 3 reels also become wild. The Maya Wild feature then follows.\n\nMystery Sync Feature: This can also be triggered at random on any spin. The symbols on the 3 central reels synchronize to create, hopefully, a new winning combination.\n\nThe design here is comic-style and works well. You'll hear the sound of the waterfall, the rainforest's noises, and the pipes from the background as you spin.\n\nThe range of features offered in Mayan Magic Wildfire is not extensive. However, the wild appearances can give some decent action, especially if you get involved with the Mayan Wilds and move the multiplier in the right direction - for a total of 1,264 times your stake.\n\nThe Mayan Wild triggers by landing a wild symbol anywhere on reels two, three, or four; the central position on reel three now becomes a Sticky wild, and you will receive one respin with each additional wild that triggers another spin. A wild landing on three increases the win multiplier by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild is a randomly triggered feature, and the symbol on the central position of reel three becomes wild along with any other instances of that symbol on reels two, three, and four.\n\nMystery Sync can also be triggered on any spin, and reels two, three, and four synchronize so that each row displays matching symbols, making it more likely for big wins to hit, especially since the paylines pay in both directions.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines:\nAre you a fan of jungle-themed online slots? You can try a spin on Jumanji.\n\nFor fans of mega, major, minor, and mini jackpots - Mega Moolah will be a good try. Damn, people have made millions of euros with a single spin on this game!",

Two members of the royal family, a priest, jaguar, and serpent represent the high-value symbols, while gold-plated jewels in red, purple, blue, and green make up the lower values.\n\nMaya Wilds Feature - This feature becomes active when you land a wild on any point of the 3 central reels. A respin is rewarded with a Sticky Wild added to the central position on that reel. More wilds mean more respins. For example, if you land 3 wilds on the triggering spin, you will receive 3 respins. Every wild that lands during the respin adds one more spin to the total. After every third wild lands, the win multiplier increases by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild Feature - This can trigger randomly on any spin. The symbol on the central position of reel 3 transforms into a wild. All instances of that symbol elsewhere on the central position of the 3 reels also become wilds. The Maya Wild feature then follows.\n\nMystery Sync Feature - This can also trigger randomly on any spin. The symbols on the 3 central reels synchronize to create, hopefully, a new winning combination.\n\nThe design of the game is in a comic book style and works well. You'll hear the cascading waterfalls, the sounds of the rainforest, and the hum of the infesting pans on the background as you spin.\n\nAlthough the range of features offered in Mayan Magic Wildfire is not vast, the appearance of Wilds can certainly provide decent action, especially if you trigger Maya Wilds and move the win multiplier in the right direction – for a total win of 1,264 times your stake.\n\nThe Mayan Wild is triggered by landing a wild symbol anywhere on reels two, three, and four; the central position on reel three now becomes a Sticky Wild, and you receive a respin with every additional wild that triggers another spin. One wild landing on three increases the win multiplier by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild is a randomly triggered feature, and the symbol on the central position of reel three becomes wild as well as any other instance of that symbol on reels two, three, and four.\n\nMystery Sync can also be randomly triggered, and reels two, three, and four synchronize so that each row displays the corresponding symbols, making it more likely for big wins to hit, especially since the paylines pay in both directions.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines:\n\nAre you a fan of jungle-themed online slots? Try taking a spin on Jumanji. For fans of the mega, major, minor, and mini jackpots – Mega Moolah is worth a try. Heck, people have won millions of euros with just one spin on this game!"

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay Features\nVisuals and Sound\nWinning Potential\nMayan Wilds Feature\nMystery Wild Feature\nMystery Sync Feature\nComparison to Similar Games\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Mayan Magic Wildfire:\nThe Central American jungle is the setting for Mayan Magic Wildfire, a colourful 5-reel, 10-payline Nolimit City slot with wins in both directions. The wilds are the key to the action in this rainforest adventure. Land 1 on 3 central reels and earn a respin, complete with a sticky wild. Also on offer are transformed wilds and synchronized reels. Play on all devices from €0.10 to €10 per spin. \n\nNatural graphics:\nMayan Magic Wildfire is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 10 fixed lines, paying in both directions from left to right and right to left. Your expedition into Maya territory on desktop or mobile starts at 0.10 credits and reaches a peak of 100 credits per spin. The RTP of this medium variance game has not yet been confirmed, but it is estimated to be around 96%.\n\nOpen the game to find yourself in the midst of a lush jungle scene with a waterfall in the background. The game window without borders seems to be suspended on a stone structure that has a green gem at its center, which will play a fundamental role in one of the features. Elaborate graphics and rich colors dominate the reels along with a tribal soundtrack that increases suspense. \n\nThe long-standing Maya civilization provides the theme for this colorful Nolimit City online slot; it is called Mayan Magic Wildfire and offers players various smart wild features along with paylines that pay in both directions. Mayan Magic Wildfire is a five-reel slot with three rows and ten fixed paylines that pay in both directions, so the number is actually doubled. The reels spin in front of a cascading waterfall flanked by dense jungle, and the game is accompanied by delicate tribal sounds. Two members of the royal family, the priest, jaguar, and serpent represent the high-value symbols, while gold-plated jewels in red, purple, blue, and green make up the lower values.\n\nSlot machine functions and symbols:\nMaya Wilds Feature: This feature becomes active when you land a Wild in any position on the 3 central reels. A respin is awarded with a Sticky wild added to the central position on that reel. More wilds mean more respins. For example, if you landed 3 wilds on the trigger spin, you would receive 3 respins. Every wild that lands during the spin adds another spin to the total. After every third wild hits a multiplier increases by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild Feature: This can trigger at random on any spin. The symbol on the central position of reel 3 transforms into a wild. All instances of that symbol elsewhere on the central position of the 3 reels also become wild. The Maya Wild feature then follows.\n\nMystery Sync Feature: This can also be triggered at random on any spin. The symbols on the 3 central reels synchronize to create, hopefully, a new winning combination.\n\nThe design here is comic-style and works well. You'll hear the sound of the waterfall, the rainforest's noises, and the pipes from the background as you spin.\n\nThe range of features offered in Mayan Magic Wildfire is not extensive. However, the wild appearances can give some decent action, especially if you get involved with the Mayan Wilds and move the multiplier in the right direction - for a total of 1,264 times your stake.\n\nThe Mayan Wild triggers by landing a wild symbol anywhere on reels two, three, or four; the central position on reel three now becomes a Sticky wild, and you will receive one respin with each additional wild that triggers another spin. A wild landing on three increases the win multiplier by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild is a randomly triggered feature, and the symbol on the central position of reel three becomes wild along with any other instances of that symbol on reels two, three, and four.\n\nMystery Sync can also be triggered on any spin, and reels two, three, and four synchronize so that each row displays matching symbols, making it more likely for big wins to hit, especially since the paylines pay in both directions.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines:\nAre you a fan of jungle-themed online slots? You can try a spin on Jumanji.\n\nFor fans of mega, major, minor, and mini jackpots - Mega Moolah will be a good try. Damn, people have made millions of euros with a single spin on this game!\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay features\n\nMayan Magic Wildfire offers a number of wild features including transformed wilds, synchronized reels, and sticky wilds that are triggered by landing a wild symbol on the 3 central reels. Players can earn a respin with each additional wild that triggers another spin. The Mayan Wild feature can increase the win multiplier by 1x with the landing of every third wild. The Mystery Wild and Mystery Sync features can be triggered at random on any spin.\n\nScenery and graphics\n\nMayan Magic Wildfire is set within a colorful jungle scene with lush graphics and rich colors. The game window appears to be suspended on a stone structure with a green gem at its center. The cascading waterfall in the background adds to the overall atmosphere. The design is comic-style and works well with the game's theme.\n\nMaya Wilds Feature\n\nThe Maya Wilds Feature provides players with a respin when a wild symbol lands on any position on the 3 central reels. Additional wilds earn more respins and sticky wilds are added to the central position on that reel. Every third wild that lands increases the win multiplier by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild and Mystery Sync Features\n\nThe Mystery Wild Feature is triggered at random on any spin. The symbol on the central position of reel 3 transforms into a wild, along with all instances of that symbol elsewhere on the central position of the 3 reels. The Maya Wild feature follows. The Mystery Sync feature can also be triggered at random on any spin. The symbols on the 3 central reels synchronize to create a new winning combination.\n\nEstimated RTP and payouts\n\nThe estimated RTP of this medium variance game is around 96%. The chance to win up to 1,264 times the player's stake is available with the Mayan Magic Wildfire slot.\n\nComparison to other similar jungle-themed online slot games\n\nMayan Magic Wildfire is a jungle-themed online slot game that offers a unique set of wild features. For those interested in similar jungle-themed slots, Jumanji is a good option to try. For those interested in mega jackpots, Mega Moolah is popular; the jackpot offers the chance for players to win millions of euros with a single spin.\n\n        \n            ",

The game features wilds which trigger the action and provide respins with sticky wilds added to the central position of the reel. The game also has transformed wilds and synchronized reels which increase the potential for winning.\n\nVisuals and Sound\n\nMayan Magic Wildfire's graphics are natural and elaborately detailed. The game's colors and graphics are inspired by the Mayan civilization, and the game is set in the midst of a jungle scene with a cascading waterfall in the background. The game's borderless window suspends seemingly on a stone structure with a green gem at the center which plays a fundamental role in one of the game's features. Additionally, the graphics are accompanied by a tribal sound, which sets a suspenseful ambiance.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nThe game offers players a medium variance, and the RTP has not yet been confirmed, but it is estimated to be around 96%. The game has a decent multiplier of 1,264x your stake, and the paylines pay in both directions, which increases your chances of winning.\n\nMayan Wilds Feature\n\nThe Mayan Wilds Feature awards a respin when a wild appears in any position on the three central reels. The feature then adds a Sticky wild to the center position of that reel with every wild that lands during the spin adding another spin to the total. After every third wild that hits, the multiplier increases by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild Feature\n\nThe Mystery Wild Feature triggers randomly on any spin. The symbol in the central position of reel three transforms into a wild, and all other instances of that symbol on the central position of the three reels also become wild. The feature is then followed by the Mayan Wilds Feature.\n\nMystery Sync Feature\n\nThe Mystery Sync Feature can be triggered randomly on any spin. The symbols on the three central reels synchronize to create a new winning combination, making it more likely for players to hit big wins, especially since the paylines pay in both directions.\n\nComparison to Similar Games\n\nMayan Magic Wildfire is a colorful Nolimit City online slot that offers players various smart wild features along with paylines that pay in both directions. It has a comic-style design, and players can hear the sound of the waterfall and the rainforest's noises while spinning. If you're a fan of jungle-themed online slots, you might also enjoy Jumanji. \n\n        \n            ",

The wilds are the key to the action in this rainforest adventure. Land 1 on 3 central reels and earn a respin, complete with a sticky wild. Also on offer are transformed wilds and synchronized reels. Play on all devices from €0.10 to €10 per spin. \n\nNatural graphics:\nMayan Magic Wildfire is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 10 fixed lines, paying in both directions from left to right and right to left. Your expedition into Maya territory on desktop or mobile starts at 0.10 credits and reaches a peak of 100 credits per spin. The RTP of this medium variance game has not yet been confirmed, but it is estimated to be around 96%.\n\nOpen the game to find yourself in the midst of a lush jungle scene with a waterfall in the background. The game window without borders seems to be suspended on a stone structure that has a green gem at its center, which will play a fundamental role in one of the features. Elaborate graphics and rich colors dominate the reels along with a tribal soundtrack that increases suspense. \n\nThe long-standing Maya civilization provides the theme for this colorful Nolimit City online slot; it is called Mayan Magic Wildfire and offers players various smart wild features along with paylines that pay in both directions. Mayan Magic Wildfire is a five-reel slot with three rows and ten fixed paylines that pay in both directions, so the number is actually doubled. The reels spin in front of a cascading waterfall flanked by dense jungle, and the game is accompanied by delicate tribal sounds. Two members of the royal family, the priest, jaguar, and serpent represent the high-value symbols, while gold-plated jewels in red, purple, blue, and green make up the lower values.\n\nSlot machine functions and symbols:\nMaya Wilds Feature: This feature becomes active when you land a Wild in any position on the 3 central reels. A respin is awarded with a Sticky wild added to the central position on that reel. More wilds mean more respins. For example, if you landed 3 wilds on the trigger spin, you would receive 3 respins. Every wild that lands during the spin adds another spin to the total. After every third wild hits a multiplier increases by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild Feature: This can trigger at random on any spin. The symbol on the central position of reel 3 transforms into a wild. All instances of that symbol elsewhere on the central position of the 3 reels also become wild. The Maya Wild feature then follows.\n\nMystery Sync Feature: This can also be triggered at random on any spin. The symbols on the 3 central reels synchronize to create, hopefully, a new winning combination.\n\nThe design here is comic-style and works well. You'll hear the sound of the waterfall, the rainforest's noises, and the pipes from the background as you spin.\n\nThe range of features offered in Mayan Magic Wildfire is not extensive. However, the wild appearances can give some decent action, especially if you get involved with the Mayan Wilds and move the multiplier in the right direction - for a total of 1,264 times your stake.\n\nThe Mayan Wild triggers by landing a wild symbol anywhere on reels two, three, or four; the central position on reel three now becomes a Sticky wild, and you will receive one respin with each additional wild that triggers another spin. A wild landing on three increases the win multiplier by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild is a randomly triggered feature, and the symbol on the central position of reel three becomes wild along with any other instances of that symbol on reels two, three, and four.\n\nMystery Sync can also be triggered on any spin, and reels two, three, and four synchronize so that each row displays matching symbols, making it more likely for big wins to hit, especially since the paylines pay in both directions.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines:\nAre you a fan of jungle-themed online slots? You can try a spin on Jumanji.\n\nFor fans of mega, major, minor, and mini jackpots - Mega Moolah will be a good try. Damn, people have made millions of euros with a single spin on this game!\n            ",

The wilds are the key to the action in this rainforest adventure. Land 1 on 3 central reels and earn a respin, complete with a sticky wild. Also on offer are transformed wilds and synchronized reels. Play on all devices from €0.10 to €10 per spin. \n\nNatural graphics:\nMayan Magic Wildfire is a video slot with five reels, three rows, and 10 fixed lines, paying in both directions from left to right and right to left. Your expedition into Maya territory on desktop or mobile starts at 0.10 credits and reaches a peak of 100 credits per spin. The RTP of this medium variance game has not yet been confirmed, but it is estimated to be around 96%.\n\nOpen the game to find yourself in the midst of a lush jungle scene with a waterfall in the background. The game window without borders seems to be suspended on a stone structure that has a green gem at its center, which will play a fundamental role in one of the features. Elaborate graphics and rich colors dominate the reels along with a tribal soundtrack that increases suspense. \n\nThe long-standing Maya civilization provides the theme for this colorful Nolimit City online slot; it is called Mayan Magic Wildfire and offers players various smart wild features along with paylines that pay in both directions. Mayan Magic Wildfire is a five-reel slot with three rows and ten fixed paylines that pay in both directions, so the number is actually doubled. The reels spin in front of a cascading waterfall flanked by dense jungle, and the game is accompanied by delicate tribal sounds. Two members of the royal family, the priest, jaguar, and serpent represent the high-value symbols, while gold-plated jewels in red, purple, blue, and green make up the lower values.\n\nSlot machine functions and symbols:\nMaya Wilds Feature: This feature becomes active when you land a Wild in any position on the 3 central reels. A respin is awarded with a Sticky wild added to the central position on that reel. More wilds mean more respins. For example, if you landed 3 wilds on the trigger spin, you would receive 3 respins. Every wild that lands during the spin adds another spin to the total. After every third wild hits a multiplier increases by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild Feature: This can trigger at random on any spin. The symbol on the central position of reel 3 transforms into a wild. All instances of that symbol elsewhere on the central position of the 3 reels also become wild. The Maya Wild feature then follows.\n\nMystery Sync Feature: This can also be triggered at random on any spin. The symbols on the 3 central reels synchronize to create, hopefully, a new winning combination.\n\nThe design here is comic-style and works well. You'll hear the sound of the waterfall, the rainforest's noises, and the pipes from the background as you spin.\n\nThe range of features offered in Mayan Magic Wildfire is not extensive. However, the wild appearances can give some decent action, especially if you get involved with the Mayan Wilds and move the multiplier in the right direction - for a total of 1,264 times your stake.\n\nThe Mayan Wild triggers by landing a wild symbol anywhere on reels two, three, or four; the central position on reel three now becomes a Sticky wild, and you will receive one respin with each additional wild that triggers another spin. A wild landing on three increases the win multiplier by 1x.\n\nMystery Wild is a randomly triggered feature, and the symbol on the central position of reel three becomes wild along with any other instances of that symbol on reels two, three, and four.\n\nMystery Sync can also be triggered on any spin, and reels two, three, and four synchronize so that each row displays matching symbols, making it more likely for big wins to hit, especially since the paylines pay in both directions.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines:\nAre you a fan of jungle-themed online slots? You can try a spin on Jumanji.\n\nFor fans of mega, major, minor, and mini jackpots - Mega Moolah will be a good try. Damn, people have made millions of euros with a single spin on this game!\n        ",
