The music, with typical Christmas sounds and instruments, makes the atmosphere even more enjoyable.\nThe symbols in the Book of Santa slot include the inevitable Santa Claus, his sleigh, stars, bells, and the game's protagonist: Santa's book (Book of Santa). This book contains all the addresses where gifts are to be delivered. Maybe yours is in there too?\nThe Book of Santa slot features a single special symbol that is very interesting and also activates the free spins feature - the only special feature of the game. This special symbol is Santa's book, which is both a scatter and a wild symbol. In addition to substituting for all other symbols in the game to create winning combinations, it also pays out every time it appears in 3 or more points in a single spin.\nBy displaying 3 or more book symbols in a single spin, 10 free spins with a special expandable symbol are activated. At the beginning of the free spins, a symbol is randomly selected, which has the ability to expand across the entire reel where it appears.

Four cards are displayed on the screen, and if the player's selected card is higher than the dealer's card, the winnings are doubled. The average payout for this feature is 84%.\nOverall, the Book of Santa slot makes a great impression, especially for the atmosphere that the producers have managed to recreate. Playing it is very enjoyable, and the music (with some background wind) offers that extra touch (and if it's not liked, it can always be turned off). In terms of gameplay, the payouts are very interesting, and the wild & scatter symbol offers great satisfactions, especially during free spins, accompanied by the expandable symbols that can offer winning combinations in a much simpler way. The theoretical average payout for the Book of Santa slot is 96%, which is rather high. The minimum bet is €0.01 and the maximum is €100 per spin.\n            ",

The music, with typical Christmas sounds and instruments, makes the atmosphere even more enjoyable.\nThe symbols in the Book of Santa slot include the inevitable Santa Claus, his sleigh, stars, bells, and the game's protagonist: Santa's book (Book of Santa). This book contains all the addresses where gifts are to be delivered. Maybe yours is in there too?\nThe Book of Santa slot features a single special symbol that is very interesting and also activates the free spins feature - the only special feature of the game. This special symbol is Santa's book, which is both a scatter and a wild symbol. In addition to substituting for all other symbols in the game to create winning combinations, it also pays out every time it appears in 3 or more points in a single spin.\nBy displaying 3 or more book symbols in a single spin, 10 free spins with a special expandable symbol are activated. At the beginning of the free spins, a symbol is randomly selected, which has the ability to expand across the entire reel where it appears. Additional free spins can be won during the feature.\nAt the end of each winning spin, the \"Gamble\" feature can be activated to double the winnings up to 10 times, with a high card game. Four cards are displayed on the screen, and if the player's selected card is higher than the dealer's card, the winnings are doubled. The average payout for this feature is 84%.\nOverall, the Book of Santa slot makes a great impression, especially for the atmosphere that the producers have managed to recreate. Playing it is very enjoyable, and the music (with some background wind) offers that extra touch (and if it's not liked, it can always be turned off). In terms of gameplay, the payouts are very interesting, and the wild & scatter symbol offers great satisfactions, especially during free spins, accompanied by the expandable symbols that can offer winning combinations in a much simpler way. The theoretical average payout for the Book of Santa slot is 96%, which is rather high. The minimum bet is €0.01 and the maximum is €100 per spin.\n            ",
