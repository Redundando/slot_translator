It features an unusual circular reel system that creates winning combinations by landing corresponding symbols from the outer circle, through the center, and even from the other side. With cascading reels after every successful spin, players can also trigger the Free Spins feature where wild multipliers can go up to 300x. Discover all the things you need to know about this unusual slot game in our in-depth review of Hypernova Radial Reels.\n\nPreviously known as Chance Interactive, ReelPlay is an Australian developer based in Sydney, founded in 2014. Thus far, ReelPlay has not made much noise yet and its portfolio is still quite limited, although two of their titles - Buster Hammer and Buster Hammer Carnival - have gained some recognition in the casino community.\n\nExperience Innovative Circular Reels with Hypernova Megaways\n\nHypernova Megaways is ReelPlay's first attempt at creating a Megaways slot game. Although it may seem like just another Bonanza clone at first glance, there are enough differences to make it stand out. With cascading reels and up to 117,649 ways to win on its 6 reels, Hypernova Megaways takes players on an intergalactic journey with stunning visuals and a fantastic soundtrack. This game can be played on all devices with a wager range of €0.40 to €60 per spin, making it a perfect choice for both novice and experienced players.\n\nThe reels of Hypernova Megaways feature 10 precious gemstone symbols set against the backdrop of a deep space universe. The most rewarding symbol is the pink diamond, which rewards players with up to 33.33x their bet on a payline. The design and theme of the game create a futuristic atmosphere that is perfectly complemented by an electronic soundtrack that could have been pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.\n\nSpecial Features and Symbols\n\nThe shining purple globe serves as the scatter symbol in Hypernova Megaways. Landing 3, 4, 5, or 6 purple globes will award players with prizes of 2x, 10x, 25x, or 50x their total bet, respectively. Landing 3 or more purple globes on reels 1 to 6 on the right side of the reels will trigger the Free Spins feature, which awards players with 4 free spins. Winning combinations that include a wild symbol come with attached multipliers that start at 1x and increase by 1 with every scatter symbol that appears.\n\nThe more scatter symbols that players collect during Free Spins, the larger the multipliers will be, with a maximum multiplier of 300x possible by collecting 12 or more scatter symbols during the bonus round. This also means players could potentially earn up to 52 extra free spins. Once the 300x multiplier is reached, no more scatter symbols will appear and no more free spins can be triggered.\n\nIf players land 2 different sets of scatter symbols on 6 different reels during the base game, they can trigger 2 batches of free spins that will be played one after the other.\n\nIn Hypernova Radial Reels, players will encounter a three-ring circular machine with 12 paylines. To create a winning combination, players must land 3 or more matching symbols in a line from the outer ring to the center position. Matching symbols can also pass through the center and come out the other side, creating winning combinations of up to 6 symbols.\n\nHypernova Radial Reels can be played with bets ranging from €0.12 to €120 per spin. Autoplay is available with 5 to 100 auto spins possible. However, there are no stop-loss or stop-win limits available, nor a Quickspin mode.\n\nWith a standard game RTP of 96.26%, the RTP increases to 97.3% when players purchase the bonus feature. The action in Hypernova Radial Reels is explosive and immersive, making it an ideal game for experienced gamblers looking for something new and exciting.\n\nSimilar Slot Games\n\nFor another slot game that uses circular reels, Yggdrasil Gaming's Avatar: Gateway Guardians may be worth checking out.

Cascades follow every successful spin. There's also a Free Spins feature where wild multipliers can go up to 300x. Discover everything you need to know about this rather unusual slot in our in-depth review of Hypernova Radial Reels.\n\nPreviously known as Chance Interactive, ReelPlay is an Australian developer based in Sydney, founded in 2014. So far, ReelPlay hasn't made much noise and the portfolio is still rather limited, although two of their titles, Buster Hammer and Buster Hammer Carnival, have garnered some recognition in the casino community.\n\nVisually, Hypernova Radial Reels takes you on an intergalactic journey far beyond the Earth's borders. With a beautiful soundtrack that could have been composed by Hans Zimmer himself, the reels are set inside a supernova and illuminated by neon lights. The most rewarding symbol is the diamond, which will give you 10 times your stake for six on a payline.\n\nThere is a slightly futuristic atmosphere in the design of the Hypernova Radial Reels slot machine. The symbols are beautiful and sharp on the dark background. It is simple, but it works well. The same goes for the electronic soundtrack that could come from a science fiction movie. It's fairly sober, but it fits the theme very well.\n\nOn a deep background, the reel rings consist of 10 brightly colored gemstone symbols. The most rewarding is the pink diamond which rewards up to 33.33x your bet per payline.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe glittering purple globe is the scatter symbol. Land 3, 4, 5 or 6 purple spheres and you'll win a prize of 2, 10, 25 or 50 times your total bet. Hit 3 or more purple spheres on lines 1 to 6 on the right side of the reels and you'll trigger the Free Spins feature.\n\nYour reward is 4 free spins. Wins that include a wild come with an attached multiplier. The wild multiplier starts at 1x but increases by 1 each time a scatter symbol appears. The number of free spins also resets to 4.\n\nThe more scatters you collect during the round, the bigger the multipliers. These can become very large, with a maximum multiplier of 300x if you manage to collect 12 or more scatters during the round. This also means lots of potential extra free spins - up to 52 in total. Once the 300x multiplier is reached, scatter symbols will no longer appear, so no more free spins.\n\nYou can make 2 sets of free spins from the same base spin if you get 2 different sets of scatters on 6 different reels. These are played one after the other.\n\nThe Hypernova Radial Reels slot is played on a machine consisting of 3 concentric circles and a central position. To create a winning combination, you need to land 3 or more matching symbols in a line from the outer ring to the center position.\n\nMatching symbols can pass through the center and come out on the other side, allowing for winning combinations ranging from a minimum of 3 to 6 symbols. There are 12 paylines here. The right side consists of lines 1 to 6 with the left half comprising lines 7 to 12.\n\nYou can play Hypernova Radial Reels at bet levels ranging from 12 cents to €120 per spin. Simply click on the coins beside the reels to adjust. Autoplay is also possible. If needed, you can run from 5 to 100 autoplay spins. There is no way to set stop limits for winning and losing, however, and there is no quickspin mode.\n\nThe Hypernova Radial Reels RTP is 96.26% in the standard game. If you buy the bonus, this increases to 97.3%. We found the action here to be quite explosive.\n\nOther similar slot machines include Avatar: Gateway Guardians by Yggdrasil Gaming. Playable from 10 cents to 40 euros per spin on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices, it rewards a win in the Hot Spot to get multipliers that can reach 101x. There is a Free Spins feature where you can play 10 free spins with up to 8 Hot Spots to get even more multipliers.",

                            "content": "Hypernova Radial Reels is a futuristic slot game powered by ReelPlay. It features a unique gameplay with circular reels that create winning combinations by landing matching symbols from the outer ring, through the center, and possibly from the other side. Cascades follow every successful spin. There's also a Free Spins feature where wild multipliers can go up to 300x. Discover everything you need to know about this rather unusual slot in our in-depth review of Hypernova Radial Reels.\n\nPreviously known as Chance Interactive, ReelPlay is an Australian developer based in Sydney, founded in 2014. So far, ReelPlay hasn't made much noise and the portfolio is still rather limited, although two of their titles, Buster Hammer and Buster Hammer Carnival, have garnered some recognition in the casino community.\n\nVisually, Hypernova Radial Reels takes you on an intergalactic journey far beyond the Earth's borders. With a beautiful soundtrack that could have been composed by Hans Zimmer himself, the reels are set inside a supernova and illuminated by neon lights. The most rewarding symbol is the diamond, which will give you 10 times your stake for six on a payline.\n\nThere is a slightly futuristic atmosphere in the design of the Hypernova Radial Reels slot machine. The symbols are beautiful and sharp on the dark background. It is simple, but it works well. The same goes for the electronic soundtrack that could come from a science fiction movie. It's fairly sober, but it fits the theme very well.\n\nOn a deep background, the reel rings consist of 10 brightly colored gemstone symbols. The most rewarding is the pink diamond which rewards up to 33.33x your bet per payline.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the slot machine\n\nThe glittering purple globe is the scatter symbol. Land 3, 4, 5 or 6 purple spheres and you'll win a prize of 2, 10, 25 or 50 times your total bet. Hit 3 or more purple spheres on lines 1 to 6 on the right side of the reels and you'll trigger the Free Spins feature.\n\nYour reward is 4 free spins. Wins that include a wild come with an attached multiplier. The wild multiplier starts at 1x but increases by 1 each time a scatter symbol appears. The number of free spins also resets to 4.\n\nThe more scatters you collect during the round, the bigger the multipliers. These can become very large, with a maximum multiplier of 300x if you manage to collect 12 or more scatters during the round. This also means lots of potential extra free spins - up to 52 in total. Once the 300x multiplier is reached, scatter symbols will no longer appear, so no more free spins.\n\nYou can make 2 sets of free spins from the same base spin if you get 2 different sets of scatters on 6 different reels. These are played one after the other.\n\nThe Hypernova Radial Reels slot is played on a machine consisting of 3 concentric circles and a central position. To create a winning combination, you need to land 3 or more matching symbols in a line from the outer ring to the center position.\n\nMatching symbols can pass through the center and come out on the other side, allowing for winning combinations ranging from a minimum of 3 to 6 symbols. There are 12 paylines here. The right side consists of lines 1 to 6 with the left half comprising lines 7 to 12.\n\nYou can play Hypernova Radial Reels at bet levels ranging from 12 cents to €120 per spin. Simply click on the coins beside the reels to adjust. Autoplay is also possible. If needed, you can run from 5 to 100 autoplay spins. There is no way to set stop limits for winning and losing, however, and there is no quickspin mode.\n\nThe Hypernova Radial Reels RTP is 96.26% in the standard game. If you buy the bonus, this increases to 97.3%. We found the action here to be quite explosive.\n\nOther similar slot machines include Avatar: Gateway Guardians by Yggdrasil Gaming. Playable from 10 cents to 40 euros per spin on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices, it rewards a win in the Hot Spot to get multipliers that can reach 101x. There is a Free Spins feature where you can play 10 free spins with up to 8 Hot Spots to get even more multipliers."

It features an unusual circular reel system that creates winning combinations by landing corresponding symbols from the outer circle, through the center, and even from the other side. With cascading reels after every successful spin, players can also trigger the Free Spins feature where wild multipliers can go up to 300x. Discover all the things you need to know about this unusual slot game in our in-depth review of Hypernova Radial Reels.\n\nPreviously known as Chance Interactive, ReelPlay is an Australian developer based in Sydney, founded in 2014. Thus far, ReelPlay has not made much noise yet and its portfolio is still quite limited, although two of their titles - Buster Hammer and Buster Hammer Carnival - have gained some recognition in the casino community.\n\nExperience Innovative Circular Reels with Hypernova Megaways\n\nHypernova Megaways is ReelPlay's first attempt at creating a Megaways slot game. Although it may seem like just another Bonanza clone at first glance, there are enough differences to make it stand out. With cascading reels and up to 117,649 ways to win on its 6 reels, Hypernova Megaways takes players on an intergalactic journey with stunning visuals and a fantastic soundtrack. This game can be played on all devices with a wager range of €0.40 to €60 per spin, making it a perfect choice for both novice and experienced players.\n\nThe reels of Hypernova Megaways feature 10 precious gemstone symbols set against the backdrop of a deep space universe. The most rewarding symbol is the pink diamond, which rewards players with up to 33.33x their bet on a payline. The design and theme of the game create a futuristic atmosphere that is perfectly complemented by an electronic soundtrack that could have been pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.\n\nSpecial Features and Symbols\n\nThe shining purple globe serves as the scatter symbol in Hypernova Megaways. Landing 3, 4, 5, or 6 purple globes will award players with prizes of 2x, 10x, 25x, or 50x their total bet, respectively. Landing 3 or more purple globes on reels 1 to 6 on the right side of the reels will trigger the Free Spins feature, which awards players with 4 free spins. Winning combinations that include a wild symbol come with attached multipliers that start at 1x and increase by 1 with every scatter symbol that appears.\n\nThe more scatter symbols that players collect during Free Spins, the larger the multipliers will be, with a maximum multiplier of 300x possible by collecting 12 or more scatter symbols during the bonus round. This also means players could potentially earn up to 52 extra free spins. Once the 300x multiplier is reached, no more scatter symbols will appear and no more free spins can be triggered.\n\nIf players land 2 different sets of scatter symbols on 6 different reels during the base game, they can trigger 2 batches of free spins that will be played one after the other.\n\nIn Hypernova Radial Reels, players will encounter a three-ring circular machine with 12 paylines. To create a winning combination, players must land 3 or more matching symbols in a line from the outer ring to the center position. Matching symbols can also pass through the center and come out the other side, creating winning combinations of up to 6 symbols.\n\nHypernova Radial Reels can be played with bets ranging from €0.12 to €120 per spin. Autoplay is available with 5 to 100 auto spins possible. However, there are no stop-loss or stop-win limits available, nor a Quickspin mode.\n\nWith a standard game RTP of 96.26%, the RTP increases to 97.3% when players purchase the bonus feature. The action in Hypernova Radial Reels is explosive and immersive, making it an ideal game for experienced gamblers looking for something new and exciting.\n\nSimilar Slot Games\n\nFor another slot game that uses circular reels, Yggdrasil Gaming's Avatar: Gateway Guardians may be worth checking out. With a wager range of €0.10 to €40 per spin, and features such as Hot Spots and multipliers that can reach up to 101x, players can also trigger the Free Spins feature that awards 10 free spins with up to 8 Hot Spots for more multipliers.\n            ",

The three-ring circular machine has 12 paylines.\n\nCascading reels\n\nAfter every successful spin, the cascading reels feature is activated, giving players a chance to create additional winning combinations with every new symbol fall. \n\nFree Spins feature\n\nLanding 3 or more scatter symbols on reels 1 to 6 on the right side of the reels will trigger the Free Spins feature, which awards players with 4 free spins. Winning combinations that include a wild symbol come with attached multipliers that start at 1x and increase by 1 with every scatter symbol that appears. The more scatter symbols that players collect during Free Spins, the larger the multipliers will be, with a maximum multiplier of 300x possible by collecting 12 or more scatter symbols during the bonus round. This also means players could potentially earn up to 52 extra free spins. Once the 300x multiplier is reached, no more scatter symbols will appear and no more free spins can be triggered. If players land 2 different sets of scatter symbols on 6 different reels during the base game, they can trigger 2 batches of free spins. \n\nWild multipliers\n\nThe game offers wild multipliers that start at 1x and increase by 1 with every scatter symbol that appears, which can go up to 300x during the Free Spins feature. \n\nGameplay mechanics\n\nHypernova Radial Reels can be played with bets ranging from €0.12 to €120 per spin. Autoplay is available with 5 to 100 auto spins possible. However, there are no stop-loss or stop-win limits available, nor a Quickspin mode. With a standard game RTP of 96.26%, the RTP increases to 97.3% when players purchase the bonus feature.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nHypernova Megaways features 10 precious gemstone symbols that create a futuristic atmosphere that is perfectly complemented by an electronic soundtrack that could have been pulled straight from a sci-fi movie. The visuals are stunning and the design is top-notch.\n\nProvider (ReelPlay)\n\nReelPlay, an Australian developer founded in 2014 that was previously known as Chance Interactive, created Hypernova Megaways. The developer has not made much noise yet and its portfolio is still quite limited, although two of their titles - Buster Hammer and Buster Hammer Carnival - have gained some recognition in the casino community. \n\n        \n            ",

It features an unusual circular reel system that creates winning combinations by landing corresponding symbols from the outer circle, through the center, and even from the other side. With cascading reels after every successful spin, players can also trigger the Free Spins feature where wild multipliers can go up to 300x. Discover all the things you need to know about this unusual slot game in our in-depth review of Hypernova Radial Reels.\n\nPreviously known as Chance Interactive, ReelPlay is an Australian developer based in Sydney, founded in 2014. Thus far, ReelPlay has not made much noise yet and its portfolio is still quite limited, although two of their titles - Buster Hammer and Buster Hammer Carnival - have gained some recognition in the casino community.\n\nExperience Innovative Circular Reels with Hypernova Megaways\n\nHypernova Megaways is ReelPlay's first attempt at creating a Megaways slot game. Although it may seem like just another Bonanza clone at first glance, there are enough differences to make it stand out. With cascading reels and up to 117,649 ways to win on its 6 reels, Hypernova Megaways takes players on an intergalactic journey with stunning visuals and a fantastic soundtrack. This game can be played on all devices with a wager range of €0.40 to €60 per spin, making it a perfect choice for both novice and experienced players.\n\nThe reels of Hypernova Megaways feature 10 precious gemstone symbols set against the backdrop of a deep space universe. The most rewarding symbol is the pink diamond, which rewards players with up to 33.33x their bet on a payline. The design and theme of the game create a futuristic atmosphere that is perfectly complemented by an electronic soundtrack that could have been pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.\n\nSpecial Features and Symbols\n\nThe shining purple globe serves as the scatter symbol in Hypernova Megaways. Landing 3, 4, 5, or 6 purple globes will award players with prizes of 2x, 10x, 25x, or 50x their total bet, respectively. Landing 3 or more purple globes on reels 1 to 6 on the right side of the reels will trigger the Free Spins feature, which awards players with 4 free spins. Winning combinations that include a wild symbol come with attached multipliers that start at 1x and increase by 1 with every scatter symbol that appears.\n\nThe more scatter symbols that players collect during Free Spins, the larger the multipliers will be, with a maximum multiplier of 300x possible by collecting 12 or more scatter symbols during the bonus round. This also means players could potentially earn up to 52 extra free spins. Once the 300x multiplier is reached, no more scatter symbols will appear and no more free spins can be triggered.\n\nIf players land 2 different sets of scatter symbols on 6 different reels during the base game, they can trigger 2 batches of free spins that will be played one after the other.\n\nIn Hypernova Radial Reels, players will encounter a three-ring circular machine with 12 paylines. To create a winning combination, players must land 3 or more matching symbols in a line from the outer ring to the center position. Matching symbols can also pass through the center and come out the other side, creating winning combinations of up to 6 symbols.\n\nHypernova Radial Reels can be played with bets ranging from €0.12 to €120 per spin. Autoplay is available with 5 to 100 auto spins possible. However, there are no stop-loss or stop-win limits available, nor a Quickspin mode.\n\nWith a standard game RTP of 96.26%, the RTP increases to 97.3% when players purchase the bonus feature. The action in Hypernova Radial Reels is explosive and immersive, making it an ideal game for experienced gamblers looking for something new and exciting.\n\nSimilar Slot Games\n\nFor another slot game that uses circular reels, Yggdrasil Gaming's Avatar: Gateway Guardians may be worth checking out. With a wager range of €0.10 to €40 per spin, and features such as Hot Spots and multipliers that can reach up to 101x, players can also trigger the Free Spins feature that awards 10 free spins with up to 8 Hot Spots for more multipliers.\n            ",

It features an unusual circular reel system that creates winning combinations by landing corresponding symbols from the outer circle, through the center, and even from the other side. With cascading reels after every successful spin, players can also trigger the Free Spins feature where wild multipliers can go up to 300x. Discover all the things you need to know about this unusual slot game in our in-depth review of Hypernova Radial Reels.\n\nPreviously known as Chance Interactive, ReelPlay is an Australian developer based in Sydney, founded in 2014. Thus far, ReelPlay has not made much noise yet and its portfolio is still quite limited, although two of their titles - Buster Hammer and Buster Hammer Carnival - have gained some recognition in the casino community.\n\nExperience Innovative Circular Reels with Hypernova Megaways\n\nHypernova Megaways is ReelPlay's first attempt at creating a Megaways slot game. Although it may seem like just another Bonanza clone at first glance, there are enough differences to make it stand out. With cascading reels and up to 117,649 ways to win on its 6 reels, Hypernova Megaways takes players on an intergalactic journey with stunning visuals and a fantastic soundtrack. This game can be played on all devices with a wager range of €0.40 to €60 per spin, making it a perfect choice for both novice and experienced players.\n\nThe reels of Hypernova Megaways feature 10 precious gemstone symbols set against the backdrop of a deep space universe. The most rewarding symbol is the pink diamond, which rewards players with up to 33.33x their bet on a payline. The design and theme of the game create a futuristic atmosphere that is perfectly complemented by an electronic soundtrack that could have been pulled straight from a sci-fi movie.\n\nSpecial Features and Symbols\n\nThe shining purple globe serves as the scatter symbol in Hypernova Megaways. Landing 3, 4, 5, or 6 purple globes will award players with prizes of 2x, 10x, 25x, or 50x their total bet, respectively. Landing 3 or more purple globes on reels 1 to 6 on the right side of the reels will trigger the Free Spins feature, which awards players with 4 free spins. Winning combinations that include a wild symbol come with attached multipliers that start at 1x and increase by 1 with every scatter symbol that appears.\n\nThe more scatter symbols that players collect during Free Spins, the larger the multipliers will be, with a maximum multiplier of 300x possible by collecting 12 or more scatter symbols during the bonus round. This also means players could potentially earn up to 52 extra free spins. Once the 300x multiplier is reached, no more scatter symbols will appear and no more free spins can be triggered.\n\nIf players land 2 different sets of scatter symbols on 6 different reels during the base game, they can trigger 2 batches of free spins that will be played one after the other.\n\nIn Hypernova Radial Reels, players will encounter a three-ring circular machine with 12 paylines. To create a winning combination, players must land 3 or more matching symbols in a line from the outer ring to the center position. Matching symbols can also pass through the center and come out the other side, creating winning combinations of up to 6 symbols.\n\nHypernova Radial Reels can be played with bets ranging from €0.12 to €120 per spin. Autoplay is available with 5 to 100 auto spins possible. However, there are no stop-loss or stop-win limits available, nor a Quickspin mode.\n\nWith a standard game RTP of 96.26%, the RTP increases to 97.3% when players purchase the bonus feature. The action in Hypernova Radial Reels is explosive and immersive, making it an ideal game for experienced gamblers looking for something new and exciting.\n\nSimilar Slot Games\n\nFor another slot game that uses circular reels, Yggdrasil Gaming's Avatar: Gateway Guardians may be worth checking out. With a wager range of €0.10 to €40 per spin, and features such as Hot Spots and multipliers that can reach up to 101x, players can also trigger the Free Spins feature that awards 10 free spins with up to 8 Hot Spots for more multipliers.\n            ",
