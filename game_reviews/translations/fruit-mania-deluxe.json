This game developer specializes in all genres of video slots. Fruit Mania Deluxe may seem like a classic slot with traditional characters at first glance, but on closer inspection, players will discover modern bonuses that can increase their bankroll with every round. \n\nThe original design of the video slot is worth noting. The game is set as a TV show, with bright spotlights and electric torches. The interface is bright and positive, and all details, including the three reels and one payline, are displayed in high quality. The 3D graphics are state-of-the-art, except for the realistic and voluminous characters that are presented in 2D. A large logo with bright lanterns is located above the game field, along with indicators that show which bonus is activated.\n\nThe control panel is free of complex options, but players can adjust the payment amount for future prospects using the Coin Value button. The big, bright button allows for single rotations, but players can use Autoplay for continuous rotation. Before beginning, players should check the paytable to understand the symbols and their values.\n\nDuring each non-winning spin, two or three matching symbols that could form the most valuable winning combination are locked. However, the next spin that requires payment may lead to a victory. The game uses a 3x3 grid, and at least four symbols of the same type need to be placed on the playfield to create a winning combination.\n\nPlayers can choose to bet on a coin value ranging from $0.01 to $10 and bet between $0.10 and $100 per spin. The game offers an Autoplay option that enables up to 1,000 consecutive uninterrupted spins. After each winning round, players can use the Gamble option to double their winnings. The game also allows players to adjust the speed and volatility according to their preferences.\n\nFruit Mania Deluxe offers unique bonuses that make it stand out even among classic slots. Collect nine red diamonds in the bonus table, and the next time you land at least three red diamonds anywhere on the reels, you will receive nine free spins. During these rounds, trigger symbols stay in place, and collecting four or more will result in additional payments based on the paytable.\n\nIf you manage to land three Lotto symbols on the central reel, you will activate the Lotto Bonus. Choose one of the three tickets and reveal an instant prize of 1,000, 4,000, or 10,000 coins.\n\nIf you are a fan of traditional slot machines, Fruit Mania Deluxe is the perfect game for you. However, if you are looking for something new, we recommend Reel Rush, which offers the novelty of cube-shaped fruit and an incredible 3,125 paylines.",

This is a false assumption, especially if the video slot was created by Wazdan. This manufacturer specializes in all genres of video slots. At first glance, Fruit Mania Deluxe appears as a representative of “old school” slots with a set of traditional characters. First, it is necessary to familiarize oneself with the game model more closely and place a bet. Afterwards, the winnings increase your bankroll in each round. To remove all doubts, the developers have added some modern bonuses!\n\nA traditional graphics\n\nIt is worth noting the original design of the video slot. So, the game is framed in the form of a television show, as evidenced by the bright spotlights and electric torches. In general, the interface is bright and positive. all the details including the 3 reels and 1 payline, have been represented qualitatively, so participants can immerse themselves in the atmosphere of a popular television show, in just seconds. To make the slot machine complete, its authors have also added a rhythmic melody that accompanies the user in every spin. Attention is drawn to the cutting-edge 3D graphics. all the elements, except for the realistic and voluminous characters, are presented in 2D format, after all, Fruit Mania Deluxe is an “old school” slot. For this reason, modern technology has been moderately used. A large logo with glowing lanterns is located above the playing field and hints.\n\nBy the way, the field with hints has been moved to the main screen, so there is no need to look for it in the theoretical section. This is convenient, as the participant always knows which bonus is activated. The control panel is devoid of complex options. It is logical that it is not possible to change the number of active lines. But at the same time, it is possible to determine the magnitude of future payouts using the rate set by the Coin Value button. The large bright button makes single spins, but with the help of Autoplay you can enjoy auto spins. Remember to visit the paytable first.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nAt every non-winning spin, two or three corresponding symbols that can form the most valuable winning combination are locked. However, the next spin that may lead to a win will have to be paid for.\n\nThe slot uses a 3x3 grid. To create a winning combo, it is necessary to place at least four symbols of one type on the playing field.\n\nBefore starting the reels, choose a coin value from a range starting from 0.01$ and going up to 10$. You can bet between $0.10 and $100 per spin, which is a betting interval suitable for both beginners and experienced gamblers.\n\nThe game is equipped with the Autoplay option which allows to activate up to 1,000 uninterrupted spins.\n\nAfter each winning spin, it is possible to use the Gamble option and try to double your winnings.\n\nThe game also allows you to adjust the speed and volatility according to your preferences.\n\nCollect 9 red diamonds in the Diamond Bonus Matrix Table, and the next time you land at least 3 red diamonds anywhere on the reels, you will receive 9 free spins. During the free games, the trigger symbols are held in their positions, and if you collect a total of 4 or more, they will pay out according to the paytable in addition to your winnings.\n\nLand 3 Lotto symbols on the middle reel to activate the Lotto Bonus. Choose one of the three tickets and reveal an instant prize of either 1,000, 4,000 or 10,000 coins.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\n\nWe know you are a fan of traditional Slot Machines, which is why you chose to bet your money on Fruit Mania Deluxe. If you want to try something new, with fruit cubes instead, we can recommend Reel Rush, with its incredible number of 3,125 paylines.\n            ",

To create a winning combination, at least four symbols of the same type have to appear on the reel. The slot game uses a 3x3 grid, and every non-winning spin locks two or three corresponding symbols that may lead to the most valuable winning combination. It is possible to choose a coin value from a range of 0.01$ to 10$. The Autoplay option allows the player to activate up to 1,000 uninterrupted spins. After each winning spin, players can use the Gamble option to try to double their winnings. The game also allows players to adjust the speed and volatility to their preference. To activate free spins, players need to collect 9 red diamonds in the Diamond Bonus Matrix Table. Once they collect the diamonds, they will receive 9 free spins the next time they land 3 red diamonds anywhere on the reels. Players can also activate the Lotto Bonus by landing 3 Lotto symbols on the middle reel. Choosing one of the three tickets will reveal an instant prize of either 1,000, 4,000, or 10,000 coins.\n\nVisual and Audio Design\n\nFruit Mania Deluxe has an original design, framed in the form of a television show with bright spotlights and electric torches. The interface is bright and positive with cutting-edge 3D graphics. The realistic and voluminous characters are presented in 2D format.

This is a false assumption, especially if the video slot was created by Wazdan. This manufacturer specializes in all genres of video slots. At first glance, Fruit Mania Deluxe appears as a representative of “old school” slots with a set of traditional characters. First, it is necessary to familiarize oneself with the game model more closely and place a bet. Afterwards, the winnings increase your bankroll in each round. To remove all doubts, the developers have added some modern bonuses!\n\nA traditional graphics\n\nIt is worth noting the original design of the video slot. So, the game is framed in the form of a television show, as evidenced by the bright spotlights and electric torches. In general, the interface is bright and positive. all the details including the 3 reels and 1 payline, have been represented qualitatively, so participants can immerse themselves in the atmosphere of a popular television show, in just seconds. To make the slot machine complete, its authors have also added a rhythmic melody that accompanies the user in every spin. Attention is drawn to the cutting-edge 3D graphics. all the elements, except for the realistic and voluminous characters, are presented in 2D format, after all, Fruit Mania Deluxe is an “old school” slot. For this reason, modern technology has been moderately used. A large logo with glowing lanterns is located above the playing field and hints.\n\nBy the way, the field with hints has been moved to the main screen, so there is no need to look for it in the theoretical section. This is convenient, as the participant always knows which bonus is activated. The control panel is devoid of complex options. It is logical that it is not possible to change the number of active lines. But at the same time, it is possible to determine the magnitude of future payouts using the rate set by the Coin Value button. The large bright button makes single spins, but with the help of Autoplay you can enjoy auto spins. Remember to visit the paytable first.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nAt every non-winning spin, two or three corresponding symbols that can form the most valuable winning combination are locked. However, the next spin that may lead to a win will have to be paid for.\n\nThe slot uses a 3x3 grid. To create a winning combo, it is necessary to place at least four symbols of one type on the playing field.\n\nBefore starting the reels, choose a coin value from a range starting from 0.01$ and going up to 10$. You can bet between $0.10 and $100 per spin, which is a betting interval suitable for both beginners and experienced gamblers.\n\nThe game is equipped with the Autoplay option which allows to activate up to 1,000 uninterrupted spins.\n\nAfter each winning spin, it is possible to use the Gamble option and try to double your winnings.\n\nThe game also allows you to adjust the speed and volatility according to your preferences.\n\nCollect 9 red diamonds in the Diamond Bonus Matrix Table, and the next time you land at least 3 red diamonds anywhere on the reels, you will receive 9 free spins. During the free games, the trigger symbols are held in their positions, and if you collect a total of 4 or more, they will pay out according to the paytable in addition to your winnings.\n\nLand 3 Lotto symbols on the middle reel to activate the Lotto Bonus. Choose one of the three tickets and reveal an instant prize of either 1,000, 4,000 or 10,000 coins.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\n\nWe know you are a fan of traditional Slot Machines, which is why you chose to bet your money on Fruit Mania Deluxe. If you want to try something new, with fruit cubes instead, we can recommend Reel Rush, with its incredible number of 3,125 paylines.\n        ",
