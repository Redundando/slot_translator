    "original_text": "\nFruit Supreme\nIl tema della frutta abbinato a una slot ha da sempre qualcosa di nostalgico, forse perché le arance, le ciliegie e le prugne erano i simboli che andavano per la maggiore quando ancora internet non esisteva e le slot erano soltanto delle macchinette fisiche a rotazione meccanica. Di certo c’è che il tema frutta ha continuato ad essere utilizzato anche dopo l’innovazione tecnologica, un omaggio alla tradizione che continua a riscuotere un enorme successo. La Playson con Fruit Supreme si infila in questo filone con una slot dalla grafica altamente realistica, al punto che mentre osserviamo i rulli ruotare ci viene quasi voglia di afferrare uno spicchio di arancia per addentarlo. Questo potrebbe dipendere anche dallo sfondo nero che fa risaltare i colori brillanti dei simboli. Nella parte bassa sotto la cornice sono presenti tutte le statistiche relative alla nostra giocata, le frecce per variare la scommessa e il tasto per impostare in un colpo solo la scommessa più alta. Gli altri tasti sono quello Start e quello per attivare i giri automatici.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLa griglia di gioco scelta dalla Playson ha 4 rulli e 3 righe, con 25 linee di pagamento fisse e combinazioni che risultano vincenti quando almeno 3 simboli si presentano in successione a partire da sinistra verso destra. La puntata minima è di 0,25 € (0,01 € per linea di pagamento), ma volendo si può innalzare la scommessa sino a un massimo di 100 €. È possibile impostare tra 5 e 999 giri automatici, con limite di perdita o di vincita singola, inoltre per chi volesse è disponibile la funzione Quick Spin che accelera la velocità di rotazione dei rulli. Un ulteriore punto a favore di questa slot è il valore RTP pari al 96,27% e una volatilità media, così da avere ottime vincite a fronte di una spesa contenuta.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nA differenza di tante altre slot, Fruit Supreme paga con 3 o 4 simboli. Inoltre, non sono presenti né Wild né Scatter, ma una bonus che – ne siamo certi – solleticherà il vostro interesse. Il simbolo di minor valore è la X. Tenendo conto della scommessa minima (0,25 €), con 4 simboli verremo ricompensati con 0,50 €, ma basterà innalzare la scommessa a 1 € per avere una vincita raddoppiata, pari a 2 €. Le ciliegie, l’arancia, il limone e la prugna, sempre tenendo conto della scommessa minima di 0,01 € per linea, pagano 1 €, mentre è con la scritta BAR che le cifre iniziano a farsi davvero interessanti. Con la puntata base, 4 simboli BAR in successione ci faranno vincere ben 10 €, la campanella 15 € e il numero sette (7), 40 €! Se avremo poi la fortuna di vedere 12 simboli identici, allora le nostre vincite verranno moltiplicate per 2!\n",

            "response": "Fruit Supreme\n\nThe fruit theme combined with a slot game has always had a nostalgic touch. Perhaps because oranges, cherries, and plums were the symbols that were most popular when the internet did not even exist yet and slots were merely physical machines with mechanical rotation. Surely enough, the fruit theme has continued to be used even after technological innovation, paying tribute to tradition and continuing to be highly successful. Playson, with Fruit Supreme, explores this theme with highly realistic graphics. Observing the reels rotate, we are almost tempted to grab a slice of orange to bite into. This could also be due to the black background that highlights the bright colors of the symbols. At the bottom of the frame are all the statistics related to our bet, arrows to vary the bet, and a button to set the highest bet in one go. The other buttons are Start and autospin.\n\nSlot features\nPlayson has chosen a game grid with 4 reels and 3 rows, with 25 fixed paylines and winning combinations when at least 3 symbols appear in succession from left to right. The minimum bet is €0.25 (€0.01 per payline), but you can increase the bet up to a maximum of €100. You can set between 5 and 999 autospins, with a limit on single loss or win. For those who want it, the Quick Spin function is available, speeding up the rotation of the reels. Another advantage of this slot is the RTP value, equal to 96.27%, and medium volatility, giving you excellent winnings at a moderate cost.\n\nSymbols and features\nUnlike many other slots, Fruit Supreme pays with 3 or 4 symbols. Moreover, there are no Wilds or Scatters, but there is a bonus that will surely pique your interest. The lowest value symbol is X. Taking into account the minimum bet (€0.25), with 4 symbols, we will be rewarded with €0.50, but simply raising the bet to €1, doubles the winnings to €2. Cherries, oranges, lemons, and plums, always taking into account the minimum bet of €0.01 per line, pay €1, while with the BAR sign, the figures become really interesting. With the base bet, 4 BAR symbols in succession will win us €10, a bell €15, and the number seven (7) €40! And if we are lucky enough to see 12 identical symbols, then our winnings will be multiplied by 2!",

Certainly, the fruit theme has continued to be used even after technological innovation, as tribute to the tradition that continues to garner enormous success. Playson's \"Fruit Supreme\" falls into this category with a highly realistic graphic slot, to the point that as we watch the reels spin, we almost want to grab a slice of orange to take a bite. This could also be due to the black background that highlights the bright colors of the symbols. At the bottom, beneath the frame, all statistics related to our game are present, along with the arrows to vary the bet and the button to set the highest bet in one go. The other buttons are the Start and the one to activate the automatic spins.\n\nSlot Features\n\nThe game grid chosen by Playson has four reels and three rows, with 25 fixed paylines, and winning combinations occur when at least three symbols appear in succession from left to right. The minimum bet is €0.25 (€0.01 per payline), but the bet can be raised up to a maximum of €100. It is possible to set between 5 and 999 automatic spins, with a single loss or win limit. Furthermore, for those who want it, the Quick Spin function is available, which accelerates the speed of the reel rotation. Another advantage of this slot is the RTP value of 96.27% and an average volatility, so you can have excellent winnings with a contained expense.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nUnlike many other slots, \"Fruit Supreme\" pays with 3 or 4 symbols. Also, there are no Wild or Scatter symbols, but there is a bonus that - we are sure - will pique your interest. The lowest value symbol is the X. Considering the minimum bet (€0.25), with 4 symbols, we will be rewarded with €0.50, but raising the bet to €1, we will have a doubled payout, equal to €2. Cherries, oranges, lemons, and plums, always considering a minimum bet of €0.01 per line, pay €1, while with the BAR symbol, the figures start to become really interesting. With the basic bet, 4 BAR symbols in succession will win us a whopping €10, the bell €15, and the number seven (7), €40! If we are lucky enough to see 12 identical symbols, then our winnings will be multiplied by 2!\n            ",

Certainly, the fruit theme has continued to be used even after technological innovation, as tribute to the tradition that continues to garner enormous success. Playson's \"Fruit Supreme\" falls into this category with a highly realistic graphic slot, to the point that as we watch the reels spin, we almost want to grab a slice of orange to take a bite. This could also be due to the black background that highlights the bright colors of the symbols. At the bottom, beneath the frame, all statistics related to our game are present, along with the arrows to vary the bet and the button to set the highest bet in one go. The other buttons are the Start and the one to activate the automatic spins.\n\nSlot Features\n\nThe game grid chosen by Playson has four reels and three rows, with 25 fixed paylines, and winning combinations occur when at least three symbols appear in succession from left to right. The minimum bet is €0.25 (€0.01 per payline), but the bet can be raised up to a maximum of €100. It is possible to set between 5 and 999 automatic spins, with a single loss or win limit.

Also, there are no Wild or Scatter symbols, but there is a bonus that - we are sure - will pique your interest. The lowest value symbol is the X. Considering the minimum bet (€0.25), with 4 symbols, we will be rewarded with €0.50, but raising the bet to €1, we will have a doubled payout, equal to €2. Cherries, oranges, lemons, and plums, always considering a minimum bet of €0.01 per line, pay €1, while with the BAR symbol, the figures start to become really interesting. With the basic bet, 4 BAR symbols in succession will win us a whopping €10, the bell €15, and the number seven (7), €40! If we are lucky enough to see 12 identical symbols, then our winnings will be multiplied by 2!\n            ",

            "prompt": "\n        Below is a review of the game \"Fruit Supreme\".\n\n        Please provide a detailed prompt for DALLE to create a feature image fitting the game\n        \n        - The image should be in cartoon style\n        - The should feature a happy Maya warrior with glasses\n\n        Review: \"Fruit Supreme\" Review\n\nThe fruit theme combined with a slot machine has always had a nostalgic feel to it, perhaps because oranges, cherries, and plums were the symbols that dominated when the internet did not exist and slots were only physical machines with mechanical rotation. Certainly, the fruit theme has continued to be used even after technological innovation, as tribute to the tradition that continues to garner enormous success. Playson's \"Fruit Supreme\" falls into this category with a highly realistic graphic slot, to the point that as we watch the reels spin, we almost want to grab a slice of orange to take a bite. This could also be due to the black background that highlights the bright colors of the symbols. At the bottom, beneath the frame, all statistics related to our game are present, along with the arrows to vary the bet and the button to set the highest bet in one go. The other buttons are the Start and the one to activate the automatic spins.\n\nSlot Features\n\nThe game grid chosen by Playson has four reels and three rows, with 25 fixed paylines, and winning combinations occur when at least three symbols appear in succession from left to right. The minimum bet is €0.25 (€0.01 per payline), but the bet can be raised up to a maximum of €100. It is possible to set between 5 and 999 automatic spins, with a single loss or win limit. Furthermore, for those who want it, the Quick Spin function is available, which accelerates the speed of the reel rotation. Another advantage of this slot is the RTP value of 96.27% and an average volatility, so you can have excellent winnings with a contained expense.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nUnlike many other slots, \"Fruit Supreme\" pays with 3 or 4 symbols. Also, there are no Wild or Scatter symbols, but there is a bonus that - we are sure - will pique your interest. The lowest value symbol is the X. Considering the minimum bet (€0.25), with 4 symbols, we will be rewarded with €0.50, but raising the bet to €1, we will have a doubled payout, equal to €2. Cherries, oranges, lemons, and plums, always considering a minimum bet of €0.01 per line, pay €1, while with the BAR symbol, the figures start to become really interesting. With the basic bet, 4 BAR symbols in succession will win us a whopping €10, the bell €15, and the number seven (7), €40! If we are lucky enough to see 12 identical symbols, then our winnings will be multiplied by 2!\n        ",
