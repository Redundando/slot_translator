Protagonista assoluto è, come detto, il potente figlio di Zeus ovvero Ercole, che intraprende alcune tra le sue più celebri avventure. Al suo fianco sono stati presentati simboli come le Mele d’oro, il mostro leggendario mostro della mitologia greca Idra, le classiche carte da gioco e il cane a tre teste.

Dovrai eliminarlo scegliendo tra le sue teste per vincere così i premi in denaro che sono nascosti al loro interno. Se hai fortuna in questa fase puoi sfruttare la funzione Hercules Rage che va a disintegrare tutte le teste di Idra in un colpo solo. Se riesci a raggiungere questo obiettivo Ercole ti porterà a effettuare una scelta finale: quella legata al moltiplicatore. In tal modo la tua vincita potrà aumentare esponenzialmente fino a 5x.\nNon dimentichiamo poi i giri gratis che si ottengono se appare il simbolo Scatter con la scritta Hercules sui rulli: potrai mettere mano su 10 giri gratuiti e un moltiplicatore 3x.

            "response": "Age of The Gods Prince of Olympus\nThe mythological theme returns, as does the Age of the Gods saga. Playtech's collaboration with Marvel has produced the online slot machine Age of the Gods: Prince of Olympus. This 5-reel, 25-payline slot offers not only exciting winning possibilities, but also a Progressive Jackpot. Four bonus features are included, which make this machine dedicated to the most famous of Greek gods versatile and lively.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the Hydra Bonus feature, which awards cash prizes with a maximum multiplier of 5x. The Hercules Rage function is undoubtedly the highlight of the game, exploding the Hydra's heads to release high sums. Also included are a maximum of 20 free spins, a 3x multiplier, and the Herculean Strength feature for re-spins during gameplay.\n\nGraphics and Symbols\nOnce again, the graphics are presented in a retro style, in line with classic land-based slot machines that can be found inside the casino. However, the storyline is full of animations and surprises that are worth trying. The absolute protagonist is, as mentioned, the powerful son of Zeus, Hercules, who embarks on some of his most famous adventures. Symbols such as Golden Apples, the legendary hydra monster of Greek mythology, classic playing cards, and the three-headed dog are also included. The latter has the highest value, with 4,000 times your bet if it appears 5 times on a payline.\n\nThe climax of the slot is the Hydra Bonus feature, which is triggered when the monster appears at the same time on reels 1 and 5. You must eliminate it by choosing from its heads to win the hidden cash prizes. If you're lucky, you can exploit the Hercules Rage feature, which disintegrates all the Hydra's heads in one shot. If you can achieve this goal, Hercules will lead you to make a final choice related to the multiplier. Your winnings can thus increase exponentially up to 5x.\n\nLet's not forget the free spins that are obtained if the Scatter symbol with the writing \"Hercules\" appears on the reels: you can get 10 free spins and a 3x multiplier. With three more Scatters, you can get up to 20 free spins and activate the Herculean Strength feature. Re-spins with an expanding Wild symbol, which is locked on the grid, will thus be activated.\n\nFinal thoughts on Age of the Gods: Prince of Olympus slot\nDo you want a final surprise (which may not be so surprising!)? As with all Age of the Gods slots, there are also 4 progressive jackpots that can be activated entirely at random. If you have a little more luck and the inevitable patience, you will be able to dream big and change your life forever with one of the best-structured slots.",

This 5-reel, 25-payline slot not only offers exciting opportunities to win, but also a Progressive Jackpot. With four bonus functions, this slot machine dedicated to the most famous Greek deity is versatile and lively.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the Hydra Bonus function, which awards cash prizes with a maximum 5x multiplier, but most importantly is the Hercules Rage function - it will make the Hydra's heads explode to release high sums. And not to forget, there is also a maximum of 20 free spins with a 3x multiplier and the Herculean Strength function, which offers re-spins during gameplay. \n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nGraphics are presented in a retro style, in line with classic land-based slot machines you can find in a casino. However, the story itself is rich in animations and plot twists that are worth exploring. The absolute protagonist is as mentioned, the powerful son of Zeus - Hercules - embarking on some of his most famous adventures. Alongside him, we have symbols such as Golden Apples, the legendary monster from Greek mythology - the Hydra, classic playing cards, and the three-headed dog. The latter symbol is the highest-valued, with 4,000 times the bet if it appears five times on a payline.\n\nThe highlight of the slot machine is the Hydra Bonus function, triggered when the monster appears on reels 1 and 5 simultaneously. You must choose between the Hydra's heads to eliminate and win the cash prizes hidden inside. If you're lucky in this phase, you can exploit the Hercules Rage function, which disintegrates all Hydra's heads in one go. If you manage to achieve this goal, Hercules will lead you to make a final decision - that related to the multiplier. In this way, your winnings can increase exponentially up to 5x.\n\nLet us not forget the free spins, which you can get if the Scatter symbol with \"Hercules\" appears on the reels. You can get your hands on 10 free spins and a 3x multiplier. With three more Scatters, you can get up to 20 free spins and activate the Herculean Strength function, which triggers re-spins with an expanding Wild that is locked onto the grid.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Age of the Gods: Prince of Olympus Slot\nWant a final surprise (which may not be a surprise at all!)? As with all slots in the Age of the Gods, there are also 4 random Progressive Jackpots. If you are lucky enough and have the patience required, you can dream big and change your life with one of the best-structured slot machines around.\n            ",

This 5-reel, 25-payline slot not only offers exciting opportunities to win, but also a Progressive Jackpot. With four bonus functions, this slot machine dedicated to the most famous Greek deity is versatile and lively.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the Hydra Bonus function, which awards cash prizes with a maximum 5x multiplier, but most importantly is the Hercules Rage function - it will make the Hydra's heads explode to release high sums. And not to forget, there is also a maximum of 20 free spins with a 3x multiplier and the Herculean Strength function, which offers re-spins during gameplay. \n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nGraphics are presented in a retro style, in line with classic land-based slot machines you can find in a casino. However, the story itself is rich in animations and plot twists that are worth exploring. The absolute protagonist is as mentioned, the powerful son of Zeus - Hercules - embarking on some of his most famous adventures. Alongside him, we have symbols such as Golden Apples, the legendary monster from Greek mythology - the Hydra, classic playing cards, and the three-headed dog. The latter symbol is the highest-valued, with 4,000 times the bet if it appears five times on a payline.\n\nThe highlight of the slot machine is the Hydra Bonus function, triggered when the monster appears on reels 1 and 5 simultaneously. You must choose between the Hydra's heads to eliminate and win the cash prizes hidden inside. If you're lucky in this phase, you can exploit the Hercules Rage function, which disintegrates all Hydra's heads in one go. If you manage to achieve this goal, Hercules will lead you to make a final decision - that related to the multiplier. In this way, your winnings can increase exponentially up to 5x.\n\nLet us not forget the free spins, which you can get if the Scatter symbol with \"Hercules\" appears on the reels. You can get your hands on 10 free spins and a 3x multiplier. With three more Scatters, you can get up to 20 free spins and activate the Herculean Strength function, which triggers re-spins with an expanding Wild that is locked onto the grid.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Age of the Gods: Prince of Olympus Slot\nWant a final surprise (which may not be a surprise at all!)? As with all slots in the Age of the Gods, there are also 4 random Progressive Jackpots. If you are lucky enough and have the patience required, you can dream big and change your life with one of the best-structured slot machines around.\n            ",

This 5-reel, 25-payline slot not only offers exciting opportunities to win, but also a Progressive Jackpot. With four bonus functions, this slot machine dedicated to the most famous Greek deity is versatile and lively.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the Hydra Bonus function, which awards cash prizes with a maximum 5x multiplier, but most importantly is the Hercules Rage function - it will make the Hydra's heads explode to release high sums. And not to forget, there is also a maximum of 20 free spins with a 3x multiplier and the Herculean Strength function, which offers re-spins during gameplay. \n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\nGraphics are presented in a retro style, in line with classic land-based slot machines you can find in a casino. However, the story itself is rich in animations and plot twists that are worth exploring. The absolute protagonist is as mentioned, the powerful son of Zeus - Hercules - embarking on some of his most famous adventures. Alongside him, we have symbols such as Golden Apples, the legendary monster from Greek mythology - the Hydra, classic playing cards, and the three-headed dog. The latter symbol is the highest-valued, with 4,000 times the bet if it appears five times on a payline.\n\nThe highlight of the slot machine is the Hydra Bonus function, triggered when the monster appears on reels 1 and 5 simultaneously. You must choose between the Hydra's heads to eliminate and win the cash prizes hidden inside. If you're lucky in this phase, you can exploit the Hercules Rage function, which disintegrates all Hydra's heads in one go. If you manage to achieve this goal, Hercules will lead you to make a final decision - that related to the multiplier. In this way, your winnings can increase exponentially up to 5x.\n\nLet us not forget the free spins, which you can get if the Scatter symbol with \"Hercules\" appears on the reels. You can get your hands on 10 free spins and a 3x multiplier. With three more Scatters, you can get up to 20 free spins and activate the Herculean Strength function, which triggers re-spins with an expanding Wild that is locked onto the grid.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Age of the Gods: Prince of Olympus Slot\nWant a final surprise (which may not be a surprise at all!)? As with all slots in the Age of the Gods, there are also 4 random Progressive Jackpots. If you are lucky enough and have the patience required, you can dream big and change your life with one of the best-structured slot machines around.\n            ",
