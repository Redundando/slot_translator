Flowers Christmas Edition brings back the incredibly successful slot game with a Christmas theme. The game's protagonists are the same carnivorous plants with sharp teeth and colorful flowers, only this time we find them immersed in a snowy landscape!\nThe initial screen of Flowers Christmas Edition is very simple, with the game title and protagonist flowers inserted in a background with snow. As for the game screen, the reels are set in a Christmas-themed frame with colored lights and the inevitable holly. The paylines are on either side of the reels, while at the bottom of the screen are buttons for game settings, including one to set the bet value, one to start the spins, and one to select the game level.\nYou can play Flowers Christmas Edition for real money or in a totally free demo version, from desktop computers, and all mobile devices, including iOS and Android. \n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nFlowers Christmas Edition is a slot machine characterized by a traditional game grid structure, with five reels, three rows, and 30 paylines. You can customize the bet by choosing levels from 1 to 10 and token values ranging from €0.01 to €0.5, for a total bet ranging from €0.03 to €150. The prizes in this floral-Christmas slot game go up to 5,000 coins, with gameplay that is not too complicated (nothing different in this respect from the previous slot).\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of Flowers Christmas Edition is an excellent 96.32%, a bit above average!\n\nSymbols and features of Flowers Christmas Edition\n\nIn addition to the classic real symbols, from the J to Ace playing cards, on the reels of Flowers Christmas Edition, we find the same symbols of the previous version, but with a Christmas twist.\n\nAs for the regular symbols, we have a red rose, a smiling sunflower, a hungry carnivorous plant, and a blue bellflower, while the special symbols are the Wild, a snowflake, which can replace all other symbols except the Scatter and pays 5,000 coins when it appears on all five reels.\n\nDuring free spins, the Wild assumes the form of Stacked Wilds, allowing even higher payouts.\n\nThe other special symbol is the Scatter, represented by another snowflake and the words \"free spins,\" and can appear singly or as a double symbol, giving access to free spins, where you can also benefit from various multipliers. \n\nTranslated and adapted for experienced gamblers.\n        ",
