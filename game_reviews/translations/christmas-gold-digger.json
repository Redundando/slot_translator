But that's exactly where he is in Christmas Gold Digger. \n\nEverything in this game reminds you of Christmas, from the decorated fir tree, to the bells, the lights, and the piles of snow. The graphics are well-made and offer some fun animations that accompany the bonuses. The typical jingle of this holiday also enhances the overall Christmas ambiance.\n\nWith fixed paylines and a reasonable RTP of 96%, this classic 5x3 grid game has 20 fixed paylines and a minimum bet of €0.20. The Autoplay function allows you to set automatic spins and win or loss limits, beyond which the feature stops. \n\nTo win in Christmas Gold Digger, you need to match identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding to the right. If multiple winning combinations appear on the same line, only the one with the highest value wins. If the combos occur on different lines, the winnings will be added up. The volatility is medium.\n\nBefore we look at the special features, let's take a quick look at the eight base symbols.

This mode features a brand new grid with four special counters made up of three squares to fill, and three respins available. However, every time a special symbol lands on the reels, the respins reset.

Here is how they behave:\n\nArrow: unlocks an additional row on the grid.\nDollar: increases the value of Nuggets.\nHeart: increases the number of Respins.\nPurple Gem: increases the multiplier level.\n\nDuring the base game, random modifiers may also intervene. Let's take a closer look at them:\n\nDynamite sticks transform three to five symbols into Wilds.\nThe pickaxe can transform symbols into Nuggets.\nTNT: Explodes and replaces low-level symbols with higher-paying ones.\n\nFAQs\n\nAre there any special symbols in Christmas Gold Digger?\n\nYes, there are three modifiers in addition to the Wild and Gold Nuggets.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player percentage in Christmas Gold Digger?\n\nThe RTP value is 96%, perfectly average.\n\nHow much does each spin cost?\n\nEach spin costs €0.01 for each of the 20 fixed paylines, making the total bet €0.20 per game.\n            ",

But that's exactly where he is in Christmas Gold Digger. \n\nEverything in this game reminds you of Christmas, from the decorated fir tree, to the bells, the lights, and the piles of snow. The graphics are well-made and offer some fun animations that accompany the bonuses. The typical jingle of this holiday also enhances the overall Christmas ambiance.\n\nWith fixed paylines and a reasonable RTP of 96%, this classic 5x3 grid game has 20 fixed paylines and a minimum bet of €0.20. The Autoplay function allows you to set automatic spins and win or loss limits, beyond which the feature stops. \n\nTo win in Christmas Gold Digger, you need to match identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding to the right. If multiple winning combinations appear on the same line, only the one with the highest value wins. If the combos occur on different lines, the winnings will be added up. The volatility is medium.\n\nBefore we look at the special features, let's take a quick look at the eight base symbols. The low-value symbols are playing cards, followed by the pickaxe, lantern, cart, and Santa Claus holding a gold nugget. The explosion is our Wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter and gems during Free Spins. \n\nFive or more Gold Nuggets unlock the Gold Hold & Win Respins. This mode features a brand new grid with four special counters made up of three squares to fill, and three respins available. However, every time a special symbol lands on the reels, the respins reset. There are only two types of symbols in the Bonus Game: the gold nuggets, which have variable values and remain fixed during the Respins, and the special symbols. Here is how they behave:\n\nArrow: unlocks an additional row on the grid.\nDollar: increases the value of Nuggets.\nHeart: increases the number of Respins.\nPurple Gem: increases the multiplier level.\n\nDuring the base game, random modifiers may also intervene. Let's take a closer look at them:\n\nDynamite sticks transform three to five symbols into Wilds.\nThe pickaxe can transform symbols into Nuggets.\nTNT: Explodes and replaces low-level symbols with higher-paying ones.\n\nFAQs\n\nAre there any special symbols in Christmas Gold Digger?\n\nYes, there are three modifiers in addition to the Wild and Gold Nuggets.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player percentage in Christmas Gold Digger?\n\nThe RTP value is 96%, perfectly average.\n\nHow much does each spin cost?\n\nEach spin costs €0.01 for each of the 20 fixed paylines, making the total bet €0.20 per game.\n            ",

The volatility is medium.\n\nBefore we look at the special features, let's take a quick look at the eight base symbols. The low-value symbols are playing cards, followed by the pickaxe, lantern, cart, and Santa Claus holding a gold nugget. The explosion is our Wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter and gems during Free Spins. \n\nFive or more Gold Nuggets unlock the Gold Hold & Win Respins. This mode features a brand new grid with four special counters made up of three squares to fill, and three respins available. However, every time a special symbol lands on the reels, the respins reset. There are only two types of symbols in the Bonus Game: the gold nuggets, which have variable values and remain fixed during the Respins, and the special symbols. Here is how they behave:\n\nArrow: unlocks an additional row on the grid.\nDollar: increases the value of Nuggets.\nHeart: increases the number of Respins.\nPurple Gem: increases the multiplier level.\n\nDuring the base game, random modifiers may also intervene. Let's take a closer look at them:\n\nDynamite sticks transform three to five symbols into Wilds.\nThe pickaxe can transform symbols into Nuggets.\nTNT: Explodes and replaces low-level symbols with higher-paying ones.\n\nFAQs\n\nAre there any special symbols in Christmas Gold Digger?\n\nYes, there are three modifiers in addition to the Wild and Gold Nuggets.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player percentage in Christmas Gold Digger?\n\nThe RTP value is 96%, perfectly average.\n\nHow much does each spin cost?\n\nEach spin costs €0.01 for each of the 20 fixed paylines, making the total bet €0.20 per game.\n        ",
