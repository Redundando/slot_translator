Developed by Bally, it is a 5x3 grid slot machine with an RTP of 94.2%. Its symbols include playing cards (A, K, Q, J and 10), Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds, the Dollar symbol and the wheel of fortune.\n\nGame Features and Mechanics\n\nBally's Cash Spin has a 5x3 game grid, which puts it right in the middle of the modern market compared to classic 3x3 slots. Its RTP of 94.2% is in line with modern standards. Among the special symbols found in the slot are the U-spin symbol and the money bag, which act as Scatters. Both require at least three identical symbols in a single play to trigger one of the two bonus modes. The U-Spin function allows you to spin a wheel with cash prizes and offers the possibility of getting free spins while the money bag activates the Coin purse function, where you can choose between three hidden cash prizes for corresponding wins. The game also features a Wild symbol that can replace the other normal symbols.\n\nSymbols and Bonuses\n\nCash Spin has a variety of symbols, including playing cards (A, K, Q, J and 10), Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds, the Dollar symbol and the wheel of fortune. The symbols are not poorly drawn despite the classic style, conveying simple graphics that may appeal to experienced players. The game also features two special Scatter symbols, the U-spin symbol and the money bag. The U-Spin function lets you spin a wheel with cash prizes and free spins while the money bag symbol activates the Coin purse function that rewards hidden cash prizes.\n\nSimilar Slot Games\n\nPlayers looking for a nostalgic taste can enjoy slot games containing classic fruit themes, such as Playson's Fruit Xtreme and Novomatic's Fruitilicious.\n\nDeveloper - Bally\n\nBally is a well-known developer that has been in the gaming market for over 50 years. They have developed some of the most iconic slots in the industry. Cash Spin is one of their classic-style slot games that infuses modern gaming concepts.\n\n        \n            ",

This game has a classic style, with modern features that appeal to both veterans and newcomers. With a 5*3 grid and 94.2% RTP, Cash Spin is an average modern slot game.\n\nGame design and features\n\nThe game theme of Cash Spin is retro-style. The symbols in the game include playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J, and 10), diamonds, rubies, emeralds, dollar symbols, and the wheel of fortune. The music starts over with every spin, which is a fast riff based on percussion. Cash Spin has a modern game grid with a 5*3 mechanism and 94.2% RTP.\n\nSymbol mix and significance\n\nCash Spin has a mix of symbols that includes playing card symbols, jewels, and special symbols like the wheel of fortune. The symbols in this game are not poorly drawn, rather they convey a sense of simplicity that is pleasing to some players. The playing card symbols are low-paying symbols while diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and the dollar symbol are high-paying symbols.\n\nSpecial symbols and bonus rounds\n\nCash Spin has two special symbols that trigger bonus rounds. These special symbols are the U-spin symbol and the money bag symbol. The U-spin symbol activates the U-spin bonus round, which allows players to spin a wheel with cash prizes and the possibility of getting free spins. The money bag symbol activates the Coin Purse bonus round, where players get to choose between three hidden cash prizes and get the corresponding win. Cash Spin also has a Wild symbol that can replace other normal symbols in the game.\n\nSimilar slot games\n\nIf players are looking for other slot games that have a similar nostalgic style, they can try Playson's Fruit Xtreme or Novomatic's Fruitilicious. These are both classic slots with fruit symbols, which is a trademark of classic slots.\n\n        \n            ",

The RTP also respects modern standards and laws, with a value of 94.2%.\nIn addition, we find several special symbols inside, once absent in epic slots. Among these we find the U-spin symbol and the money bag, both Scatter symbols that will require at least three of them (three identical symbols) in a single play to assign one of the two bonus modes.\nU-Spin, in particular, allows you to spin a wheel with cash prizes and the possibility of getting free spins while the money bag activates the Coin purse function, where you will have the chance to choose between three hidden cash prizes and get the corresponding win.\nIn addition to these, we also naturally find the Wild symbol capable of replacing the other normal symbols in the game as if it were a joker.\nSlots similar to Cash Spin\nIf we are looking for slots that leave us with a nostalgic taste in our mouths, it is enough to look for those that contain fruit inside them (one of the trademarks of classic slots), such as Playson's Fruit Xtreme or Novomatic's Fruitilicious.\n            ",

Some have wanted to distance themselves further and further from classic themes and have gone on to deal with movies and video games, while others have embraced the nostalgic side like Bally's Cash Spin.\nIn today's review, we will see if this choice has proven to be successful and we will discover what this slot has to offer us.\nCash Spin - A Retro Style\nJust one look at Bally's Cash Spin is enough to understand that the developer's goal was to create a hybrid: an online slot with all the modern features but with a classic style that could satisfy both veterans and newcomers.\nWe will talk about the functions in the next point, for the moment let's focus on the graphic and sound aspect: the music starts over with every single spin and it's a fast riff based on percussion. The symbols inside the grid are those you would expect from a classic title: in addition to the playing card symbols (A, K, Q, J and 10) we also find Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds, the Dollar symbol and the wheel of fortune (related to the special function).\nDespite the classic style, the symbols are not poorly drawn as we might expect, in fact: they convey a sense of simplicity that will satisfy some of the more experienced players.\nCash Spin - Two Special Functions\nSo let's talk about the gameplay mechanics: why did we say earlier that this is a modern slot disguised with a classic style?\nFirst of all for the game grid: with a 5*3 type mechanism, the slot is in the average of the modern market, compared to old style 3*3 slots. The RTP also respects modern standards and laws, with a value of 94.2%.\nIn addition, we find several special symbols inside, once absent in epic slots. Among these we find the U-spin symbol and the money bag, both Scatter symbols that will require at least three of them (three identical symbols) in a single play to assign one of the two bonus modes.\nU-Spin, in particular, allows you to spin a wheel with cash prizes and the possibility of getting free spins while the money bag activates the Coin purse function, where you will have the chance to choose between three hidden cash prizes and get the corresponding win.\nIn addition to these, we also naturally find the Wild symbol capable of replacing the other normal symbols in the game as if it were a joker.\nSlots similar to Cash Spin\nIf we are looking for slots that leave us with a nostalgic taste in our mouths, it is enough to look for those that contain fruit inside them (one of the trademarks of classic slots), such as Playson's Fruit Xtreme or Novomatic's Fruitilicious.\n        ",
