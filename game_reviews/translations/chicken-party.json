Today, we review Chicken Party by Booming Games both aesthetically and technically.\n\nChicken Party – Chickens in Real Life\nChicken Party’s game grid is housed in a coop, with greenery and mushrooms, fences, and haystacks in the background. The screen displays various symbols representing different types of chickens. In contrast to Fowl Play, Chicken Party has a more realistic depiction of the chicks, which blends well with the natural colorings of the rest of the slot. We appreciate the choice to represent the card symbols (A, K, Q, J…) with the chickens’ feathers, maintaining a cohesive and visually pleasing game grid.\n\nChicken Party – Game Mechanics\nLet’s dive into the game’s technicalities. Firstly, we have an RTP of 95.07% and a relatively high volatility. These factors respectively indicate the percentage of money issued as winnings in relation to the total bet (95% is the market average) and that we must wager and invest some money before we can aspire to higher-than-usual winnings. The game grid is a 4x3 format, which is unusual compared to the majority of titles that typically opt for a 5x3 format, displaying 12 symbols instead of the classical 15.\n\nHowever, up to four special symbols can appear above the grid that interacts differently with the combinations beneath them. These symbols can cause fox icons to appear (which align in a high-value combination), the golden egg-laying hen (which transforms the symbols below it into Wild symbols), and scatter symbols that allow access to the bonus mode when three or more appear.\n\nDespite having these special features, the slot is quite easy to comprehend when developing a strategy for play. The only aspect that can cause confusion is the golden egg-laying hen, which randomly transforms symbols beneath it into Wilds.\n\nSimilar slots to Chicken Party include the aforementioned Fowl Play series by WMG, ranging from the classic and timeless Fowl Play Gold to the recently released Fowl Play Xmas.",

The only aspect that can generate confusion is the hen with golden eggs, which does not always transform the symbols below into Wild, but does so randomly.\n\nSlots similar to Chicken Party\nIf we talk about slots similar to Chicken Party, we cannot fail to recommend the Fowl Play series we have already mentioned (by WMG), starting from the classic and timeless Fowl Play Gold up to the recently released Fowl Play Xmas.\n            ",

The game grid is set in a chicken coop, with a forest backdrop and various chicken symbols appearing on the reels.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nChicken Party is a 4x3 online slot game, with an RTP of 95.07% and high volatility. The slot has 12 symbols on the grid and up to four special symbols can appear above the grid which interact with the symbols on the grid to create winning combinations. The special symbols include Fox symbols, hen with golden eggs symbols, and Scatter symbols that trigger the bonus mode when at least three appear on the grid. The game is easy to understand and develop gaming strategies around, with the only potential confusion arising from the random use of the hen with golden eggs symbol.\n\nSymbols and Illustrations\n\nThe chicken symbols in Chicken Party have been illustrated in a realistic style that blends well with the natural green colors of the game backdrop. The playing card symbols have been integrated into the chicken symbols, and are created by folding the chicken feathers to form letters. The game grid and symbols create a uniform and pleasing aesthetic that is easy on the eyes.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nChicken Party has an RTP of 95.07%, which is around the market average for online slot games. The slot also has high volatility, indicating that players will need to bet for a while and invest some money before being able to potentially win bigger than usual. This makes Chicken Party best suited to players who are comfortable with higher risk and longer gameplay sessions.\n\nBonus Mode\n\nThe bonus mode in Chicken Party is triggered when at least three Scatter symbols appear on the game grid. During the bonus mode, players have the opportunity to win free spins and multipliers that can increase their winnings. This special feature, along with the other special symbols that can appear on the grid, creates a unique and engaging gameplay experience for players.\n\n        \n            ",

The game screen is set in a chicken coop with a forest as a backdrop, and the symbols represent different types of chickens that have been illustrated in a realistic style. The feathers of the chickens fold and create the symbols of the playing cards, making the grid uniform and pleasing to look at. The slot is equipped with special symbols that interact with the combinations appearing below. These special symbols include the Fox, the hen with golden eggs, and the Scatters, which allow players to access the bonus mode.\n\nDesign and theme\n\nThe theme of Chicken Party revolves around chickens and takes place in a chicken coop set in a forest. The game screen features mushrooms, fences, and hay bales. The design of the symbols represents different types of chickens and has been illustrated in a realistic style that blends well with the natural colors chosen for the rest of the game. The feathers of the chickens fold and create the symbols of the playing cards, making the grid uniform and pleasing to look at.\n\nSpecial symbols\n\nChicken Party is equipped with special symbols that interact with the combinations appearing below. The Fox symbol, when aligned in a combination, is of great value. The hen with golden eggs transforms the symbols below into Wild, i.e. wildcards, randomly. The Scatter symbols allow players to access the bonus mode by finding at least three.\n\nRTP and volatility\n\nChicken Party shows an RTP of 95.07%, which falls within the market average, and a rather high volatility. These two factors indicate that while players can expect to receive winnings at a reasonable frequency, they will be invited to bet for a while and invest some money before being able to aspire to a higher than usual win.\n\nBonus mode access and potential rewards\n\nPlayers can access the bonus mode by finding at least three Scatter symbols. In this mode, they can win up to 20 free spins. During the free spins, the special symbols continue to interact with the combinations appearing below, giving players a chance to achieve bigger wins. Chicken Party is quite easy to understand, allowing players to develop their own gaming strategies and enjoy the special features of the slot.\n\n        \n            ",

Inside the game screen, we can see the various symbols, which represent different types of chickens.\n\nThese have been illustrated in a more realistic style than Fowl Play, which actually blends very well with the natural colors chosen for the rest of the slot.\n\nWe appreciate the choice in representing the symbols of the playing cards (A, K, Q, J...). These usually do not fit well with the theme and are simply used to indicate lower-volume combinations. In Chicken Party, the feathers of the chickens fold and create these symbols, making the game grid uniform and pleasant to look at.\n\nChicken Party - Game mechanics\nLet's now delve into the slot from a purely technical point of view: first of all, we are faced with a slot that shows an RTP of 95.07% and a rather high volatility.\n\nThese two factors indicate, respectively, the percentage of money issued in the form of winnings in relation to those inserted in the form of bets (95% falls within the market average) and that we will be invited to bet for a while and invest some money before being able to aspire to a higher than usual win.\n\nThe game grid is of the 4*3 type. Unusual compared to most online titles that usually opt for a 5*3 grid, showing 12 symbols instead of the classic 15.\n\nHowever, up to four special symbols can appear above the grid, which interact in different ways with the combinations that appear below: they can bring out symbols of the Fox (which align in a combination of great value), the hen with golden eggs (which transforms the symbols below into Wild, i.e. wildcards), and the Scatter symbols that allow accessing the bonus mode by finding at least three.\n\nThe slot, despite being equipped with this special feature, is quite easy to understand in order to develop one's own gaming strategy. The only aspect that can generate confusion is the hen with golden eggs, which does not always transform the symbols below into Wild, but does so randomly.\n\nSlots similar to Chicken Party\nIf we talk about slots similar to Chicken Party, we cannot fail to recommend the Fowl Play series we have already mentioned (by WMG), starting from the classic and timeless Fowl Play Gold up to the recently released Fowl Play Xmas.\n            ",

Inside the game screen, we can see the various symbols, which represent different types of chickens.\n\nThese have been illustrated in a more realistic style than Fowl Play, which actually blends very well with the natural colors chosen for the rest of the slot.\n\nWe appreciate the choice in representing the symbols of the playing cards (A, K, Q, J...). These usually do not fit well with the theme and are simply used to indicate lower-volume combinations. In Chicken Party, the feathers of the chickens fold and create these symbols, making the game grid uniform and pleasant to look at.\n\nChicken Party - Game mechanics\nLet's now delve into the slot from a purely technical point of view: first of all, we are faced with a slot that shows an RTP of 95.07% and a rather high volatility.\n\nThese two factors indicate, respectively, the percentage of money issued in the form of winnings in relation to those inserted in the form of bets (95% falls within the market average) and that we will be invited to bet for a while and invest some money before being able to aspire to a higher than usual win.\n\nThe game grid is of the 4*3 type. Unusual compared to most online titles that usually opt for a 5*3 grid, showing 12 symbols instead of the classic 15.\n\nHowever, up to four special symbols can appear above the grid, which interact in different ways with the combinations that appear below: they can bring out symbols of the Fox (which align in a combination of great value), the hen with golden eggs (which transforms the symbols below into Wild, i.e. wildcards), and the Scatter symbols that allow accessing the bonus mode by finding at least three.\n\nThe slot, despite being equipped with this special feature, is quite easy to understand in order to develop one's own gaming strategy. The only aspect that can generate confusion is the hen with golden eggs, which does not always transform the symbols below into Wild, but does so randomly.\n\nSlots similar to Chicken Party\nIf we talk about slots similar to Chicken Party, we cannot fail to recommend the Fowl Play series we have already mentioned (by WMG), starting from the classic and timeless Fowl Play Gold up to the recently released Fowl Play Xmas.\n        ",
