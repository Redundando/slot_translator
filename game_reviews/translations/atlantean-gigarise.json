The god Poseidon, angry with the people of Atlantis for attempting to conquer Athens, caused the island to sink within twenty-four hours. Numerous scholars have unsuccessfully tried to find the exact location of the remains, but so far they have not succeeded.\n\nYGGDRASIL's slot takes us into the heart of this legendary city through high-level graphics. In the background of the underwater scene are the mountains and colonnades as described by Plato, the first to talk about Atlantis in his books.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay mechanics and features\nGame design and graphics\nSpecial symbols and their functions\nBetting options and limits\nVolatility and RTP\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Atlantean GigaRise\n\nLegend has it that Atlantis was a famous island located beyond the Pillars of Hercules, the limit with which the ancient Greeks indicated the known world. The god Poseidon, angry with the people of Atlantis for attempting to conquer Athens, caused the island to sink within twenty-four hours. Numerous scholars have unsuccessfully tried to find the exact location of the remains, but so far they have not succeeded.\n\nYGGDRASIL's slot takes us into the heart of this legendary city through high-level graphics. In the background of the underwater scene are the mountains and colonnades as described by Plato, the first to talk about Atlantis in his books. Oxygen bubbles, passing fish, and moving algae animate the scene, and suggestive music accompanies us during the entire gaming session. High definition combined with attention to detail make it clear that YGGDRASIL has decided to create a slot that has an exciting gameplay while also being visually beautiful.\n\nThe console is very minimal and is located at the bottom of the grid, providing all information on gameplay, ways to win, and buttons to start the game.\n\nSlot Features\nThe game grid has 5 reels and up to a maximum of 9 rows. Initially, the size of the reels is 4, 5, 6, 3, and 7. Each time a trident symbol appears on a reel, it increases by one slot. There are up to 294,912 ways to win. The minimum bet is €0.20, the maximum is €40, and up to 1,000 automatic spins can be activated, or even infinite.\n\nThe volatility of Atlantean GigaRise is high, while the RTP value is 96%.\n\nSymbols and Features\nYou win by matching at least 3 identical symbols starting from the left reel proceeding towards the right. \n\nThere are 10 regular symbols. Playing cards ten to ace are those that are worth less, followed by the amphora, lyre, shield with dagger, and golden jewel.\n\nThere are two special symbols: the column with the Wild inscription replaces all symbols except the special ones, and the oyster is our Scatter which gives us a number of Free Spins proportional to the number of symbols. If 5 were to appear, there will be 80 free spins! Free spins always start with a 5x3 grid, but the size can increase thanks to the trident symbol.\n\nAs mentioned above, each time this symbol appears, the reel moves up by one position. But what happens when the entire reel is covered and another trident lands? Simple, the Bonus game is activated. The amphora placed above the reel breaks and, depending on the type and color of the key, a door will be opened. The keys available are gold, silver, bronze, and Legendary. The screen at this point changes and we will have only one payline. Symbols that land on this payline will be collected. This is what you can win:\n\nMultipliers ranging from 1x to 200x the bet, depending on the type of key found.\nJackpot, there are 5 available, and they are all progressive, given that each bet contributes 3.8%. Moreover, there is no maximum limit, so in theory, there could be very high jackpots.\nFree Spins ranging from 20 to 80 in the base game, to which additional free spins can be added, ranging from 3 to 20 during the Bonus game.\n            ",

The god Poseidon, angry with the people of Atlantis for attempting to conquer Athens, caused the island to sink within twenty-four hours. Numerous scholars have unsuccessfully tried to find the exact location of the remains, but so far they have not succeeded.\n\nYGGDRASIL's slot takes us into the heart of this legendary city through high-level graphics. In the background of the underwater scene are the mountains and colonnades as described by Plato, the first to talk about Atlantis in his books. Oxygen bubbles, passing fish, and moving algae animate the scene, and suggestive music accompanies us during the entire gaming session. High definition combined with attention to detail make it clear that YGGDRASIL has decided to create a slot that has an exciting gameplay while also being visually beautiful.\n\nThe console is very minimal and is located at the bottom of the grid, providing all information on gameplay, ways to win, and buttons to start the game.\n\nSlot Features\nThe game grid has 5 reels and up to a maximum of 9 rows. Initially, the size of the reels is 4, 5, 6, 3, and 7. Each time a trident symbol appears on a reel, it increases by one slot. There are up to 294,912 ways to win. The minimum bet is €0.20, the maximum is €40, and up to 1,000 automatic spins can be activated, or even infinite.\n\nThe volatility of Atlantean GigaRise is high, while the RTP value is 96%.\n\nSymbols and Features\nYou win by matching at least 3 identical symbols starting from the left reel proceeding towards the right. \n\nThere are 10 regular symbols. Playing cards ten to ace are those that are worth less, followed by the amphora, lyre, shield with dagger, and golden jewel.\n\nThere are two special symbols: the column with the Wild inscription replaces all symbols except the special ones, and the oyster is our Scatter which gives us a number of Free Spins proportional to the number of symbols. If 5 were to appear, there will be 80 free spins! Free spins always start with a 5x3 grid, but the size can increase thanks to the trident symbol.\n\nAs mentioned above, each time this symbol appears, the reel moves up by one position. But what happens when the entire reel is covered and another trident lands? Simple, the Bonus game is activated. The amphora placed above the reel breaks and, depending on the type and color of the key, a door will be opened. The keys available are gold, silver, bronze, and Legendary. The screen at this point changes and we will have only one payline. Symbols that land on this payline will be collected. This is what you can win:\n\nMultipliers ranging from 1x to 200x the bet, depending on the type of key found.\nJackpot, there are 5 available, and they are all progressive, given that each bet contributes 3.8%. Moreover, there is no maximum limit, so in theory, there could be very high jackpots.\nFree Spins ranging from 20 to 80 in the base game, to which additional free spins can be added, ranging from 3 to 20 during the Bonus game.\n            ",

The god Poseidon, angry with the people of Atlantis for attempting to conquer Athens, caused the island to sink within twenty-four hours. Numerous scholars have unsuccessfully tried to find the exact location of the remains, but so far they have not succeeded.\n\nYGGDRASIL's slot takes us into the heart of this legendary city through high-level graphics. In the background of the underwater scene are the mountains and colonnades as described by Plato, the first to talk about Atlantis in his books. Oxygen bubbles, passing fish, and moving algae animate the scene, and suggestive music accompanies us during the entire gaming session. High definition combined with attention to detail make it clear that YGGDRASIL has decided to create a slot that has an exciting gameplay while also being visually beautiful.\n\nThe console is very minimal and is located at the bottom of the grid, providing all information on gameplay, ways to win, and buttons to start the game.\n\nSlot Features\nThe game grid has 5 reels and up to a maximum of 9 rows. Initially, the size of the reels is 4, 5, 6, 3, and 7. Each time a trident symbol appears on a reel, it increases by one slot. There are up to 294,912 ways to win. The minimum bet is €0.20, the maximum is €40, and up to 1,000 automatic spins can be activated, or even infinite.\n\nThe volatility of Atlantean GigaRise is high, while the RTP value is 96%.\n\nSymbols and Features\nYou win by matching at least 3 identical symbols starting from the left reel proceeding towards the right. \n\nThere are 10 regular symbols. Playing cards ten to ace are those that are worth less, followed by the amphora, lyre, shield with dagger, and golden jewel.\n\nThere are two special symbols: the column with the Wild inscription replaces all symbols except the special ones, and the oyster is our Scatter which gives us a number of Free Spins proportional to the number of symbols. If 5 were to appear, there will be 80 free spins! Free spins always start with a 5x3 grid, but the size can increase thanks to the trident symbol.\n\nAs mentioned above, each time this symbol appears, the reel moves up by one position. But what happens when the entire reel is covered and another trident lands? Simple, the Bonus game is activated. The amphora placed above the reel breaks and, depending on the type and color of the key, a door will be opened. The keys available are gold, silver, bronze, and Legendary. The screen at this point changes and we will have only one payline. Symbols that land on this payline will be collected. This is what you can win:\n\nMultipliers ranging from 1x to 200x the bet, depending on the type of key found.\nJackpot, there are 5 available, and they are all progressive, given that each bet contributes 3.8%. Moreover, there is no maximum limit, so in theory, there could be very high jackpots.\nFree Spins ranging from 20 to 80 in the base game, to which additional free spins can be added, ranging from 3 to 20 during the Bonus game.\n            ",
