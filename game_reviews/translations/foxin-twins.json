Siamo certi che anche voi rimarreste a bocca aperta, oltre a sorridere per l’assurdità della situazione. Gli ingredienti per dar vita a una slot spettacolare ci sono tutti e infatti la NextGen stavolta ha superato sé stessa, grazie anche al lavoro fatto sulla grafica. I simboli hanno lo stile dei cartoni animati, con animazioni di livello superiore a rendere lo spettacolo ancor più coinvolgente, come ad esempio la volpe che dal cielo cade sui rulli, trasformando i simboli in Wild. L’attenzione che la NextGen ha riposto in Foxin’ Twins la si intuisce anche dalla ricchezza di effetti sonori.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nAbbiamo già accennato al fatto che Foxin’ Twins ha ben due griglie di gioco, ognuna di esse con 5 rulli, 3 righe e 25 linee di pagamento. Quella di sinistra ha 3 moltiplicatori in alto che si attivano quando compare il simbolo Wild verde. Il costo di ogni partita regolare parte da un minimo di 0,25 € sino a un massimo di 6,25 €. Abbiamo utilizzato il termine “regolare” perché in Foxin’ Twins è possibile attivare il Super Bet, ossia 2 livelli di scommessa che prevedono la caduta frequente di simboli Wilds e altri Bonus che poi analizzeremo approfonditamente più avanti.\nFoxin’ Twins ha un RTP pari al 96,75% e una volatilità media.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nI simboli di basso valore sono rappresentati dalle carte da gioco dal 9 all’asso, seguiti dallo champagne e dal cancello, aereo e volpe a cavallo. Ci sono 2 Wilds paganti, uno blu nella griglia di destra e uno verde in quella di sinistra, entrambi rappresentati dalla volpe con la pipa. La loro funzione è quella di sostituire tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter e possono comparire solo sul rullo 3. Lo Scatter è rappresentato dai lingotti d’oro e ripaga con dei giri gratis. Vediamo ora cosa accade quando attiviamo la funzione Super Bet di livello 1 o 2:\n• Set di rulli rivela Jolly Blu: prima che le vincite vengano pagate, alcuni cuccioli di volpe potrebbero trasformare dei simboli in Wild. Nella scommessa di livello 1 appaiono sui rulli 2, 3, 4, in quella di livello 2 su tutti i rulli.\n• Set di rulli moltiplica Jolly Verdi: in questo caso le vincite vengono moltiplicate casualmente x3, x5 o x10 nella scommessa di livello 1, 5, x10, x20 in quella di livello 2. Senza la funzione Super Bet avremo un moltiplicatore x2, x3, x5.\n• Funzione casuale Jolly in più: i Jolly Blu vengono trasformati in Jolly verdi.\n• Funzione casuale Jolly a raffica: uno o più simboli sui rulli vengono trasformati in Jolly.\n",

Whether you choose to activate the Super Bet feature or not, Foxin Twins promises an exciting and thrilling gaming experience. So why not try your luck at spinning the reels and see if you can join the family of aristocratic foxes in their life of luxury!"

You would surely be astonished, and perhaps even amused by the absurdity of the situation. The ingredients for a spectacular slot game are all there and NextGen has outdone itself this time, thanks to the outstanding graphics and superior animations of cartoon-style symbols. The fox falling from the sky onto the reels is just one example that transforms symbols into Wilds, making the show more captivating. The attention to detail in Foxin' Twins is evident not only in the graphics, but also in the richness of the sound effects.\n\nSlot Features\n\nWe've already mentioned that Foxin' Twins has two game grids, each with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 paylines. The left grid features 3 multipliers on top that activate when the green Wild symbol appears. The cost per regular spin ranges from a minimum of €0.25 up to a maximum of €6.25. We used the term \"regular\" because in Foxin' Twins, it is possible to activate the Super Bet, which includes 2 levels of betting that provide frequent drops of Wild symbols and other bonuses that we will analyze in depth later. Foxin' Twins has an RTP of 96.75% and medium volatility.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nLow-value symbols are represented by playing cards from 9 to Ace, followed by champagne and a gate, airplane, and fox on horseback. There are 2 paying Wilds, one blue in the right grid and one green in the left grid, both represented by a fox with a pipe. Their function is to replace all symbols except for the Scatter and can only appear on reel 3. The Scatter is represented by gold bars and pays out with free spins. Let's now see what happens when we activate the Super Bet feature at level 1 or 2:\n\n• Blue Wild Reels Set: before the winnings are paid out, some fox cubs may transform symbols into Wilds. In the level 1 bet, they appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and in the level 2 bet, on all reels.\n\n• Green Wild Reels Set: in this case, the winnings are multiplied randomly by x3, x5, or x10 in the level 1 bet, and by x5, x10, x20 in the level 2 bet. Without the Super Bet feature, we would have a multiplier of x2, x3, or x5.\n\n• Additional Random Blue Wilds: Blue Wilds are transformed into Green Wilds.\n\n• Random Wild Reels: one or more symbols on the reels are transformed into Wilds.\n\nTranslation style: Casual and engaging, using gambling terminology and emphasizing the benefits of playing the game's features.\n            ",

You would surely be astonished, and perhaps even amused by the absurdity of the situation. The ingredients for a spectacular slot game are all there and NextGen has outdone itself this time, thanks to the outstanding graphics and superior animations of cartoon-style symbols. The fox falling from the sky onto the reels is just one example that transforms symbols into Wilds, making the show more captivating. The attention to detail in Foxin' Twins is evident not only in the graphics, but also in the richness of the sound effects.\n\nSlot Features\n\nWe've already mentioned that Foxin' Twins has two game grids, each with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 paylines. The left grid features 3 multipliers on top that activate when the green Wild symbol appears. The cost per regular spin ranges from a minimum of €0.25 up to a maximum of €6.25. We used the term \"regular\" because in Foxin' Twins, it is possible to activate the Super Bet, which includes 2 levels of betting that provide frequent drops of Wild symbols and other bonuses that we will analyze in depth later. Foxin' Twins has an RTP of 96.75% and medium volatility.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nLow-value symbols are represented by playing cards from 9 to Ace, followed by champagne and a gate, airplane, and fox on horseback. There are 2 paying Wilds, one blue in the right grid and one green in the left grid, both represented by a fox with a pipe. Their function is to replace all symbols except for the Scatter and can only appear on reel 3. The Scatter is represented by gold bars and pays out with free spins. Let's now see what happens when we activate the Super Bet feature at level 1 or 2:\n\n• Blue Wild Reels Set: before the winnings are paid out, some fox cubs may transform symbols into Wilds. In the level 1 bet, they appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and in the level 2 bet, on all reels.\n\n• Green Wild Reels Set: in this case, the winnings are multiplied randomly by x3, x5, or x10 in the level 1 bet, and by x5, x10, x20 in the level 2 bet. Without the Super Bet feature, we would have a multiplier of x2, x3, or x5.\n\n• Additional Random Blue Wilds: Blue Wilds are transformed into Green Wilds.\n\n• Random Wild Reels: one or more symbols on the reels are transformed into Wilds.\n\nTranslation style: Casual and engaging, using gambling terminology and emphasizing the benefits of playing the game's features.\n            ",

You would surely be astonished, and perhaps even amused by the absurdity of the situation. The ingredients for a spectacular slot game are all there and NextGen has outdone itself this time, thanks to the outstanding graphics and superior animations of cartoon-style symbols. The fox falling from the sky onto the reels is just one example that transforms symbols into Wilds, making the show more captivating. The attention to detail in Foxin' Twins is evident not only in the graphics, but also in the richness of the sound effects.\n\nSlot Features\n\nWe've already mentioned that Foxin' Twins has two game grids, each with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 25 paylines. The left grid features 3 multipliers on top that activate when the green Wild symbol appears. The cost per regular spin ranges from a minimum of €0.25 up to a maximum of €6.25. We used the term \"regular\" because in Foxin' Twins, it is possible to activate the Super Bet, which includes 2 levels of betting that provide frequent drops of Wild symbols and other bonuses that we will analyze in depth later. Foxin' Twins has an RTP of 96.75% and medium volatility.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nLow-value symbols are represented by playing cards from 9 to Ace, followed by champagne and a gate, airplane, and fox on horseback. There are 2 paying Wilds, one blue in the right grid and one green in the left grid, both represented by a fox with a pipe. Their function is to replace all symbols except for the Scatter and can only appear on reel 3. The Scatter is represented by gold bars and pays out with free spins. Let's now see what happens when we activate the Super Bet feature at level 1 or 2:\n\n• Blue Wild Reels Set: before the winnings are paid out, some fox cubs may transform symbols into Wilds. In the level 1 bet, they appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and in the level 2 bet, on all reels.\n\n• Green Wild Reels Set: in this case, the winnings are multiplied randomly by x3, x5, or x10 in the level 1 bet, and by x5, x10, x20 in the level 2 bet. Without the Super Bet feature, we would have a multiplier of x2, x3, or x5.\n\n• Additional Random Blue Wilds: Blue Wilds are transformed into Green Wilds.\n\n• Random Wild Reels: one or more symbols on the reels are transformed into Wilds.\n\nTranslation style: Casual and engaging, using gambling terminology and emphasizing the benefits of playing the game's features.\n            ",
