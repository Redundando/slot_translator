The main unique element of the game is that characters and symbols in the slot machine are all black and white, slowly gaining colors with each win. However, the theme is marred by the presence of electricity and illuminated street lamps, which detracts from the immersion. The game is relatively simple in terms of gameplay, featuring only a free spins function and an expandable grid that can unlock two additional rows. Despite its high RTP of 98.08%, other deficiencies in the game may deter many players.\n        ",

And, I bet you have never heard of this before, the game characters are black and white, and they uncharacteristically color with every win. How's that for breaking stereotypes?</p><p>Black and White does not have an extensive repertoire of gameplay features except for the free spins and an expandable grid.

The game backdrop consists of a city and a palace, but it has an unconvincing look due to the presence of visible electric energy. The game comprises characters such as a king, queen, prince, princess and some types of flowers, while the scatter symbol is represented by an explosion of various colors, and the wild symbol is depicted by a castle. Black and white characters represent the slot characters, and they begin to color with each win. The only gameplay features in the game are free spins and an expandable grid. The RTP of the game is 98.08%.\n\nMedieval Theme\n\nBlack and White follows a medieval theme. The game backdrop consists of a city and a palace, but the overall look is mediocre because it has a visible electric energy. Among the game symbols, we can see characters such as the king, queen, prince, princess, and various types of flowers. The game seems to be inspired by the popular Game of Thrones series, which is set in medieval times.\n\nUnique Black and White Characters\n\nThe Black and White slot game features black and white characters, which start to color with each win. This unique feature adds charm to the game as it has an excellent potential for immersing players in its world. However, this potential is underdeveloped as the rest of the game elements do not match the black and white characters' theme.\n\nGameplay Features\n\nBlack and White features two gameplay features, including free spins and an expandable grid. The free spins feature gets activated when you collect five or more scatter symbols, whereas the only other function present in the game is that of the expandable grid. Initially, the game grid is 5×3, but upon winning, players can unlock two additional rows, transforming it into a 5×5 grid. The game's simple gameplay features may not be enough to keep the players engaged for long periods.\n\nDeficiencies and Potential Drawbacks\n\nBlack and White has several drawbacks and deficiencies. Firstly, the background of the grid and the general look of the game is mediocre due to the presence of visible electric energy, which is not a desirable element for a medieval theme. Secondly, the expandable grid is the only feature that adds an element of excitement to the game. Thirdly, the character's black and white color theme has huge potential because of its unique factor, but it is not adequately developed. Finally, the only other feature in the game - free spins - is a standard feature that is present in many other slots. Because of these drawbacks, it is unlikely to attract a broad audience. \n\n        \n            ",

The game features a 5x3 grid that can be expanded up to 5x5, and includes symbols such as the king, queen, prince, princess, and various types of flowers.\n\nUnique elements of the game\n\nThe unique element of Black and White is the black and white world that all characters in the slot machine live in. As players win, the game gradually begins to colorize. However, this feature is not well-developed, and does not add much to the overall gameplay. There is also an expandable grid, and free spins can be activated by finding five or more scatter symbols.\n\nGameplay features\n\nBlack and White is a straightforward slot game, with only a few gameplay features beyond the grid expansion and free spins. The RTP is 98.08%, which is average, but there is little else to keep players engaged. Overall, the game is quite simple and may not hold players' attention for very long.\n\nTheme and Immersion\n\nDespite the medieval court theme, the immersion in Black and White is significantly undermined by the presence of modern electrical energy features, such as street lamps and illuminated windows. Furthermore, the black and white feature does not add much to the theme, and the symbols and environments are generic. Overall, the theme and immersion of the game are rather weak and do not contribute much to the player's experience.\n\nGame defeiciencies\n\nOne of the main deficiencies of Black and White is the weak execution of its theme and immersion, with modern features that undermine the medieval court setting. Additionally, the unique black and white element of the game is also not well-developed, and does not add much to the overall gameplay. Overall, the game is quite simple in terms of features, and may not hold players' attention for very long. Players looking for a similar black and white game are recommended to try Abby & The Witch instead.\n\n        \n            ",

Black And White, by Jade Rabbit Studio, is no exception, but with the addition of an exclusive element. Let's find out more in this review.\n\nIn the Court of Black and White\n\nIn the background of the Black and White grid we find a city and a palace, with a look that is strangely unsuccessful due to a very visible element that undermines all the immersion: electrical energy.\n\nA banal yet monumental mistake, in the village that serves as the backdrop for Black and White there are street lamps and houses with illuminated windows, both of which are very visible elements.\n\nAmong the symbols on the grid we find the king, queen, prince, princess and various types of flowers. The scatter symbol is represented by an explosion of different colors, while the wild symbol is depicted by a castle.\n\nThe main element, however, that accompanies the poorly executed medieval theme is that all the characters in the slot machine live in a black and white world, which will gradually begin to color with each win.\n\nUnfortunately, even this element turns out to be underdeveloped. Instead of a well-studied slot machine, whose symbols and environments match this functionality, we simply find a black and white filter on generic medieval figures.\n\nUnlocking Rows with Black and White\n\nEven in terms of gameplay, Black and White turns out to be particularly simple. In addition to the free spins, activated by finding 5 or more scatter symbols, the only other function present is that of the expandable grid.\n\nInitially the game grid will be 5×3, but by winning there will be the possibility of unlocking two additional rows, making it a 5×5 grid.\n\nTo accompany it all, there is an RTP of 98.08%, perfectly average, but when accompanied by other such weak elements it is unlikely to attract the interest of a large number of players.\n\nSlots Similar to Black and White\n\nIf Black and White has disappointed you, but you are looking for a slot machine that plays with black and white and the sudden appearance of colors, we highly recommend Abby & The Witch.\n            ",

Black And White, by Jade Rabbit Studio, is no exception, but with the addition of an exclusive element. Let's find out more in this review.\n\nIn the Court of Black and White\n\nIn the background of the Black and White grid we find a city and a palace, with a look that is strangely unsuccessful due to a very visible element that undermines all the immersion: electrical energy.\n\nA banal yet monumental mistake, in the village that serves as the backdrop for Black and White there are street lamps and houses with illuminated windows, both of which are very visible elements.\n\nAmong the symbols on the grid we find the king, queen, prince, princess and various types of flowers. The scatter symbol is represented by an explosion of different colors, while the wild symbol is depicted by a castle.\n\nThe main element, however, that accompanies the poorly executed medieval theme is that all the characters in the slot machine live in a black and white world, which will gradually begin to color with each win.\n\nUnfortunately, even this element turns out to be underdeveloped. Instead of a well-studied slot machine, whose symbols and environments match this functionality, we simply find a black and white filter on generic medieval figures.\n\nUnlocking Rows with Black and White\n\nEven in terms of gameplay, Black and White turns out to be particularly simple. In addition to the free spins, activated by finding 5 or more scatter symbols, the only other function present is that of the expandable grid.\n\nInitially the game grid will be 5×3, but by winning there will be the possibility of unlocking two additional rows, making it a 5×5 grid.\n\nTo accompany it all, there is an RTP of 98.08%, perfectly average, but when accompanied by other such weak elements it is unlikely to attract the interest of a large number of players.\n\nSlots Similar to Black and White\n\nIf Black and White has disappointed you, but you are looking for a slot machine that plays with black and white and the sudden appearance of colors, we highly recommend Abby & The Witch.\n        ",
