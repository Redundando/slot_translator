This is evident in Yggdrasil's online slot game Bugs Money, which takes us into nature.

It pays out good winnings if you can create lucky combinations with 3 or more identical symbols. Find out more!\nGraphics of Bugs Money Slot\nThe design and graphics choice for Bugs Money slot game is impeccable: we have a bright green lawn as the background that hosts our reels in a wooden frame. Among the game symbols, we have the classic playing cards, or rather the card suits for the lower values. We then move on to richer symbols like the blue flower, a butterfly, ladybug, and purple butterfly. We must also add our Scatter and Wild symbols, as well as the multiplier symbol, which is the queen bee, ready to appear during free spins.\nGame Features and Functions\nThe first real game-changer is the Glow Wilds feature, which can be activated randomly in both the base game and free spins. The reels will be invaded by Wilds, symbols that can increase your chances of obtaining big wins. \nFree spins, on the other hand, can be activated with at least 3 Scatter symbols in the same round. But before proceeding with this phase of the game, you are asked to choose between:\n \n- 3 free spins with a multiplier of x5, x10, x20, or x50;\n- 7 spins + multiplier at x3, x5, x10, or x20;\n- 10 free spins and a multiplier of x2, x3, x5, or x10;\n- 15 free spins and a multiplier at x1, x2, x3, or x5.\n \nIf the queen bee stops on reel 3, the multiplier will increase by 10 times.\nFinal Thoughts\nOverall, for its graphics and functionality offered, Bugs Money is one of the most interesting gaming solutions of the moment. It is fun, colorful and offers the potential for big wins. We particularly like the management of free spins and the importance the queen bee has in this game! \n\nFrequently Asked Questions \n- What is the maximum win you can get with the Bugs Money slot game? \nYou can potentially win up to 55,028 times your bet. \n\n- Does the online slot game have bonus features? \nYes, its free spins feature dominates the scene, thanks to its association with interesting multipliers. \n\n- Can I play Bugs Money slot game for free? \nYes, it is possible to find its demo version in online casinos or directly on our portal.\n            ",
