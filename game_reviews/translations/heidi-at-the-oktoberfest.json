During the standard game and free spins, the wild symbol will appear and behave as usual, replacing all other icons except Heidi's. The free spins feature is activated by landing five or more scatter symbols of the beautiful girl, starting from the first reel on the left and continuing on the next reel.\n\nFree spins\n\nWhen you activate the free spins feature, you'll be given five free spins to start off with, but there's potential to increase your free spins up to a maximum of 200. Every Heidi who has activated this extra feature will then transform into the wild symbol (beer toast) and remain locked in place for the duration of your free spins, increasing the potential for payouts. During free spins, you can also land more scatters to re-trigger the feature.\n\nMaximum payout\n\nThe maximum payout for Heidi at the Oktoberfest is 500 times your bet. You can win this by matching five symbols of the beer drinking guy. Whether you play with a low stake of €0.10 or a high roller's stake of €200, there's a 500x multiplier up for grabs.\n\nRTP and variance\n\nThe return to player percentage (RTP) for this slot game is 94.9%, with a medium-low variance. This means that the reels are designed to produce many winning combinations, and the volatility is low, making it possible to trigger free spins regularly. However, payouts may not be as large as in high volatility games.\n\nGraphics and sound\n\nHeidi at the Oktoberfest has graphics that depict the famous beer festival perfectly. The sound, animations, and graphics offer a perfect mix of entertainment and winnings. Festive music plays throughout the game, making for a lively atmosphere that will keep you entertained and feeling like you're in the middle of the beer festival.\n\n        \n            ",
