Spin the 5 reels and enjoy the Tumbling Reels feature where you can win with every consecutive drop!\n\nHigh 5 Games were the brains behind the classic slot Da Vinci Diamonds from IGT. But this leading developer now has a classic free slot game with Tumbling Reels. Let's put on our Italian garb and take a closer look at this exciting and volatile slot.\n\nCast your artistic eye on this Renaissance-inspired masterpiece delivered straight to your screen. With gems, famous artwork, and a maximum payout of 10,000x your bet, is the Da Vinci Extreme slot as intense as it sounds?\n\nBrilliant Graphics\nDa Vinci Extreme is one of those slots that is always on the list of 5-reel bonus slots by High 5 Games. In appearance and gameplay, it is very similar to Da Vinci Diamonds, a hit for IGT for which High 5 Games was a primary developer.\n\nThe graphics and music of the online Da Vinci Extreme slot are basic. However, the colorful gems, classical paintings, and ornate golden borders firmly place the player in the world of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nDa Vinci Extreme is a real money slot game from online casino legends produced by High 5 Games. You can adjust the coin size on the main screen, but we liked the Autoplay features that allow you to adjust the number of spins. Select up to 100 autoplay spins, or activate Turbo Spins for super-fast gameplay.\n\nYou can also program advanced settings such as Set Loss Limit and Stop Win Limit.\n\nThe online Da Vinci Extreme slot has a 5-reel configuration with 20 paylines. Coins start at just 0.01€ per line.\n\nThe slot machine uses the Tumbling Reels format. On each spin, the symbols fall into their reel positions. Winning combinations are removed from the reels, allowing free symbols to fall into place. You then receive a free respin reel. This process can continue indefinitely as you continue to hit winning combinations.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nSome of the symbols in the online Da Vinci Extreme slot game recall the artist's classical paintings. The Mona Lisa herself is one of the highest paying symbols, awarding up to 2500x for five of a kind.\n\nOther symbols include Da Vinci's musician portrait and his masterpiece, \"Lady with an Ermine.\" Colorful gems make up the low-limit symbols, paying 10x-500x depending on how many match on a payline.\n\nWhile Tumbling Reels adds excitement to the Da Vinci Extreme slot machine, the free spins really make it happen.\n\nThe free spins bonus is triggered by landing 3 or more BONUS symbols on a payline starting from reel 1. You can also trigger the spin after every spin where a BONUS symbol has not appeared.\n\nIn addition, you can win big bonus payouts by landing the painting symbols. You'll win a top prize worth 4000x for five woman symbols, 5000x for five musicians, and 6000x for five Mona Lisa symbols.\n\nAnd when you play Da Vinci Extreme slot online, you can activate additional free spins. Just land 3 more BONUS symbols to win 2-4 extra games, 4 BONUS icons for 4-10 games, or 5 BONUS symbols for 6-15 added spins.\n\nLike all the best online slots, Da Vinci Extreme has a wild symbol. The golden wild substitutes for any game symbol other than BONUS scatters. Frustratingly, however, wilds only appear on reels 2-4.\n\nLanding 3 bonus scatters triggers the Free Games Bonus or Da Vinci Extreme Free Spins with 6 free games available. But landing more scatters during this feature will trigger additional free games.\n\nGetting 3 more bonus symbols during the feature will get you 2-4 extra free games. Landing 4 bonus symbols awards 4-10 extra free spins, and every other 5 extra bonus symbols awards 6-15 extra spins.\n\nAnd the best part is that during free spins, you can stack up to 300 free spins! Perhaps it will never happen to you, as the probability is low, but it's worth trying!\n\nOur team of reviewers enjoyed the Da Vinci Extreme video slot game. It has many of the features of Da Vinci Diamonds without the high volatility. Tumbling Reels can lead to some lucrative respins, while the free spins feature has the potential for big jackpots.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDa Vinci Diamonds pioneered the Tumbling Reels format, and the game is still a hit with casino slot players everywhere. Like Da Vinci Extreme, you win cash by matching symbols on the reels. The Tumbling Reels feature is activated after every consecutive win. You can also win a jackpot worth 25,000x when you line up five reels."

Spin the 5 reels and enjoy the Tumbling Reels feature where you can win with every consecutive drop!\n\nHigh 5 Games were the brains behind the classic slot Da Vinci Diamonds from IGT. But this leading developer now has a classic free slot game with Tumbling Reels. Let's put on our Italian garb and take a closer look at this exciting and volatile slot.\n\nCast your artistic eye on this Renaissance-inspired masterpiece delivered straight to your screen. With gems, famous artwork, and a maximum payout of 10,000x your bet, is the Da Vinci Extreme slot as intense as it sounds?\n\nBrilliant Graphics\nDa Vinci Extreme is one of those slots that is always on the list of 5-reel bonus slots by High 5 Games. In appearance and gameplay, it is very similar to Da Vinci Diamonds, a hit for IGT for which High 5 Games was a primary developer.\n\nThe graphics and music of the online Da Vinci Extreme slot are basic. However, the colorful gems, classical paintings, and ornate golden borders firmly place the player in the world of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nDa Vinci Extreme is a real money slot game from online casino legends produced by High 5 Games. You can adjust the coin size on the main screen, but we liked the Autoplay features that allow you to adjust the number of spins.

Spin the 5 reels and enjoy the Tumbling Reels feature where you can win with every consecutive drop!\n\nHigh 5 Games were the brains behind the classic slot Da Vinci Diamonds from IGT. But this leading developer now has a classic free slot game with Tumbling Reels. Let's put on our Italian garb and take a closer look at this exciting and volatile slot.\n\nCast your artistic eye on this Renaissance-inspired masterpiece delivered straight to your screen. With gems, famous artwork, and a maximum payout of 10,000x your bet, is the Da Vinci Extreme slot as intense as it sounds?\n\nBrilliant Graphics\nDa Vinci Extreme is one of those slots that is always on the list of 5-reel bonus slots by High 5 Games. In appearance and gameplay, it is very similar to Da Vinci Diamonds, a hit for IGT for which High 5 Games was a primary developer.\n\nThe graphics and music of the online Da Vinci Extreme slot are basic. However, the colorful gems, classical paintings, and ornate golden borders firmly place the player in the world of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nDa Vinci Extreme is a real money slot game from online casino legends produced by High 5 Games. You can adjust the coin size on the main screen, but we liked the Autoplay features that allow you to adjust the number of spins. Select up to 100 autoplay spins, or activate Turbo Spins for super-fast gameplay.\n\nYou can also program advanced settings such as Set Loss Limit and Stop Win Limit.\n\nThe online Da Vinci Extreme slot has a 5-reel configuration with 20 paylines. Coins start at just 0.01€ per line.\n\nThe slot machine uses the Tumbling Reels format. On each spin, the symbols fall into their reel positions. Winning combinations are removed from the reels, allowing free symbols to fall into place. You then receive a free respin reel. This process can continue indefinitely as you continue to hit winning combinations.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nSome of the symbols in the online Da Vinci Extreme slot game recall the artist's classical paintings. The Mona Lisa herself is one of the highest paying symbols, awarding up to 2500x for five of a kind.\n\nOther symbols include Da Vinci's musician portrait and his masterpiece, \"Lady with an Ermine.\" Colorful gems make up the low-limit symbols, paying 10x-500x depending on how many match on a payline.\n\nWhile Tumbling Reels adds excitement to the Da Vinci Extreme slot machine, the free spins really make it happen.\n\nThe free spins bonus is triggered by landing 3 or more BONUS symbols on a payline starting from reel 1. You can also trigger the spin after every spin where a BONUS symbol has not appeared.\n\nIn addition, you can win big bonus payouts by landing the painting symbols. You'll win a top prize worth 4000x for five woman symbols, 5000x for five musicians, and 6000x for five Mona Lisa symbols.\n\nAnd when you play Da Vinci Extreme slot online, you can activate additional free spins. Just land 3 more BONUS symbols to win 2-4 extra games, 4 BONUS icons for 4-10 games, or 5 BONUS symbols for 6-15 added spins.\n\nLike all the best online slots, Da Vinci Extreme has a wild symbol. The golden wild substitutes for any game symbol other than BONUS scatters. Frustratingly, however, wilds only appear on reels 2-4.\n\nLanding 3 bonus scatters triggers the Free Games Bonus or Da Vinci Extreme Free Spins with 6 free games available. But landing more scatters during this feature will trigger additional free games.\n\nGetting 3 more bonus symbols during the feature will get you 2-4 extra free games. Landing 4 bonus symbols awards 4-10 extra free spins, and every other 5 extra bonus symbols awards 6-15 extra spins.\n\nAnd the best part is that during free spins, you can stack up to 300 free spins! Perhaps it will never happen to you, as the probability is low, but it's worth trying!\n\nOur team of reviewers enjoyed the Da Vinci Extreme video slot game. It has many of the features of Da Vinci Diamonds without the high volatility. Tumbling Reels can lead to some lucrative respins, while the free spins feature has the potential for big jackpots.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDa Vinci Diamonds pioneered the Tumbling Reels format, and the game is still a hit with casino slot players everywhere. Like Da Vinci Extreme, you win cash by matching symbols on the reels. The Tumbling Reels feature is activated after every consecutive win. You can also win a jackpot worth 25,000x when you line up five reels.\n            ",

Spin the 5 reels and enjoy the Tumbling Reels feature where you can win with every consecutive drop!\n\nHigh 5 Games were the brains behind the classic slot Da Vinci Diamonds from IGT. But this leading developer now has a classic free slot game with Tumbling Reels. Let's put on our Italian garb and take a closer look at this exciting and volatile slot.\n\nCast your artistic eye on this Renaissance-inspired masterpiece delivered straight to your screen. With gems, famous artwork, and a maximum payout of 10,000x your bet, is the Da Vinci Extreme slot as intense as it sounds?\n\nBrilliant Graphics\nDa Vinci Extreme is one of those slots that is always on the list of 5-reel bonus slots by High 5 Games. In appearance and gameplay, it is very similar to Da Vinci Diamonds, a hit for IGT for which High 5 Games was a primary developer.\n\nThe graphics and music of the online Da Vinci Extreme slot are basic. However, the colorful gems, classical paintings, and ornate golden borders firmly place the player in the world of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nDa Vinci Extreme is a real money slot game from online casino legends produced by High 5 Games. You can adjust the coin size on the main screen, but we liked the Autoplay features that allow you to adjust the number of spins. Select up to 100 autoplay spins, or activate Turbo Spins for super-fast gameplay.\n\nYou can also program advanced settings such as Set Loss Limit and Stop Win Limit.\n\nThe online Da Vinci Extreme slot has a 5-reel configuration with 20 paylines. Coins start at just 0.01€ per line.\n\nThe slot machine uses the Tumbling Reels format. On each spin, the symbols fall into their reel positions. Winning combinations are removed from the reels, allowing free symbols to fall into place. You then receive a free respin reel. This process can continue indefinitely as you continue to hit winning combinations.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nSome of the symbols in the online Da Vinci Extreme slot game recall the artist's classical paintings. The Mona Lisa herself is one of the highest paying symbols, awarding up to 2500x for five of a kind.\n\nOther symbols include Da Vinci's musician portrait and his masterpiece, \"Lady with an Ermine.\" Colorful gems make up the low-limit symbols, paying 10x-500x depending on how many match on a payline.\n\nWhile Tumbling Reels adds excitement to the Da Vinci Extreme slot machine, the free spins really make it happen.\n\nThe free spins bonus is triggered by landing 3 or more BONUS symbols on a payline starting from reel 1. You can also trigger the spin after every spin where a BONUS symbol has not appeared.\n\nIn addition, you can win big bonus payouts by landing the painting symbols. You'll win a top prize worth 4000x for five woman symbols, 5000x for five musicians, and 6000x for five Mona Lisa symbols.\n\nAnd when you play Da Vinci Extreme slot online, you can activate additional free spins. Just land 3 more BONUS symbols to win 2-4 extra games, 4 BONUS icons for 4-10 games, or 5 BONUS symbols for 6-15 added spins.\n\nLike all the best online slots, Da Vinci Extreme has a wild symbol. The golden wild substitutes for any game symbol other than BONUS scatters. Frustratingly, however, wilds only appear on reels 2-4.\n\nLanding 3 bonus scatters triggers the Free Games Bonus or Da Vinci Extreme Free Spins with 6 free games available. But landing more scatters during this feature will trigger additional free games.\n\nGetting 3 more bonus symbols during the feature will get you 2-4 extra free games. Landing 4 bonus symbols awards 4-10 extra free spins, and every other 5 extra bonus symbols awards 6-15 extra spins.\n\nAnd the best part is that during free spins, you can stack up to 300 free spins! Perhaps it will never happen to you, as the probability is low, but it's worth trying!\n\nOur team of reviewers enjoyed the Da Vinci Extreme video slot game. It has many of the features of Da Vinci Diamonds without the high volatility. Tumbling Reels can lead to some lucrative respins, while the free spins feature has the potential for big jackpots.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDa Vinci Diamonds pioneered the Tumbling Reels format, and the game is still a hit with casino slot players everywhere. Like Da Vinci Extreme, you win cash by matching symbols on the reels. The Tumbling Reels feature is activated after every consecutive win. You can also win a jackpot worth 25,000x when you line up five reels.\n            ",
