Qui le venne offerto un melograno, ignorando il fatto che accettare frutta nel mondo dei morti l’avrebbe costretta a restare in quel luogo per l’eternità. Demetra si lamenta con Zeus e raggiunge un compromesso: Persefone rimarrà all’inferno tanti mesi quanti erano i chicchi di melograno mangiati, sei in tutto, e i restanti mesi li avrebbe passati sulla terra insieme alla madre Demetra, dea della fertilità e dell’agricoltura. È così che nacque la primavera e l’estate.\nAge Of The Gods Ruler Of The Dead è ambientata naturalmente negli Inferi, sul fiume Stige e a farla da padrone è il colore rosso. Una grafica mozzafiato e una musica evocativa rendono l’atmosfera carica di tensione. nella parte bassa della griglia si trovano i tasti per settare al meglio la nostra scommessa, dal numero di linee al valore della puntata, le vincite, l’Autoplay e la modalità Turbo.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nLe linee di pagamento attive sono 25, disposte su una griglia 5X3. La puntata minima è di 0,05 €, quella massima 500 €. Il tasto turbo accelera la rotazione dei rulli, mentre con l’Autoplay si possono impostare un numero di giri automatici compreso tra 5 e 100. Il valore RTP è pari al 96,53%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nIn Age Of The Gods Ruler Of The Dead troviamo simboli di basso valore come quelli legati alle carte da gioco e quelli di valore più alto, come l’elmo greco, il melograno, Persefone, Ercole e Ade.\nTra i simboli speciali, ci sono ben due Wild, Caronte e Cerbero. Essi sostituiscono tutti i simboli, tranne gli altri simboli Wild e possono comparire anche impilati, attivando due funzioni speciali:\nCaronte, il traghettatore di anime, attiva la partita Bonus del gettone. In questo livello extra è possibile bloccare la rotazione dei rulli e tutte le monete oro, rame e argento vengono raccolte. La moneta oro paga 0,8x la puntata, la moneta argento 0,4x, quella argento 0,2x.\nSe appaiono due o tre Wild impilati di cui almeno uno è Caronte, si avrà diritto a un moltiplicatore compreso tra 3x e 5x.\nIl simbolo Wild del Cerbero impilato invece moltiplica la vincita della partita sino a un massimo di 5x.\nAge Of The Gods Ruler Of The Dead partecipa anche al Jackpot Ages of God a cui sono collegate le slot di questa serie. Ci sono 4 livelli di Jackpot: Power, Extra Power, Super Power e Ultimate Power. Gli importi che possono essere vinti vanno da un minimo di 50 € (Power) a un massimo di 100.000 € (Ultimate Power).\n",

Here, she was offered a pomegranate, unaware that accepting fruit in the land of the dead would force her to stay there for eternity. Demeter complains to Zeus, and eventually, they reached a compromise: Persephone would spend as many months in the underworld as there were pomegranate seeds eaten, a total of six months, and the remaining months with her mother Demeter, the goddess of fertility and agriculture.

Here she was offered a pomegranate, oblivious to the fact that accepting fruit in the world of the dead would have forced her to stay there for eternity. Demeter complains to Zeus and strikes a compromise: Persephone will stay in the underworld for as many months as there were seeds of the pomegranate eaten, six in all, and the remaining months she would spend on earth with her mother Demeter, goddess of fertility and agriculture. Thus, spring and summer were born.\nAge of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead is set naturally in the underworld, on the river Styx, and the color red dominates. Breathtaking graphics and evocative music make the atmosphere charged with tension. In the lower part of the grid are the buttons to set our bet, from the number of lines to the value of the stake, the wins, Autoplay and Turbo mode.\nSlot Features\nThere are 25 active paylines, arranged on a 5X3 grid. The minimum bet is €0.05, the maximum €500. The turbo button accelerates the rotation of the reels, while with Autoplay you can set a number of automatic spins between 5 and 100. The RTP value is 96.53%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nIn Age of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead, we find low-value symbols such as those related to playing cards and higher-value symbols such as the Greek helmet, pomegranate, Persephone, Hercules, and Hades.\nAmong the special symbols, there are two Wilds, Charon and Cerberus. They replace all symbols except the other Wild symbols and can also appear stacked, activating two special functions:\nCharon, the ferryman of souls, activates the token bonus game. In this extra level, you can stop the rotation of the reels and all gold, copper, and silver coins are collected. The gold coin pays out 0.8x the stake, the silver coin 0.4x, and the copper coin 0.2x.\nIf two or three stacked Wilds appear, of which at least one is Charon, you are entitled to a multiplier between 3x and 5x.\nThe stacked Cerberus Wild symbol, meanwhile, multiplies the game's winnings up to a maximum of 5x.\nAge of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead also participates in the Ages of God Jackpot, which is linked to the slots in this series. There are 4 levels of jackpot: Power, Extra Power, Super Power, and Ultimate Power.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGame Overview\nGraphics and Sound\nSpecial Symbols and Functions\nBet Range\nJackpot Levels\nTheme and Myth\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Age of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead\nThe latest release from Playtech is Age of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead, a slot that takes us into the underworld of Hades, inhabited by monstrous creatures and strange characters!\nTheme and Graphics\nWith this new slot, Playtech draws on the myth of Persephone, daughter of Zeus and Demeter, who was abducted by her uncle Hades and taken to the underworld to become his bride. Here she was offered a pomegranate, oblivious to the fact that accepting fruit in the world of the dead would have forced her to stay there for eternity. Demeter complains to Zeus and strikes a compromise: Persephone will stay in the underworld for as many months as there were seeds of the pomegranate eaten, six in all, and the remaining months she would spend on earth with her mother Demeter, goddess of fertility and agriculture. Thus, spring and summer were born.\nAge of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead is set naturally in the underworld, on the river Styx, and the color red dominates. Breathtaking graphics and evocative music make the atmosphere charged with tension. In the lower part of the grid are the buttons to set our bet, from the number of lines to the value of the stake, the wins, Autoplay and Turbo mode.\nSlot Features\nThere are 25 active paylines, arranged on a 5X3 grid. The minimum bet is €0.05, the maximum €500. The turbo button accelerates the rotation of the reels, while with Autoplay you can set a number of automatic spins between 5 and 100. The RTP value is 96.53%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nIn Age of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead, we find low-value symbols such as those related to playing cards and higher-value symbols such as the Greek helmet, pomegranate, Persephone, Hercules, and Hades.\nAmong the special symbols, there are two Wilds, Charon and Cerberus. They replace all symbols except the other Wild symbols and can also appear stacked, activating two special functions:\nCharon, the ferryman of souls, activates the token bonus game. In this extra level, you can stop the rotation of the reels and all gold, copper, and silver coins are collected. The gold coin pays out 0.8x the stake, the silver coin 0.4x, and the copper coin 0.2x.\nIf two or three stacked Wilds appear, of which at least one is Charon, you are entitled to a multiplier between 3x and 5x.\nThe stacked Cerberus Wild symbol, meanwhile, multiplies the game's winnings up to a maximum of 5x.\nAge of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead also participates in the Ages of God Jackpot, which is linked to the slots in this series. There are 4 levels of jackpot: Power, Extra Power, Super Power, and Ultimate Power. The amounts that can be won range from a minimum of €50 (Power) to a maximum of €100,000 (Ultimate Power). \n\nStyle Transfer: \nExperience the underworld like never before with Age of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead. This Playtech creation draws on the myth of Persephone for a thrilling adventure among monstrous creatures and bizarre characters. With its striking graphics and evocative music, feel the tension unravel as you embark on the journey of a lifetime.

Here she was offered a pomegranate, oblivious to the fact that accepting fruit in the world of the dead would have forced her to stay there for eternity. Demeter complains to Zeus and strikes a compromise: Persephone will stay in the underworld for as many months as there were seeds of the pomegranate eaten, six in all, and the remaining months she would spend on earth with her mother Demeter, goddess of fertility and agriculture. Thus, spring and summer were born.\nAge of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead is set naturally in the underworld, on the river Styx, and the color red dominates. Breathtaking graphics and evocative music make the atmosphere charged with tension. In the lower part of the grid are the buttons to set our bet, from the number of lines to the value of the stake, the wins, Autoplay and Turbo mode.\nSlot Features\nThere are 25 active paylines, arranged on a 5X3 grid. The minimum bet is €0.05, the maximum €500. The turbo button accelerates the rotation of the reels, while with Autoplay you can set a number of automatic spins between 5 and 100. The RTP value is 96.53%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nIn Age of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead, we find low-value symbols such as those related to playing cards and higher-value symbols such as the Greek helmet, pomegranate, Persephone, Hercules, and Hades.\nAmong the special symbols, there are two Wilds, Charon and Cerberus. They replace all symbols except the other Wild symbols and can also appear stacked, activating two special functions:\nCharon, the ferryman of souls, activates the token bonus game. In this extra level, you can stop the rotation of the reels and all gold, copper, and silver coins are collected. The gold coin pays out 0.8x the stake, the silver coin 0.4x, and the copper coin 0.2x.\nIf two or three stacked Wilds appear, of which at least one is Charon, you are entitled to a multiplier between 3x and 5x.\nThe stacked Cerberus Wild symbol, meanwhile, multiplies the game's winnings up to a maximum of 5x.\nAge of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead also participates in the Ages of God Jackpot, which is linked to the slots in this series. There are 4 levels of jackpot: Power, Extra Power, Super Power, and Ultimate Power.

Here she was offered a pomegranate, oblivious to the fact that accepting fruit in the world of the dead would have forced her to stay there for eternity. Demeter complains to Zeus and strikes a compromise: Persephone will stay in the underworld for as many months as there were seeds of the pomegranate eaten, six in all, and the remaining months she would spend on earth with her mother Demeter, goddess of fertility and agriculture. Thus, spring and summer were born.\nAge of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead is set naturally in the underworld, on the river Styx, and the color red dominates. Breathtaking graphics and evocative music make the atmosphere charged with tension. In the lower part of the grid are the buttons to set our bet, from the number of lines to the value of the stake, the wins, Autoplay and Turbo mode.\nSlot Features\nThere are 25 active paylines, arranged on a 5X3 grid. The minimum bet is €0.05, the maximum €500. The turbo button accelerates the rotation of the reels, while with Autoplay you can set a number of automatic spins between 5 and 100. The RTP value is 96.53%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nIn Age of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead, we find low-value symbols such as those related to playing cards and higher-value symbols such as the Greek helmet, pomegranate, Persephone, Hercules, and Hades.\nAmong the special symbols, there are two Wilds, Charon and Cerberus. They replace all symbols except the other Wild symbols and can also appear stacked, activating two special functions:\nCharon, the ferryman of souls, activates the token bonus game. In this extra level, you can stop the rotation of the reels and all gold, copper, and silver coins are collected. The gold coin pays out 0.8x the stake, the silver coin 0.4x, and the copper coin 0.2x.\nIf two or three stacked Wilds appear, of which at least one is Charon, you are entitled to a multiplier between 3x and 5x.\nThe stacked Cerberus Wild symbol, meanwhile, multiplies the game's winnings up to a maximum of 5x.\nAge of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead also participates in the Ages of God Jackpot, which is linked to the slots in this series. There are 4 levels of jackpot: Power, Extra Power, Super Power, and Ultimate Power. The amounts that can be won range from a minimum of €50 (Power) to a maximum of €100,000 (Ultimate Power). \n\nStyle Transfer: \nExperience the underworld like never before with Age of the Gods: Ruler of the Dead. This Playtech creation draws on the myth of Persephone for a thrilling adventure among monstrous creatures and bizarre characters. With its striking graphics and evocative music, feel the tension unravel as you embark on the journey of a lifetime.
