            "prompt": "\n        Below is a review of the game \"Extra Juicy\".\n\n        Please provide a detailed prompt for DALLE to create a feature image fitting the game\n        \n        - The image should be in cartoon style\n        - The should feature a happy Maya warrior with glasses\n\n        Review: Extra Juicy\nGeneral Information\nSoftware: Pragmatic Play\nReels: 5\nPaylines: 10\nMinimum bet amount: €0.10\nMaximum bet amount: €50\nReturn to Player (RTP): 96.5%\nVolatility: Medium to high\nMain Features\nIn Pragmatic Play's catalog, we had a bit of a hard time finding a slot machine that harks back to the old land-based gaming machines: although there are several three-reel games that are therefore \"old school\", Extra Juicy may be the only one that, in terms of style, graphics and gameplay, really recalls the traditional Fruit Machine.\nSo if you're a nostalgic for gaming halls and looking for a classic slot even among those from this provider, well, Extra Juicy is just what you need!\nBut don't be fooled by the retro taste of this game: alongside a very traditional graphics, it offers a quite complex gameplay and with medium to high volatility it gives you the chance to win some nice prizes!\nFirst of all, there are five reels, not the classic three, and ten paylines, with a betting range that goes from €0.10 up to €50. Then we have the chance to take advantage of multipliers and bonus spins that increase the chances of winning and, finally, we can also play in Autoplay mode, after setting the number of spins and the maximum win and loss amounts.\nThe symbols of Extra Juicy\nLike any respectable Fruit Machine, Extra Juicy provides that its symbols are represented by colorful fruits: we have cherries (the classic cherries that for so long were the icon of slot machines), lemons, oranges, plums, and watermelons, as well as the traditional bell always present in this type of slot.\nThe symbol that pays the least is the one with cherries, while the one with the highest value is the bell; you can consult the paytable before starting to play to discover the value of each symbol.\nA big and shining diamond represents the game's scatter symbol: it appears only on odd reels (1, 3, and 5) and allows you to access many free spins and a progressive multiplier.\nFruit machines: a timeless classic\nIf this type of slot machine never stops exerting a charm on you, then you should also try some of the others in the catalog of various providers.\nWe only mention a few, but if you feel like doing a little online research, you will discover that there really are ones for all tastes, from those with a more classic setting, to modern reinterpretations.\nOne of these with a very classic style is Super Fruit 7, which faithfully reproduces the graphics of old land-based slots, with fruits, 7s, and BAR symbols; if instead you want to try a fun variation on the theme, we recommend Don Corlimone, where fruits and vegetables take on the appearance of a gang of gangsters in 1920s New York.\nLastly, we point out Fruit Shop, with a very lively cartoon-style graphics, which also includes a Christmas version called Fruit Shop Christmas Edition.\n        ",

She is surrounded by colorful fruits, with a big and shining diamond in the background representing the game's scatter symbol. The Maya warrior is holding a slot machine lever, with excitement on her face as she strikes a winning combination. The image should be eye-catching, vibrant, and playful, reflecting the game's fun and nostalgic theme."
