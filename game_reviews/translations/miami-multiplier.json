The Miami Multiplier slot game is one of the new online gaming products developed by the young brand Hacksaw Gaming and available in our library. Dive into the magical nightlife of this cosmopolitan city and try the Multiplier mode right away!\n\nBright and simple icons flood the display when playing without downloading the Miami Multiplier slot, making you feel like you're truly in Miami Beach. With exclusive cocktail icons, dolphins, stars, watermelons, ice cream cones, and the ever-present palms that distinguish the Miami Beach promenade, all lit up in neon.\n\nWhat's the main feature in Miami Multiplier? You should have guessed it from the title... This game is based on multipliers! Set on a 4x4 grid, with a maximum win of 5000X, the slot allows you to progressively add multipliers during free rotation mode upwards until reaching the top at 60X!\n\nA slot with thrilling free spins where you can get at least three Free Spin symbols to activate the free rotation function. During this function, all Multiplier symbols are progressively added for the rest of the round. After each free spin, the win during the current spin will be multiplied by the currently displayed multiplier:\n\n3 symbols will give you 8 spins\n4 symbols will give you 15 spins.\n\nPay attention to the X symbol, which will allow you to get closer to the most interesting multipliers:\n\n1 X will give you a 2X multiplier,\n2 X will give you a 3X multiplier and so on...\n\nSo, every X symbol added to the counter, and every win derived from the multiplier you have progressively accumulated during your spins. Technically, it's possible to get up to a 60x multiplier, but it's much more likely that you'll hit a 6X or 12X multiplier by the end of the round.\n\nSome extra features: In addition to the thrill of free spins, the game offers a pretty decent RTP of 96.30% with a predetermined Hit Frequency of about 32.88% and a volatility of 4 out of 5. The betting levels range from a minimum of €0.2 up to a maximum amount of €100, with the possibility of winning up to 5,000 times your bet!\n\nMy final thoughts on this electrifying slot: The multipliers are hot, and the free spins are ready to deliver incredible wins. The easy-to-find icons and cool Miami atmosphere make the spins exciting. Don't miss out on the X symbol that could get you spectacular wins thanks to the Multiplier functionality, which makes this slot free and playable in our online casinos, a precious treasure trove of winning combinations!\n        ",
