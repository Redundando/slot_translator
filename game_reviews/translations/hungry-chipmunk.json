Se la risposta è affermativa è giunto il momento di provare la slot machine online Hungry Chipmunk, con i suoi 5 rulli e le 25 linee di pagamento. La scena di gioco si svolge su un albero, luogo perfetto dove costruire una tana che sia la culla dei mesi più freddi per il nostro protagonista. Sia chiaro però: il nostro amico scoiattolo però non è un simbolo di gioco, ma appare sporadicamente sullo schermo e anima l’intero gameplay. Di seguito in questa recensione scopriremo insieme quali sono le caratteristiche tecniche e grafiche di questa macchinetta online. Inoltre parleremo di tutte le curiosità che la rendono un titolo amato da giocatori pro e principianti.\nGrafica e funzioni di gioco\nWild, simbolo Scattel, bonus e giri gratuiti: tutto ciò che sogni è stato pensato e inserito all’intero di questo titolo che porta la firma italiana della casa di produzione software Tuko. La scelta grafica è molto semplice e pulita, senza troppi fronzoli che rischiano di far perdere il divertimento legato all’esperienza di gioco. Il nostro scoiattolino di cosa è ghiotto? Forse di Ghiande e Nocciole, ma anche di Semi di Girasole, senza dimenticare poi le Noccioline: e queste figure sono state scelte per rappresentare i simboli del game. Tra i simboli extra troviamo la scritta Wild che va a rappresentare il senso stesso dell’icona: è un jolly che aiuta a formare delle combinazioni non complete per poi trasformarle in vincenti. Lo Scatter e il Bonus non sono raggiungibili dal Wild, e quindi non potranno essere sostituiti in fase di gioco. La Ghianda è stata scelta come Scatter, può apparire ovunque e restituisce moltiplicazioni delle scommesse, oltre ad attivare i nostri amati free spin. Non possiamo però dimenticare di citare anche i moltiplicatori casuali, che appaiono con simboli che hanno la cifra esatta del valore si moltiplicazione. Si varia da x2, x3 e x4!\nIl bonus dei giri gratuiti offre al giocatore fino a 15 spin (il minimo è di 5), purché appaiano sullo schermo 3 o più simboli della Ghianda singola in qualsiasi punto dei rulli. E invece che dire del bonus game? La slot online Hungry Chipmunk ci permette di cambiare completamente lo scenario con 3 simboli delle Ghiande Dorate. Lo scopo del gamer è di raggiungerne uno dei 3, attraversando un labirinto. Non appena si arriva a destinazione, ci si assicura il valore della vincita riportata\nConsiderazioni finali della slot Hungry Chipmunk\nSiamo giunti alla fine del nostro viaggio in compagnia di questo simpatico scoiattolino che stravolgerà positivamente la tua avventura con le slot online. Mancano solo le ultime informazioni tecniche: il gioco prevede una puntata minima di 0,01cent per arrivare a 50 euro. La puntata di default è fissata a 0,25€ con possibilità di usare una moneta per payline. Nel complesso abbiamo 25 payline e un numero di free spin massimo che arriva a 15. La percentuale di ritorno in vincita arriva a quota a 96,45%, quindi in linea con la media offerta dalla software house.\n",

Bonus free spin rounds offer up to 15 spins when three or more single acorn symbols appear on the reels, whereas the bonus game involves navigating a maze to reach one of three golden acorns and secure winning value.'}\n         ",
