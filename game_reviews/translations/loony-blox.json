For example, if an Elephant is visible on the screen, then Cactus Wild will act as an expanding Wild and cover all positions on the reel. When Wolf appears, your chances of winning double. The Rabbit symbol helps you stop a random spin if it appears on 2 to 5 reels.\n\nHow does Loony Box's Map work?\n\nThis feature is activated if one of the character symbols appears during the winning combination in the base game. In the Map feature, the racing cars with Wolf, Elephant, or Rabbit will move one point for each of the triggering character symbols. Cactus Wild is not used in the activation combination. If there are multiple directions available, the choice will be made entirely randomly.\n\nWhat is the Loony Box Free Spin Feature?\n\nIf one of the racing cars with Elephant, Wolf, or Rabbit lands on the green point, then you receive 12 Free Spins. Running on a map that reminds us a bit of Mario Kart, when you land, combinations corresponding to one of the 3 animals will form. The start of the racing cars then activates the character symbols during the duration of the free games.\n\nWhy choose the registration-free slot Loony Blox?\n\nThe cartoon factor combined with fun and carefree gameplay represent the winning combo of this no-download slot available in one of our best AAMS-ADM casinos selected for you by our team of online slot enthusiasts.

The cartoon-themed setting of the game is colorful and visually appealing, which will be sure to evoke childhood nostalgia.\n\nExpanding Wilds\n\nCactus Wild is the highest-paid symbol in this game, and it can substitute for the three main characters. With this bright green Wild symbol, you can win big and expand over several positions on the reel. Furthermore, the expanding Wild can replace any symbol except for the bonus symbols.\n\nFree Spins\n\nYou can play this game's three Free Spin Bonus rounds when one of the racing cars with Elephant, Wolf, or Rabbit lands on the green point on the map. During the Free Spins, the character symbols become even more active, resulting in more frequent payouts. Winning combinations corresponding to one of the three animals will form to make the game even more exciting.\n\nMap feature\n\nThe Map feature is triggered whenever one of the character symbols appears during the winning combination in the base game. The racing cars with Wolf, Elephant, or Rabbit will move one point for each of the triggering character symbols. If there are multiple directions, the choice will be made entirely randomly.

For all the details, continue reading here!\n\nWhat are the gameplay features of Loony Blox?\n\nThis game has 5 reels and 243 paylines with high volatility and an RTP of 98.02%. The visually appealing graphics, big prizes won with winning combinations, and the Jackpot amount, which offers a maximum of 1000x bets, make Loony Blox a truly enjoyable casino entertainment. Expanding Wilds, Free Spin feature, and high and low symbols complete the offer of this cartoon slot.\n\nWhich symbols pay the most?\n\nCactus Wild is the highest-paid Wild symbol that appears during all of Habanero's slot game features and can substitute for the three main characters: Elephant, Rabbit, and Wolf. They appear on the screen for up to 250 spins until Cactus Wild replaces them. For example, if an Elephant is visible on the screen, then Cactus Wild will act as an expanding Wild and cover all positions on the reel. When Wolf appears, your chances of winning double. The Rabbit symbol helps you stop a random spin if it appears on 2 to 5 reels.\n\nHow does Loony Box's Map work?\n\nThis feature is activated if one of the character symbols appears during the winning combination in the base game. In the Map feature, the racing cars with Wolf, Elephant, or Rabbit will move one point for each of the triggering character symbols. Cactus Wild is not used in the activation combination. If there are multiple directions available, the choice will be made entirely randomly.\n\nWhat is the Loony Box Free Spin Feature?\n\nIf one of the racing cars with Elephant, Wolf, or Rabbit lands on the green point, then you receive 12 Free Spins. Running on a map that reminds us a bit of Mario Kart, when you land, combinations corresponding to one of the 3 animals will form. The start of the racing cars then activates the character symbols during the duration of the free games.\n\nWhy choose the registration-free slot Loony Blox?\n\nThe cartoon factor combined with fun and carefree gameplay represent the winning combo of this no-download slot available in one of our best AAMS-ADM casinos selected for you by our team of online slot enthusiasts.
