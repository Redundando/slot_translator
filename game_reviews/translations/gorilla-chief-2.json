Grazie alla slot machine online Gorilla Chief 2 puoi trovare pane per i tuoi denti! Parliamo di un titolo che ha una struttura molto solida, con 5 rulli su 4 linee e 50 payline. Offre la funzione di autoplay per lasciare che il gioco scorra in autonomia, collezionando vincite senza dover fare nulla. Il giocatore potrà fermare questa modalità per modificare la sua puntata. Le scommesse infatti spaziano da 0,40 centesimi fino a un massimo di 200,00 euro. Vediamo insieme quali sono le caratteristiche di questo gameplay, i dettagli della grafica e soprattutto i bonus di gioco che offrono.\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nPrima nota di merito di questo titolo firmato dalla software house WMS è la sua grafica estremamente vivace. Lo sfondo è dato da una bellissima immagine della giungla, habitat naturale in cui domina la scena il nostro affascinante e possente gorilla. Ovviamente non è il solo animale che incontreremo in questo lungo viaggio affascinante, perché sui rulli si alterneranno altri simboli come un  tramonto, scelto come Bonus, il gorilla, il ghepardo, la farfalla, l’uccello, i pappagalli, i fiori, le banane, il volto del gorilla che è anche l’icona Wild e molto altro ancora.\nLo scopo principale è quello di allinearne almeno 3 simboli uguali da sinistra a destra, sfruttando soprattutto il Wild che aiuta a sostituisce tutte le icone, fatta eccezione dello Scatter/Bonus. Se questo appare sul tabellone di gioco, sui primi 3 rulli apre la possibilità di conquistare giri gratuiti. Quando si è nei 10 free spin, si potranno ottenere altri 10 giri e usare la funzione casuale di re-spin “Hot Hot Super Respin”. Questo è il secondo pezzo forte, che si attiva sia nel bonus game che quando si è nel gioco base. Il giocatore potrà ottenere ottime vincite con extra-Wild che sono aggiunti alle bobine e restano bloccati i Wild dove atterrano.\nNon dimentichiamo poi i simboli regolari che hanno un alto: sono il Gorilla, il Gorilla Baby e il Ghepardo. Quelli che invece pagano meno sono le Banane, le Bacche e i Fiori. In tutta questa avventurosa esperienza nella giungla ricordiamo che la slot machine ha un RTP pari al 96,01%, che se si aggiunge ai giri extra permette di conquistare ottime vittorie.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Gorilla Chief 2\nC’è qualcosa che non convince della slot Gorilla Chief 2? E’ davvero difficile trovare qualcosa che non vada. Tutto sembra ben strutturato e pensato per offrire il massimo del divertimento a prescindere dall’esperienza di gioco del gamer. Tra free spin, “Hot Hot Super Respin” e simboli vincenti è praticamente impossibile annoiarsi. In assoluto la funzione extra appena citata è quella che, nella totale casualità, può riservare vincite grandi e massima soddisfazione. Durante la “Hot Hot Super Respin” un giocatore si trova con un primo rullo dotato di simboli che sono bloccati e impilati, mentre si realizzano 2 re-spin e i simboli Wild o tutti quelli che sono uguali alle icone del primo rullo restano bloccati.\n",

It offers the autoplay function, allowing the game to collect wins automatically without any input from the player. The player can stop this mode to adjust their bet, as bets range from €0.40 to a maximum of €200. Let's review the gameplay features, graphic details, and especially the bonus features it offers.\n\nGraphics and Symbols\nOne notable aspect of this game, developed by the software house WMS, is its extremely vivid graphics. The background is a beautiful image of the jungle, the natural habitat of our captivating and powerful gorilla, who dominates the scene. Of course, he is not the only animal we will encounter on this fascinating journey.

If the Scatter/Bonus appears on the game board, on the first 3 reels, it opens up the possibility of winning free spins. In the 10 free spins mode, players can obtain an additional 10 spins and use the random re-spin function \"Hot Hot Super Respin\".

Players can achieve significant wins with extra-Wilds being added to the reels and Wilds that remain blocked where they land.\n\nLet's not forget the regular symbols with a high payout: the Gorilla, the Baby Gorilla, and the Cheetah. Those with the lowest payout are the Bananas, the Berries, and the Flowers. Throughout this adventurous jungle experience, the slot machine has an RTP of 96.01%, which combined with the extra spins, leads to excellent wins.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Gorilla Chief 2 Slot\nIs there anything about Gorilla Chief 2 Slot that is not convincing? It is really hard to find anything wrong! Everything seems well-structured and designed to provide maximum entertainment regardless of the player's gambling experience. With free spins, \"Hot Hot Super Respin\", and winning symbols, it is practically impossible to get bored. The aforementioned extra feature is the one that, in complete randomness, can offer large wins and maximum satisfaction. During \"Hot Hot Super Respin\", the player has the first reel with locked and stacked symbols, while 2 re-spins are made, and Wild symbols or all others that match the first reel's icons remain blocked.\n            ",

With 5 reels, 4 lines, and a whopping 50 paylines, this game offers players an autoplay function that makes it so easy, even your grandma could play (but you didn't hear it from me). Now, we know that betting options can be a touchy subject, but we guarantee that with options ranging from a measly €0.40 all the way up to a whopping €200 - there's an option for every budget!</p> <p>The key to winning is to align at least three identical symbols from the left to right - that's right, folks - it's as easy as 1,2,3. But don't worry, if you get stuck, the Wild is there to help you out by substituting all icons except for the elusive Scatter/Bonus. Speaking of the Scatter/Bonus - if it shows up on the board on the first 3 reels, the game will give you an extra chance to win with a round of free spins. Let's face it, who doesn't love something for free, am I right?</p>\"\n}"

The betting options range from €0.40 to a maximum of €200. The objective is to align at least 3 identical symbols from left to right, making use of the Wild that substitutes all icons except for the Scatter/Bonus. If the Scatter/Bonus appears on the game board, on the first 3 reels, it opens up the possibility of winning free spins.\n\nSymbols and Design\n\nDeveloped by the software house WMS, Gorilla Chief 2 has extremely vivid graphics, with a beautiful image of the jungle as the background. The symbols include the gorilla, a sunset as the Bonus, the cheetah, the butterfly, the bird, the parrots, the flowers, the bananas, and others. The Wild symbol is the gorilla face, and the Scatter/Bonus symbol appears on the first 3 reels.\n\nBonus Features and Free Spins\n\nGorilla Chief 2 offers the chance to win free spins if the Scatter/Bonus symbol appears on the first 3 reels. In the 10 free spins mode, players can obtain an additional 10 spins and use the random re-spin function \"Hot Hot Super Respin\". This is the second special feature which is activated in both the bonus game and the base game. Players can achieve significant wins with extra-Wilds being added to the reels and Wilds that remain blocked where they land.\n\nBetting Options and Range\n\nPlayers can bet on Gorilla Chief 2 anywhere from €0.40 to a maximum of €200.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP) Percentage\n\nThroughout this adventurous jungle experience, the slot machine has an RTP of 96.01%, which combined with the extra spins, leads to excellent wins.\n\n        \n            ",

Look no further than Gorilla Chief 2 online slot machine! This game has a solid structure, with 5 reels, 4 lines, and 50 paylines. It offers the autoplay function, allowing the game to collect wins automatically without any input from the player. The player can stop this mode to adjust their bet, as bets range from €0.40 to a maximum of €200. Let's review the gameplay features, graphic details, and especially the bonus features it offers.\n\nGraphics and Symbols\nOne notable aspect of this game, developed by the software house WMS, is its extremely vivid graphics. The background is a beautiful image of the jungle, the natural habitat of our captivating and powerful gorilla, who dominates the scene. Of course, he is not the only animal we will encounter on this fascinating journey. The reels will display other symbols including a sunset, chosen as the Bonus, the gorilla, the cheetah, the butterfly, the bird, the parrots, the flowers, the bananas, and the gorilla face, which is also the Wild icon, among others.\n\nThe main objective is to align at least 3 identical symbols from left to right, making use of the Wild that substitutes all icons except for the Scatter/Bonus. If the Scatter/Bonus appears on the game board, on the first 3 reels, it opens up the possibility of winning free spins.

This is the second special feature which is activated in both the bonus game and the base game. Players can achieve significant wins with extra-Wilds being added to the reels and Wilds that remain blocked where they land.\n\nLet's not forget the regular symbols with a high payout: the Gorilla, the Baby Gorilla, and the Cheetah. Those with the lowest payout are the Bananas, the Berries, and the Flowers. Throughout this adventurous jungle experience, the slot machine has an RTP of 96.01%, which combined with the extra spins, leads to excellent wins.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Gorilla Chief 2 Slot\nIs there anything about Gorilla Chief 2 Slot that is not convincing? It is really hard to find anything wrong! Everything seems well-structured and designed to provide maximum entertainment regardless of the player's gambling experience. With free spins, \"Hot Hot Super Respin\", and winning symbols, it is practically impossible to get bored.

During \"Hot Hot Super Respin\", the player has the first reel with locked and stacked symbols, while 2 re-spins are made, and Wild symbols or all others that match the first reel's icons remain blocked.\n            ",

Look no further than Gorilla Chief 2 online slot machine! This game has a solid structure, with 5 reels, 4 lines, and 50 paylines. It offers the autoplay function, allowing the game to collect wins automatically without any input from the player. The player can stop this mode to adjust their bet, as bets range from €0.40 to a maximum of €200. Let's review the gameplay features, graphic details, and especially the bonus features it offers.\n\nGraphics and Symbols\nOne notable aspect of this game, developed by the software house WMS, is its extremely vivid graphics. The background is a beautiful image of the jungle, the natural habitat of our captivating and powerful gorilla, who dominates the scene. Of course, he is not the only animal we will encounter on this fascinating journey. The reels will display other symbols including a sunset, chosen as the Bonus, the gorilla, the cheetah, the butterfly, the bird, the parrots, the flowers, the bananas, and the gorilla face, which is also the Wild icon, among others.\n\nThe main objective is to align at least 3 identical symbols from left to right, making use of the Wild that substitutes all icons except for the Scatter/Bonus. If the Scatter/Bonus appears on the game board, on the first 3 reels, it opens up the possibility of winning free spins. In the 10 free spins mode, players can obtain an additional 10 spins and use the random re-spin function \"Hot Hot Super Respin\". This is the second special feature which is activated in both the bonus game and the base game. Players can achieve significant wins with extra-Wilds being added to the reels and Wilds that remain blocked where they land.\n\nLet's not forget the regular symbols with a high payout: the Gorilla, the Baby Gorilla, and the Cheetah. Those with the lowest payout are the Bananas, the Berries, and the Flowers. Throughout this adventurous jungle experience, the slot machine has an RTP of 96.01%, which combined with the extra spins, leads to excellent wins.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Gorilla Chief 2 Slot\nIs there anything about Gorilla Chief 2 Slot that is not convincing? It is really hard to find anything wrong! Everything seems well-structured and designed to provide maximum entertainment regardless of the player's gambling experience. With free spins, \"Hot Hot Super Respin\", and winning symbols, it is practically impossible to get bored. The aforementioned extra feature is the one that, in complete randomness, can offer large wins and maximum satisfaction. During \"Hot Hot Super Respin\", the player has the first reel with locked and stacked symbols, while 2 re-spins are made, and Wild symbols or all others that match the first reel's icons remain blocked.\n        ",
