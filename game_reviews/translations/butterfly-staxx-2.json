This greater number of symbols per play also increases the number of combinations obtainable.\n\nIn fact, we're talking about forty win lines with an estimated RTP (as it can vary substantially in the short term) of 96.35%.\n\nWhich symbols should we keep an eye on? The purple orchid is a Wild symbol and as such can replace any other normal symbol in composing the various combinations (we're talking about a Joker).\n\nThe golden butterfly, instead, allows access to free spins. This function, very common in slots, takes a slightly different form than usual: if the two reels to the left are covered with golden butterflies, a second game grid will be obtained during this mode. If the reels to the left of the second grid are covered, a third grid will be obtained. Needless to say, having more grids available exponentially increases the chances of winning.\n\nSlots similar to Butterfly Staxx 2\nIf you liked this slot machine and want to try some similar games, we can recommend a few titles. Also from NetEnt, with a natural and relaxed style, we have Trolls and Evolution. Of course, every slot is different from another, but in general, NetEnt prides itself on using many dreamlike elements within its own games, as is the case with Fairytale Legends.\n\nIf, on the other hand, we're looking for a slot still with a floral theme, we can suggest Jade Butterfly from Pragmatic Play.\n        ",

The purple orchid is a Wild symbol and as such can replace any other normal symbol in composing the various combinations (we're talking about a Joker).\n\nThe golden butterfly, instead, allows access to free spins. This function, very common in slots, takes a slightly different form than usual: if the two reels to the left are covered with golden butterflies, a second game grid will be obtained during this mode. If the reels to the left of the second grid are covered, a third grid will be obtained. Needless to say, having more grids available exponentially increases the chances of winning.\n\nSlots similar to Butterfly Staxx 2\nIf you liked this slot machine and want to try some similar games, we can recommend a few titles. Also from NetEnt, with a natural and relaxed style, we have Trolls and Evolution. Of course, every slot is different from another, but in general, NetEnt prides itself on using many dreamlike elements within its own games, as is the case with Fairytale Legends.\n\nIf, on the other hand, we're looking for a slot still with a floral theme, we can suggest Jade Butterfly from Pragmatic Play.\n            ",

Often, mythological creatures that somehow appeal to wealth and treasure are used. Just think of how overused dragons are in the world of slots, or phoenixes that represent the hope of rebirth, much like what can come from a sudden win.\n\nNetEnt, with the Butterfly Staxx 2 slot, moves in a different direction: not a proud and fierce animal like the dragon, but the fleeting and ethereal beauty of butterflies, in a slot that aims to both entertain and relax the player.\n\nGraphics of the slot machine\nBefore we get to the main topic of our review, where we'll talk about the functions and bonuses that can be found within this slot, let's take a moment to appreciate the graphical and musical side of NetEnt's Butterfly Staxx 2.\n\nAfter all, as we often say, the eye (and ear) also wants its share: a slot may have interesting functions, but if it turns out to be an unplayable cacophony, these functions are secondary.\n\nButterfly Staxx 2 welcomes us with a gentle atmospheric music, immediately immersing us in the floral expanse that makes up the symbols of the slot. The music itself, unlike other similar games, does not stop when the reels are spinning, but rather the reels themselves adapt to the relaxing atmosphere of the slot.\n\nIn fact, the sound of the reels is just a tinkling, along which it's possible to find the classic symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q, J...) as well as butterflies and various flowers.\n\nA slot that stands out from the crowd for its ability to not shout in the player's ears, but to relax them after a long day at work.\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the slot\nLet's move on to what interests us most: from a technical point of view, what kind of slot are we dealing with?\n\nNetEnt's Butterfly Staxx 2 uses a 5x4 game grid, slightly different from the more common 5x3. What's the difference between these two? Firstly, in each round, we'll be shown twenty symbols instead of the classic fifteen. This greater number of symbols per play also increases the number of combinations obtainable.\n\nIn fact, we're talking about forty win lines with an estimated RTP (as it can vary substantially in the short term) of 96.35%.\n\nWhich symbols should we keep an eye on? The purple orchid is a Wild symbol and as such can replace any other normal symbol in composing the various combinations (we're talking about a Joker).\n\nThe golden butterfly, instead, allows access to free spins. This function, very common in slots, takes a slightly different form than usual: if the two reels to the left are covered with golden butterflies, a second game grid will be obtained during this mode. If the reels to the left of the second grid are covered, a third grid will be obtained. Needless to say, having more grids available exponentially increases the chances of winning.\n\nSlots similar to Butterfly Staxx 2\nIf you liked this slot machine and want to try some similar games, we can recommend a few titles. Also from NetEnt, with a natural and relaxed style, we have Trolls and Evolution. Of course, every slot is different from another, but in general, NetEnt prides itself on using many dreamlike elements within its own games, as is the case with Fairytale Legends.\n\nIf, on the other hand, we're looking for a slot still with a floral theme, we can suggest Jade Butterfly from Pragmatic Play.\n            ",

Often, mythological creatures that somehow appeal to wealth and treasure are used. Just think of how overused dragons are in the world of slots, or phoenixes that represent the hope of rebirth, much like what can come from a sudden win.\n\nNetEnt, with the Butterfly Staxx 2 slot, moves in a different direction: not a proud and fierce animal like the dragon, but the fleeting and ethereal beauty of butterflies, in a slot that aims to both entertain and relax the player.\n\nGraphics of the slot machine\nBefore we get to the main topic of our review, where we'll talk about the functions and bonuses that can be found within this slot, let's take a moment to appreciate the graphical and musical side of NetEnt's Butterfly Staxx 2.\n\nAfter all, as we often say, the eye (and ear) also wants its share: a slot may have interesting functions, but if it turns out to be an unplayable cacophony, these functions are secondary.\n\nButterfly Staxx 2 welcomes us with a gentle atmospheric music, immediately immersing us in the floral expanse that makes up the symbols of the slot. The music itself, unlike other similar games, does not stop when the reels are spinning, but rather the reels themselves adapt to the relaxing atmosphere of the slot.\n\nIn fact, the sound of the reels is just a tinkling, along which it's possible to find the classic symbols of playing cards (A, K, Q, J...) as well as butterflies and various flowers.\n\nA slot that stands out from the crowd for its ability to not shout in the player's ears, but to relax them after a long day at work.\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the slot\nLet's move on to what interests us most: from a technical point of view, what kind of slot are we dealing with?\n\nNetEnt's Butterfly Staxx 2 uses a 5x4 game grid, slightly different from the more common 5x3. What's the difference between these two? Firstly, in each round, we'll be shown twenty symbols instead of the classic fifteen. This greater number of symbols per play also increases the number of combinations obtainable.\n\nIn fact, we're talking about forty win lines with an estimated RTP (as it can vary substantially in the short term) of 96.35%.\n\nWhich symbols should we keep an eye on? The purple orchid is a Wild symbol and as such can replace any other normal symbol in composing the various combinations (we're talking about a Joker).\n\nThe golden butterfly, instead, allows access to free spins. This function, very common in slots, takes a slightly different form than usual: if the two reels to the left are covered with golden butterflies, a second game grid will be obtained during this mode. If the reels to the left of the second grid are covered, a third grid will be obtained. Needless to say, having more grids available exponentially increases the chances of winning.\n\nSlots similar to Butterfly Staxx 2\nIf you liked this slot machine and want to try some similar games, we can recommend a few titles. Also from NetEnt, with a natural and relaxed style, we have Trolls and Evolution. Of course, every slot is different from another, but in general, NetEnt prides itself on using many dreamlike elements within its own games, as is the case with Fairytale Legends.\n\nIf, on the other hand, we're looking for a slot still with a floral theme, we can suggest Jade Butterfly from Pragmatic Play.\n            ",
