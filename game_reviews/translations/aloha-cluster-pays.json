Visually stunning, this game boasts an exceptional aesthetic with a white sandy beach backdrop, a distant volcano, and colorful flowers and palm trees. You will also find the Tiki sculpture, a religious symbol of Hawaiian culture, on the side of your screen. Immerse yourself in the authentic sounds of Hawaii, which accompanied by the vibrant graphics will have you feeling as if you're truly on the island.\n\nThis slot game stands out from the rest with its unconventional gameplay - it has six reels instead of the usual five, offering incredible chances of winning. Furthermore, the total betting range varies from a minimum of €0.10 to a maximum of €200, making it ideal for both casual players and high rollers.\n\nWith an RTP of 96.4%, Aloha! Cluster Pays has medium to low volatility and variability, which means that while the payouts are not huge, they come up frequently.\n\nAll the symbols are in line with the Hawaiian theme, and you won't find any traditional playing cards. The reels are adorned with pineapples, pink flowers, turquoise seashells, and Tiki sculptures in various colors and expressions. The game features both a Wild symbol and a Scatter symbol.\n\nAloha! Cluster Pays has an unusual gameplay experience as it does not rely on aligning symbols from left to right but on clustering of symbols for a win. Therefore, to score a win, you need to cluster between 9 to 30 symbols. If the cluster is not large enough for a win, it remains stuck on the reels to increase the chances of a lucky cluster on the next spin.\n\nThe game also features a unique free spins mechanism that excludes lower-paying symbols like flowers and shells, thereby increasing the odds of a larger and more lucrative win. To improve your chances of winning, you can use the Wild symbol to replace any other symbol in the game. Overall, Aloha! Cluster Pays is an exciting and vibrant slot game that is sure to transport you to a tropical paradise.",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and rules\n\nAloha! Cluster Pays has six reels and five rows of symbols instead of the traditional five reels. The game features Aloha Cluster Pays, which means that the symbols don't have to be aligned from left to right. They can appear anywhere on the reels, but they must be in clusters of at least nine symbols to count for a win. The betting range varies from a minimum of €0.10 to a maximum of €200, making it ideal for both casual players and high rollers.\n\nVisual design and theme\n\nAloha! Cluster Pays has an excellent aesthetic design with a backdrop of a white sandy beach, a volcano, and colorful flowers and palm trees of Hawaii. The Tiki sculpture, a religious symbol of Hawaiian culture, is also on the side of your screen. The reels are adorned with various symbols such as pineapples, pink flowers, turquoise seashells, and Tiki sculptures in various colors and expressions. The game's sounds are authentic to Hawaii and perfectly complement the excellent graphics, making you feel as if you're on the island.\n\nFree spins mechanism\n\nAloha! Cluster Pays has a unique free spins mechanism that excludes low-paying symbols like flowers and seashells, increasing your chances of landing a higher payout. The free spins are activated when you land three or more Scatter symbols. You'll receive between 9 and 12 free spins depending on the number of Scatters you land. In the free spins round, the game adds a symbol drop mechanic, where lower-paying symbols are removed from the reels after each spin. You can re-trigger up to a maximum of 60 free spins.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nAloha! Cluster Pays has a 96.4% RTP, which means that the game has a medium to low volatility and variability. It implies that the payouts are not significant, but they come up frequently. The game's low variance is suitable for players who prefer to play it safe and have a more extended playtime. It is not ideal for players who enjoy high-risk games with significant payouts.\n\nWild and Scatter symbols\n\nAloha! Cluster Pays features both a Wild and a Scatter symbol. The Wild symbol is the Tiki Mask, which can replace any other symbol in the game, increasing your chances of creating a winning combination. The Scatter symbol is the postage stamp, which activates the free spins round when you land three or more of them. The game's symbols are all in line with the Hawaiian theme, and you won't find any traditional playing cards.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics\n\nAloha! Cluster Pays is a six-reel game that adopts an unusual gameplay style. Instead of aligning symbols from left to right like other games, Aloha! Cluster Pays uses a clustering feature to score wins. The player wins when they cluster between 9 to 30 symbols, and the cluster remains on the reels to increase the player's chances of a lucky cluster on the next spin.\n\nVisuals\n\nNetEnt has created an excellent visual experience that transports players to a tropical paradise. The backdrop of the game is a white sandy beach, a distant volcano, colorful flowers, and palm trees. A Tiki sculpture, a religious symbol of Hawaiian culture, is visible on the side of the screen. The graphics are vibrant with beautiful pineapples, pink flowers, turquoise seashells, and Tiki sculptures in various colors and expressions.\n\nFree Spins Mechanism\n\nAloha! Cluster Pays uses a unique free spins mechanism. During free spins, only higher-paying symbols like Tiki masks and pineapples appear, while lower-paying symbols like flowers and shells are excluded. This increases the player's chances of a larger and more lucrative win.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nWith an RTP of 96.4%, Aloha! Cluster Pays has medium to low volatility and variability. The payouts are not huge but come up frequently, making it ideal for players who want to play for longer durations without placing significant bets. The total betting range varies from a minimum of €0.10 to a maximum of €200, catering to both casual and high rollers.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nAloha! Cluster Pays features both a Wild symbol and a Scatter symbol. The Wild symbol can replace any other symbol in the game, improving the player's chances of winning. The Scatter symbol is not only used to trigger free spins, but it also rewards players with additional free spins during the feature's infinite re-trigger mode.\n\n        \n            ",

Cluster Pays\".\n\n        Please provide a detailed prompt for DALLE to create a feature image fitting the game\n        \n        - The image should be in cartoon style\n        - The should feature a happy Maya warrior with glasses\n\n        Review: Aloha! Cluster Pays is a dynamic slot game designed by NetEnt that will transport you to the crystal clear waters of Hawaii. Visually stunning, this game boasts an exceptional aesthetic with a white sandy beach backdrop, a distant volcano, and colorful flowers and palm trees. You will also find the Tiki sculpture, a religious symbol of Hawaiian culture, on the side of your screen. Immerse yourself in the authentic sounds of Hawaii, which accompanied by the vibrant graphics will have you feeling as if you're truly on the island.\n\nThis slot game stands out from the rest with its unconventional gameplay - it has six reels instead of the usual five, offering incredible chances of winning. Furthermore, the total betting range varies from a minimum of €0.10 to a maximum of €200, making it ideal for both casual players and high rollers.\n\nWith an RTP of 96.4%, Aloha! Cluster Pays has medium to low volatility and variability, which means that while the payouts are not huge, they come up frequently.\n\nAll the symbols are in line with the Hawaiian theme, and you won't find any traditional playing cards. The reels are adorned with pineapples, pink flowers, turquoise seashells, and Tiki sculptures in various colors and expressions. The game features both a Wild symbol and a Scatter symbol.\n\nAloha! Cluster Pays has an unusual gameplay experience as it does not rely on aligning symbols from left to right but on clustering of symbols for a win. Therefore, to score a win, you need to cluster between 9 to 30 symbols. If the cluster is not large enough for a win, it remains stuck on the reels to increase the chances of a lucky cluster on the next spin.\n\nThe game also features a unique free spins mechanism that excludes lower-paying symbols like flowers and shells, thereby increasing the odds of a larger and more lucrative win. To improve your chances of winning, you can use the Wild symbol to replace any other symbol in the game. Overall, Aloha! Cluster Pays is an exciting and vibrant slot game that is sure to transport you to a tropical paradise.\n        ",
