This is one of the longest-lasting WMS slots, offering great attention to both technical and visual details. With a game board consisting of 5 reels and 40 paylines, players will be able to immerse themselves in the legendary tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. This historical title draws inspiration from prestigious legends such as those of Camelot, a constant source of inspiration for games, series, and films. Below we will reveal its strengths, the winning symbols, and most importantly, the bonus games offered by this slot machine.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nThe software house has devoted itself heart and soul to the creation of this slot game which, in terms of aesthetics and design, is very well done. We find ourselves in an enchanted forest where we encounter some of the most important characters. Among them, Lancelot, King Arthur's favorite, is the star of this game adventure. Even more enjoyable are the symbols chosen for the reels: we have weapons and characters that clearly draw on medieval heroes. Behind this great graphic effort, there is a flaw in terms of sound, as the musical accompaniment is left somewhat to chance, though sufficient for the final effect.\n\n\nThroughout the gameplay, the most prominent figures are Guinevere and Lancelot, who are also significant in size compared to the other symbols, as soon as they appear on the reel. It is these two characters that guarantee a higher payout, being chosen as Wild symbols, followed closely by Merlin. Players can take advantage of the game lines and select the ones they want to keep active: at this point, they can bet starting from a minimum of 0.01 up to a maximum of 5€. Using the autoplay mode, they can observe the various automatic plays, accumulating a prize that is increasingly substantial. With the quick bet formula, players can decide to set the amount with a simple click, ranging from 0.40 up to a maximum of 200€. The goal is therefore to use the Wild symbols to increase winnings without spending or losing anything. However, there are no Scatter symbols in the game.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the absence of bonus games is disappointing, although the free spins can be easily activated. With 2 stacked Wild symbols, players get 5 free spins, up to a maximum of 50 spins with 5 Wild symbols.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Lancelot Slot\n\nOverall, the online slot machine Lancelot offers a positive gaming experience, even if there are some missing parts that make it a beautiful retro-style title. The management of free spins is effortless, but the absence of a bonus game to increase the fun of the game and player entertainment is quite disappointing. Nonetheless, it is still a great title to try both on a computer and on a smartphone or tablet, giving players total freedom!",

This is one of the longest-lasting WMS slots, offering great attention to both technical and visual details. With a game board consisting of 5 reels and 40 paylines, players will be able to immerse themselves in the legendary tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. This historical title draws inspiration from prestigious legends such as those of Camelot, a constant source of inspiration for games, series, and films. Below we will reveal its strengths, the winning symbols, and most importantly, the bonus games offered by this slot machine.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nThe software house has devoted itself heart and soul to the creation of this slot game which, in terms of aesthetics and design, is very well done. We find ourselves in an enchanted forest where we encounter some of the most important characters. Among them, Lancelot, King Arthur's favorite, is the star of this game adventure. Even more enjoyable are the symbols chosen for the reels: we have weapons and characters that clearly draw on medieval heroes. Behind this great graphic effort, there is a flaw in terms of sound, as the musical accompaniment is left somewhat to chance, though sufficient for the final effect.\n\n\nThroughout the gameplay, the most prominent figures are Guinevere and Lancelot, who are also significant in size compared to the other symbols, as soon as they appear on the reel. It is these two characters that guarantee a higher payout, being chosen as Wild symbols, followed closely by Merlin. Players can take advantage of the game lines and select the ones they want to keep active: at this point, they can bet starting from a minimum of 0.01 up to a maximum of 5€. Using the autoplay mode, they can observe the various automatic plays, accumulating a prize that is increasingly substantial. With the quick bet formula, players can decide to set the amount with a simple click, ranging from 0.40 up to a maximum of 200€. The goal is therefore to use the Wild symbols to increase winnings without spending or losing anything. However, there are no Scatter symbols in the game.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the absence of bonus games is disappointing, although the free spins can be easily activated. With 2 stacked Wild symbols, players get 5 free spins, up to a maximum of 50 spins with 5 Wild symbols.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Lancelot Slot\n\nOverall, the online slot machine Lancelot offers a positive gaming experience, even if there are some missing parts that make it a beautiful retro-style title. The management of free spins is effortless, but the absence of a bonus game to increase the fun of the game and player entertainment is quite disappointing. Nonetheless, it is still a great title to try both on a computer and on a smartphone or tablet, giving players total freedom!\n            ",

The game doesn't offer a bonus game, but free spins can be activated with 2 stacked Wild symbols, up to a maximum of 50 free spins with 5 Wild symbols.\n\nGraphics\n\nLancelot benefits from high-quality graphics and attention to detail. The game takes place in an enchanted forest and features medieval symbols and characters, with Lancelot, Guinevere, and Merlin being the most prominent figures. However, the game's sound is somewhat lackluster.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols in Lancelot draw inspiration from medieval folklore and include weapons and characters from the legendary tales. Guinevere and Lancelot are the Wild symbols and offer higher payouts, alongside Merlin.\n\nBonuses\n\nLancelot doesn't offer a bonus game, which may be disappointing for some players. However, free spins can be activated with 2 stacked Wild symbols, up to a maximum of 50 free spins with 5 Wild symbols.\n\nOverall Experience\n\nLancelot is an enjoyable online slot game that offers a positive gaming experience. However, with no bonus game and lackluster sound, it may not be for everyone. Still, the game's attention to detail and high-quality graphics make it worth a try.\n\n        \n            ",

The game offers players the choice to select the active lines and bet from a range of 0.01 to 5€. Using the autoplay mode and quick bet formula, players can accumulate substantial winnings. However, the absence of bonus games is disappointing, and there are no Scatter symbols in the game.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics of Lancelot are exceptional. WMS has devoted itself to creating a game with high-quality visuals to portray the enchanted forest setting, the medieval heroes, and the significant characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere, who are also chosen as Wild symbols. However, there is a shortcoming in terms of sound, as the accompanying music is mediocre, though sufficient to create an overall enjoyable effect.\n\nPaylines\n\nLancelot has 5 reels and 40 paylines, with players able to choose which paylines they want to keep active. The minimum bet is 0.01, and the maximum bet is 5€. The autoplay mode allows for the automatic plays to accumulate winnings, while the quick bet formula enables players to select the amount with a simple click, ranging from 0.40 up to a maximum of 200€.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols chosen for the reels of Lancelot draw on medieval heroes to add to the legendary atmosphere. The most prominent figures throughout the gameplay are Lancelot and Guinevere, who are also chosen as Wild symbols, with Merlin closely following. When these symbols appear on the reel, they guarantee a higher payout. However, there are no Scatter symbols in the game.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe absence of a bonus game is a shortcoming of Lancelot, though the free spins feature can be easily activated. Two stacked Wild symbols award players with 5 free spins, while 5 stacked Wild symbols could result in a maximum of 50 free spins. Although the free spins feature can lead to substantial payouts, the lack of bonus rounds to increase the entertainment and fun of the game is disappointing.\n\n        \n            ",

This is one of the longest-lasting WMS slots, offering great attention to both technical and visual details. With a game board consisting of 5 reels and 40 paylines, players will be able to immerse themselves in the legendary tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. This historical title draws inspiration from prestigious legends such as those of Camelot, a constant source of inspiration for games, series, and films. Below we will reveal its strengths, the winning symbols, and most importantly, the bonus games offered by this slot machine.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nThe software house has devoted itself heart and soul to the creation of this slot game which, in terms of aesthetics and design, is very well done. We find ourselves in an enchanted forest where we encounter some of the most important characters. Among them, Lancelot, King Arthur's favorite, is the star of this game adventure. Even more enjoyable are the symbols chosen for the reels: we have weapons and characters that clearly draw on medieval heroes. Behind this great graphic effort, there is a flaw in terms of sound, as the musical accompaniment is left somewhat to chance, though sufficient for the final effect.\n\n\nThroughout the gameplay, the most prominent figures are Guinevere and Lancelot, who are also significant in size compared to the other symbols, as soon as they appear on the reel. It is these two characters that guarantee a higher payout, being chosen as Wild symbols, followed closely by Merlin. Players can take advantage of the game lines and select the ones they want to keep active: at this point, they can bet starting from a minimum of 0.01 up to a maximum of 5€. Using the autoplay mode, they can observe the various automatic plays, accumulating a prize that is increasingly substantial. With the quick bet formula, players can decide to set the amount with a simple click, ranging from 0.40 up to a maximum of 200€. The goal is therefore to use the Wild symbols to increase winnings without spending or losing anything. However, there are no Scatter symbols in the game.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the absence of bonus games is disappointing, although the free spins can be easily activated. With 2 stacked Wild symbols, players get 5 free spins, up to a maximum of 50 spins with 5 Wild symbols.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Lancelot Slot\n\nOverall, the online slot machine Lancelot offers a positive gaming experience, even if there are some missing parts that make it a beautiful retro-style title. The management of free spins is effortless, but the absence of a bonus game to increase the fun of the game and player entertainment is quite disappointing. Nonetheless, it is still a great title to try both on a computer and on a smartphone or tablet, giving players total freedom!\n            ",
