Puoi farlo con Age of the Gods: Furious 4, la slot machine online che va ad arricchire la saga firmata da Playtech. Parliamo di una struttura che è realizzata partendo da 5 rulli e 25 linee di pagamento, con 12 giri gratuiti proposti nel caso in cui si attivi la Funzione specifica. Protagonisti di questa avventura sono 4 diverse divinità, rappresentate da Prometeo, Apollo, Pandora e Atlante. Le loro figure andranno ad alternarsi sui rulli cercando di aiutarti a collezionare combinazioni vincenti e ricchi premi. Nel momento in cui si presentano possono attribuire simboli in espansione, moltiplicatori e icone che si fissano sui rulli per aumentare le tue possibilità di vincita. E per rendere ancora più interessante il game sono previsti non uno, non due e non tre jackpot: sono quattro e possono essere vinti con un pizzico di fortuna in più.\nScopriremo di seguito le caratteristiche e le funzioni speciali di questa macchinetta online che ha una volatilità media a un RTP al 94.88%.\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nA livello grafico non c’è molto da dire: il giocatore si trova di fronte a una fitta rete di nuvole illuminate che sembrano anticipare l’accesso all’olimpo. Qui si posiziona la griglia di gioco che ci farà incontrare i personaggi della mitologia greca antica. Nel complesso l’effetto è interessante, ma nulla di indimenticabile, soprattutto perché lo stile è abbastanza classico, tipico di una slot un po’ retrò. Come detto ognuna delle 4 divinità ha un potere preciso che sarà liberato giro dopo giro sfruttando le giuste combo. Tra i simboli più fortunati c’è il Wild Furious 4 che può premiare con una ricompensa pari a 10.000 volte la tua scommessa se ne posizioni 5 su una linea di pagamento.\nLo Scatter invece, se si presenta tre o più volte sui rulli permette di attivare la funzione dei free spin: ne ottieni 12 gratuiti e potrai sfruttare delle funzionalità bonus. L’obiettivo è trovare le divinità che coprono il rullo centrale per ricevere il premio a loro assegnato. Per esempio Apollo attiva 4 giri gratuiti e può espandersi fino a ricoprire l’intero rullo, sostituendo tutti gli altri simboli fatta eccezione per quelli speciali. Prometeo invece, nella fase dei giri gratuiti, può fissarsi sui rulli permettendo di potenziare le vincite. Pandora consente di attivare un moltiplicatore per ogni volta che appare sulla griglia di gioco. E infine abbiamo Atlas che se si posiziona sul terzo rullo e attribuisce altri tre giri Age of Endurance.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Age of the Gods: Furious 4\nE i jackpot? Age of the Gods: Furious 4 offre da 1 a 4 jackpot progressivi che possono essere conquistati in ​​qualsiasi momento. Più alta è la scommessa che effettui e maggiore è la possibilità di vincita. Potrai così vincere il montepremi Power, Extra Power, Super Power o Ultimate Power: ovviamente quest’ultimo è il più importante di tutti.\nNel complesso la slot attribuisce buone vittorie grazie ai giri gratuiti ma un po’ meno nel gioco base, ha un gameplay intuitivo e divertente pur non spiccando per grafica.\n",

With five reels and 25 paylines, this game packs a punch with its 12 free spins feature. The stars of this adventure are four powerful deities – Prometheus, Apollo, Pandora, and Atlas – who take turns to grace the reels to help you collect winning combinations and big payouts. They can attribute expanding symbols, multipliers and sticky icons to help you increase your chances of winning. And to add to the excitement, this game doesn't have just one, two, or three jackpots – there are four, giving you a little extra luck in your favor.\n\nAs an experienced gambler, you know that graphics play a big role in the gaming experience. Although the graphics in Furious 4 are not groundbreaking, they are interesting enough to get you in the mood for some Greek mythology inspired gaming. The symbols include the Wild Furious 4 and the Scatter. The former can grant you a reward of up to 10,000 times your bet if you get five on a payline, while the latter allows you to trigger the free spins feature if you land three or more on the reels. During the feature, each of the four gods offers a unique bonus. For instance, Apollo can activate four free spins and can expand to cover the entire reel, replacing all other symbols except the special ones. Prometheus, on the other hand, can fixate on the reels, boosting your wins.\n\nFinally, let's talk about the jackpots. Furious 4 offers from one to four progressive jackpots, and the more you bet, the higher your chances of winning. You can walk away with the Power, Extra Power, Super Power, or Ultimate Power jackpots, with the latter being the most lucrative.\n\nIn conclusion, this slot may not wow you with its graphics, but it delivers satisfying wins, especially through the free spins feature.

You can do it with Age of the Gods: Furious 4, the online slot machine that enriches the saga signed by Playtech. This slot has 5 reels and 25 paylines, with 12 free spins offered if you activate the specific function. The protagonists of this adventure are 4 different deities, represented by Prometheus, Apollo, Pandora, and Atlas. Their figures will alternate on the reels, helping you collect winning combinations and rich prizes. When they appear, they can attribute expanding symbols, multipliers, and icons that fix on the reels to increase your chances of winning. And to make the game even more interesting, not one, not two, and not three jackpots are planned: there are four and can be won with a little more luck. \n\nNow let's discover the features and special functions of this online slot that has a medium volatility and an RTP of 94.88%. \n\nGraphics and game symbols \nFrom a graphic point of view, there is not much to say: the player is faced with a dense network of illuminated clouds that seem to anticipate access to Olympus. Here is where the game grid is located, which will introduce us to the characters of ancient Greek mythology. Overall, the effect is interesting, but not unforgettable, especially since the style is quite classic, typical of a slightly retro slot. As mentioned, each of the 4 deities has a specific power that will be released spin after spin by exploiting the right combos. Among the luckiest symbols, there is the Wild Furious 4 that can reward with a prize equal to 10,000 times your bet if you position 5 on a payline. \n\nThe Scatter, on the other hand, if it appears three or more times on the reels, allows the activation of the free spin function: you get 12 free spins and can take advantage of bonus features. The goal is to find the deities that cover the central reel to receive the prize assigned to them. For example, Apollo activates 4 free spins and can expand to cover the entire reel, replacing all other symbols except for the special ones. Prometheus, on the other hand, in the free spin phase, can fix on the reels, allowing you to enhance your winnings. Pandora allows you to activate a multiplier every time it appears on the game grid. And finally, we have Atlas, who, if positioned on the third reel, attributes three more Age of Endurance spins. \n\nFinal thoughts on the Age of the Gods: Furious 4 slot \nAnd what about the jackpots? Age of the Gods: Furious 4 offers from 1 to 4 progressive jackpots that can be won at any time. The higher the bet you place, the greater the chance of winning. You can win the Power, Extra Power, Super Power, or Ultimate Power jackpot: obviously, the latter is the most important of all. \n\nOverall, the slot awards good victories thanks to free spins but a little less in the base game. It has an intuitive and fun gameplay despite not standing out for graphics. For experienced gamblers looking for an enticing slot that combines mythology and big wins, Age of the Gods: Furious 4 is definitely worth a try.\n            ",

The game features 4 different deities - Prometheus, Apollo, Pandora, and Atlas - that appear on the reels and help to collect winning combinations and rich prizes. They can also attribute expanding symbols, multipliers, and icons that fix on the reels to increase winning chances. The Wild Furious 4 is the luckiest symbol that can reward players with a prize equal to 10,000 times their bet if positioned 5 on a payline.

You can do it with Age of the Gods: Furious 4, the online slot machine that enriches the saga signed by Playtech. This slot has 5 reels and 25 paylines, with 12 free spins offered if you activate the specific function. The protagonists of this adventure are 4 different deities, represented by Prometheus, Apollo, Pandora, and Atlas. Their figures will alternate on the reels, helping you collect winning combinations and rich prizes. When they appear, they can attribute expanding symbols, multipliers, and icons that fix on the reels to increase your chances of winning. And to make the game even more interesting, not one, not two, and not three jackpots are planned: there are four and can be won with a little more luck. \n\nNow let's discover the features and special functions of this online slot that has a medium volatility and an RTP of 94.88%. \n\nGraphics and game symbols \nFrom a graphic point of view, there is not much to say: the player is faced with a dense network of illuminated clouds that seem to anticipate access to Olympus. Here is where the game grid is located, which will introduce us to the characters of ancient Greek mythology. Overall, the effect is interesting, but not unforgettable, especially since the style is quite classic, typical of a slightly retro slot. As mentioned, each of the 4 deities has a specific power that will be released spin after spin by exploiting the right combos. Among the luckiest symbols, there is the Wild Furious 4 that can reward with a prize equal to 10,000 times your bet if you position 5 on a payline. \n\nThe Scatter, on the other hand, if it appears three or more times on the reels, allows the activation of the free spin function: you get 12 free spins and can take advantage of bonus features. The goal is to find the deities that cover the central reel to receive the prize assigned to them. For example, Apollo activates 4 free spins and can expand to cover the entire reel, replacing all other symbols except for the special ones. Prometheus, on the other hand, in the free spin phase, can fix on the reels, allowing you to enhance your winnings. Pandora allows you to activate a multiplier every time it appears on the game grid. And finally, we have Atlas, who, if positioned on the third reel, attributes three more Age of Endurance spins. \n\nFinal thoughts on the Age of the Gods: Furious 4 slot \nAnd what about the jackpots? Age of the Gods: Furious 4 offers from 1 to 4 progressive jackpots that can be won at any time. The higher the bet you place, the greater the chance of winning. You can win the Power, Extra Power, Super Power, or Ultimate Power jackpot: obviously, the latter is the most important of all. \n\nOverall, the slot awards good victories thanks to free spins but a little less in the base game. It has an intuitive and fun gameplay despite not standing out for graphics. For experienced gamblers looking for an enticing slot that combines mythology and big wins, Age of the Gods: Furious 4 is definitely worth a try.\n            ",

You can do it with Age of the Gods: Furious 4, the online slot machine that enriches the saga signed by Playtech. This slot has 5 reels and 25 paylines, with 12 free spins offered if you activate the specific function. The protagonists of this adventure are 4 different deities, represented by Prometheus, Apollo, Pandora, and Atlas. Their figures will alternate on the reels, helping you collect winning combinations and rich prizes. When they appear, they can attribute expanding symbols, multipliers, and icons that fix on the reels to increase your chances of winning. And to make the game even more interesting, not one, not two, and not three jackpots are planned: there are four and can be won with a little more luck. \n\nNow let's discover the features and special functions of this online slot that has a medium volatility and an RTP of 94.88%. \n\nGraphics and game symbols \nFrom a graphic point of view, there is not much to say: the player is faced with a dense network of illuminated clouds that seem to anticipate access to Olympus. Here is where the game grid is located, which will introduce us to the characters of ancient Greek mythology. Overall, the effect is interesting, but not unforgettable, especially since the style is quite classic, typical of a slightly retro slot. As mentioned, each of the 4 deities has a specific power that will be released spin after spin by exploiting the right combos. Among the luckiest symbols, there is the Wild Furious 4 that can reward with a prize equal to 10,000 times your bet if you position 5 on a payline. \n\nThe Scatter, on the other hand, if it appears three or more times on the reels, allows the activation of the free spin function: you get 12 free spins and can take advantage of bonus features. The goal is to find the deities that cover the central reel to receive the prize assigned to them. For example, Apollo activates 4 free spins and can expand to cover the entire reel, replacing all other symbols except for the special ones. Prometheus, on the other hand, in the free spin phase, can fix on the reels, allowing you to enhance your winnings. Pandora allows you to activate a multiplier every time it appears on the game grid. And finally, we have Atlas, who, if positioned on the third reel, attributes three more Age of Endurance spins. \n\nFinal thoughts on the Age of the Gods: Furious 4 slot \nAnd what about the jackpots? Age of the Gods: Furious 4 offers from 1 to 4 progressive jackpots that can be won at any time. The higher the bet you place, the greater the chance of winning. You can win the Power, Extra Power, Super Power, or Ultimate Power jackpot: obviously, the latter is the most important of all. \n\nOverall, the slot awards good victories thanks to free spins but a little less in the base game. It has an intuitive and fun gameplay despite not standing out for graphics. For experienced gamblers looking for an enticing slot that combines mythology and big wins, Age of the Gods: Furious 4 is definitely worth a try.\n            ",
