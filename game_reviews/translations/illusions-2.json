To win, players must land three or more consecutive symbols in a row on a winning line from left to right. The game can be played on mobile or desktop without registration.\n\nWinning symbols and paylines\n\nThe highest wins in Illusions 2 come when players get five in a row. The Assistant is the symbol that pays the most with 1,000 coins, while rabbits, flowers, and the Crystal Ball pay only 300 and 120 coins respectively for five in a row. Playing card symbols pay between 120 and 60 coins for a full line. The Wild symbols are the magician's White Gloves, which have three different multipliers (2x, 3x, and 5x) in addition to appearing without any multiplier. There is also a Scatter symbol to win a cash prize. The ILLUSIONS 2 title symbol, if landed three, four, or five times on the reels, awards 5x, 10x, or 25x the total bet. \n\nSpecial symbols and their effects\n\nIn Illusions 2, the Wild symbol is the magician's White Gloves. If players win using the Wild symbol, one of the three multipliers will come into play, giving them a bigger win than usual. The Scatter symbol is the ILLUSIONS 2 title symbol, and landing this symbol three, four, or five times on the reels will award a cash prize. Finally, there is the Magician symbol, and if it appears three or more times, the free spin feature will be activated.\n\nFree Spin feature and its options\n\nThe free spin feature in Illusions 2 can be triggered by landing the Magician symbol three or more times. Players have three options to choose from: 15 free spins without a multiplier, 8 free spins with a 3x multiplier, or 5 free spins with a 6x multiplier. One extra symbol is added to the reels during the free spins, and landing it will trigger the magician to perform a trick, leading to entire reels being filled with matching symbols on some occasions.\n\nOverall game experience and potential for big wins\n\nThe magic theme in Illusions 2 adds an element of fun to the game, with well-designed graphics. Although the playing card symbols are missing, the game offers potentially valuable multipliers for frequent big instant wins, thanks to the Wild and Scatter symbols. The free spin feature is also a great way of increasing potential winnings. Choose your favorite magic trick option and enjoy the show with its tricks and surprise prizes!\n\n        \n            ",

Get comfortable and let the dark stage light up as the most fun magic show online begins!\nDiscover the magical symbols and the spin function \nIn this slot game without downloading, the highest wins come when you get five in a row. Let's see the main symbols:\n\n-The Assistant is the symbol that pays the most with 1,000 coins,\n-Rabbits and Flowers pay only 300 coins,\n-The Crystal Ball pays only 120 for 5 in a row,\n-Playing card symbols pay between 120 and 60 coins for a full line,\n-The Wild symbols in this game are the magician's White Gloves. This wild symbol has three different multipliers randomly, with 2x, 3x, and 5x, in addition to appearing without any multiplier. If you use this wild symbol to actually win, the multiplier will come into play, giving you a much bigger win than usual.\n-There is also a Scatter symbol to win a cash prize.

There are iconic symbols such as the rabbit emerging from a hat, the crystal ball, and the assistant holding a dove, making the game very dynamic and full of surprises! Discover the magician's tricks in my review...\nExperience Illusions 2 gameplay on your mobile or desktop \nThis slot game, without registration like most other games found online, has five reels. There are 30 paylines and combinations for 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or all 30 complete lines. To win, you must land three or more consecutive symbols in a row on a winning line from left to right. The graphics are good, although while playing, one can sense the lack of having more playing card symbols on the reels. Get comfortable and let the dark stage light up as the most fun magic show online begins!\nDiscover the magical symbols and the spin function \nIn this slot game without downloading, the highest wins come when you get five in a row. Let's see the main symbols:\n\n-The Assistant is the symbol that pays the most with 1,000 coins,\n-Rabbits and Flowers pay only 300 coins,\n-The Crystal Ball pays only 120 for 5 in a row,\n-Playing card symbols pay between 120 and 60 coins for a full line,\n-The Wild symbols in this game are the magician's White Gloves. This wild symbol has three different multipliers randomly, with 2x, 3x, and 5x, in addition to appearing without any multiplier. If you use this wild symbol to actually win, the multiplier will come into play, giving you a much bigger win than usual.\n-There is also a Scatter symbol to win a cash prize. This is the ILLUSIONS 2 title symbol, and if 3, 4, or 5 appear anywhere on the reels, you will win 5x, 10x, or 25x your total bet.\n-The final symbol of the game is the same Magician, and if it appears three or more times on the reels, the free spin feature is activated.\n\nFree Spin feature: illusion or reality?\nWhen you enter this feature, you can choose from the various magic tricks you prefer, each with different spin and multiplier numbers. The choices are: 15 free spins without a multiplier, 8 free spins with a 3x multiplier, and 5 free spins with a 6x multiplier. During the free spins, an extra symbol is added to the reels, and landing one of these will see the magician perform a trick – this leads to triggering the entire reel on occasions.\nMy conclusions on the Illusions 2 slot game \nThe magic theme makes the game fun, and the graphics, although simple, are well done. The multipliers connected to the wilds can be a potentially valuable element for realizing frequent large instant wins, thanks to the additional scatter symbol. Choose your favorite magic number and let yourself be conquered by this show of tricks and surprise prizes.\n            ",
