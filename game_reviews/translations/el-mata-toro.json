Effettivamente, si tratta di una delle manifestazioni più peculiari e spettacolari della Spagna. Anche se oggi molti animalisti si oppongono a questo tipo di scene, niente ci vieta di riviverle all’interno di una Slot Machine.\nUna cosa è certa: vivere nei panni del torero che è costretto a deviare ogni volta la rincorsa del toro, è un’esperienza a suo modo elettrizzante. Se ti interessa questo tipo di spettacolo e vorresti godertelo mentre vinci un sacco di soldi, continua a leggere.\n\nUna grafica spagnoleggiante\nEl Mata Toro è una Slot Machine prodotta da CapeCod, ossia una casa di produzione per software di siti di online gambling tutta italiana. Cominciamo con il dirti che la Slot Machine di cui ti stiamo per parlare ha una grafica molto semplice, e non ha nulla a che vedere con altre Slot dagli sfondi estremamente particolari e coinvolgenti. Questa, infatti, cerca di rendere l’esperienza elettrizzante grazie all’impiego di funzioni molto remunerative.\nPer adesso, però, ti parliamo della grafica e ti diciamo che la griglia è una 5×3 in cui i simboli sono appoggiati su uno sfondo molto romantico dalla sfumatura di rosso.\nI simboli sono molto ben disegnati, soprattutto quelli del torero e della donna spagnola, che sembrano frutto di uno dei migliori film d’animazione del momento. Agli angoli della Slot ci sono mazzi di rose rosse, che rendono l’atmosfera ancora più romantica e, in un certo modo, coinvolgente. Continua a leggere per saperne di più in merito a funzioni e bonus speciali.\n\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nCome ti dicevamo, El Mata Toro, la Slot Machine a tema corrida prodotta da CapeCod, ha una classica griglia 5×3 per un totale di 25 linee di pagamento. Come sempre, CapeCod si mantiene sugli standard del mercato, non avvicinandosi nemmeno lontanamente al numero di paylines proposte nelle Slot NetEnt o Yggdrasil. Abbastanza deludente questa volta l’RTP, che si attesta sul 95,2% quando lo standard generale delle Slot Machine è del 95,5%.\nTuttavia, El Mata Toro compensa queste sue mancanze, in parte, dalla presenza di ottimi Bonus.\nDobbiamo dire che c’è sia il Wild normale che l’Expanding Wild. La differenza è che il secondo si allarga fino a prendere l’intero rullo su cui compare. In ogni caso, il suo obiettivo è quello di sostituire ogni simbolo possibile all’interno di una linea di pagamento per permetterti di ottenere una combinazione vincente.\nIl Bonus Special ti permette di sperimentare un minigioco su una Slot 3×3 in cui avrai ben 5 giri gratis. Su questa piccola slot è molto più facile ottenere moltiplicatori e via dicendo.\nIl Bonus Toro, invece, ti permette di ottenere 5 MagicSpins, con delle caratteristiche molto particolari che ti faranno vincere con più alta probabilità. Infine, moltiplicatore Mystery è rappresentato da un punto interrogativo e ti consente di moltiplicare la vincita con un 2x o un 3x.\n\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nSe ti interessa il genere della corrida, non possiamo fare altro che suggerirti Wild Toro, la Slot Machine prodotta da Elk che ti permette di vivere un’esperienza ancora più bella grazie alla sua grafica moderna e al suo numero massimo di linee di pagamento di 178!\n",

It's certainly one of Spain's most unique and spectacular events. And even though many animal rights activists oppose this type of scene today, nothing stops us from reliving it within a slot machine.\n\nOne thing is for sure: living as a bullfighter who is forced to dodge the charging bull every time is a truly electrifying experience. If you're interested in this type of spectacle and want to enjoy it while winning a lot of money, keep reading.\n\nA Spanish-Style Graphics\n\nEl Mata Toro is a slot machine produced by CapeCod, an Italian provider of software for online gambling sites. Let's start by saying that the slot machine we're going to talk about has a very simple graphics, and has nothing to do with other slots with extremely engaging and immersive backgrounds. Instead, it aims to make the experience electrifying through the use of highly rewarding functions.\n\nFor now, however, we'll talk about the graphics and tell you that the grid is a 5x3 in which the symbols are placed on a very romantic background with a shade of red. The symbols are very well designed, especially those of the bullfighter and the Spanish woman, which seem like they were taken straight out of one of the best animated films of the moment. There are bunches of red roses in the corners of the slot, which make the atmosphere even more romantic and, in a way, engaging. Keep reading to learn more about special functions and bonuses.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nAs we mentioned, El Mata Toro, the bullfighting-themed slot machine produced by CapeCod, has a classic 5x3 grid for a total of 25 paylines. As always, CapeCod stays within industry standards, not even coming close to the number of paylines offered in NetEnt or Yggdrasil slots. Quite disappointing this time is the RTP, which stands at 95.2% when the general standard for slot machines is 95.5%.\n\nHowever, El Mata Toro compensates for these shortcomings by having excellent bonuses. We must say that there is both a normal Wild and an Expanding Wild. The difference is that the latter expands to take up the entire reel on which it appears. In any case, it aims to substitute any possible symbol within a payline to allow you to obtain a winning combination.\n\nThe Special Bonus allows you to experience a mini-game on a 3x3 slot with five free spins. On this small slot, it's much easier to get multipliers and so on. The Toro Bonus, on the other hand, allows you to get five MagicSpins, with unique features that increase your chances of winning. Finally, the Mystery Multiplier is represented by a question mark and allows you to multiply your winnings by 2x or 3x.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf you're interested in the bullfighting genre, we can only suggest Wild Toro, the slot machine produced by Elk that allows you to experience an even more beautiful experience thanks to its modern graphics and its maximum number of paylines of 178!\n            ",

It's certainly one of Spain's most unique and spectacular events. And even though many animal rights activists oppose this type of scene today, nothing stops us from reliving it within a slot machine.\n\nOne thing is for sure: living as a bullfighter who is forced to dodge the charging bull every time is a truly electrifying experience. If you're interested in this type of spectacle and want to enjoy it while winning a lot of money, keep reading.\n\nA Spanish-Style Graphics\n\nEl Mata Toro is a slot machine produced by CapeCod, an Italian provider of software for online gambling sites. Let's start by saying that the slot machine we're going to talk about has a very simple graphics, and has nothing to do with other slots with extremely engaging and immersive backgrounds. Instead, it aims to make the experience electrifying through the use of highly rewarding functions.\n\nFor now, however, we'll talk about the graphics and tell you that the grid is a 5x3 in which the symbols are placed on a very romantic background with a shade of red. The symbols are very well designed, especially those of the bullfighter and the Spanish woman, which seem like they were taken straight out of one of the best animated films of the moment. There are bunches of red roses in the corners of the slot, which make the atmosphere even more romantic and, in a way, engaging. Keep reading to learn more about special functions and bonuses.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nAs we mentioned, El Mata Toro, the bullfighting-themed slot machine produced by CapeCod, has a classic 5x3 grid for a total of 25 paylines. As always, CapeCod stays within industry standards, not even coming close to the number of paylines offered in NetEnt or Yggdrasil slots. Quite disappointing this time is the RTP, which stands at 95.2% when the general standard for slot machines is 95.5%.\n\nHowever, El Mata Toro compensates for these shortcomings by having excellent bonuses. We must say that there is both a normal Wild and an Expanding Wild. The difference is that the latter expands to take up the entire reel on which it appears. In any case, it aims to substitute any possible symbol within a payline to allow you to obtain a winning combination.\n\nThe Special Bonus allows you to experience a mini-game on a 3x3 slot with five free spins. On this small slot, it's much easier to get multipliers and so on. The Toro Bonus, on the other hand, allows you to get five MagicSpins, with unique features that increase your chances of winning. Finally, the Mystery Multiplier is represented by a question mark and allows you to multiply your winnings by 2x or 3x.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nIf you're interested in the bullfighting genre, we can only suggest Wild Toro, the slot machine produced by Elk that allows you to experience an even more beautiful experience thanks to its modern graphics and its maximum number of paylines of 178!\n        ",
