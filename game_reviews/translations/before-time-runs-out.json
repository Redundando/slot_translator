The text below is a description of the slot game \"Before Time Runs Out\".\n\nBefore Time Runs Out\n\nStep into the world of fairy tales enclosed in the famous volume \"One Thousand and One Nights\" with the slot game produced by Habanero. You will experience an atmosphere that immerses you into a princely room that opens onto a starry sky and palaces with typical oriental shapes. The symbols are perfectly crafted and seem to come out of a Disney artist's pencil. The foreground grid has a frame rich in swirls and on the side is an hourglass. With a soundtrack that has a melody typical of oriental culture, the game creates a truly engaging experience.\n\nBefore Time Runs Out has 5 reels and 4 rows. Unlike many other slots, you win by creating winning combinations both horizontally and vertically. There are 15 fixed lines. Each token has a cost ranging from €0.01 to €20.00. With every spin, a part of the bet is moved into the jackpot, which can be randomly awarded. The RTP is 96.72%.\n\nMore than the base game, what sets Before Time Runs Out apart is the high number of bonuses available. There are seven regular symbols. The lower ones are copper, silver, and gold coins, while the higher ones are the scimitar, the vizier, the prince, and the princess. \n\nThe symbol of the prince and that of the vizier can give rise to duels. Depending on the winner, one or more regular symbols can be transformed into Wild. The Wild symbol is paying and worth as much as the princess. It also replaces all symbols except the specials. The Scatter symbol, besides being paying, rewards with a number of free spins ranging from 10 to 50. \n\nIf a duel starts during the bonus game, each prince's victory adds a gem to the ranking. If you win 6, the free games end, and a prize of 1,000,000 coins is awarded.\n\nDuring free spins, two vials may appear, one blue and one pink, which can award 1 to 5 extra spins. The game is engaging, and with its numerous bonuses, it ensures that players are kept entertained for hours.\n        ",

The symbols and background are excellently designed, and the soundtrack is typical of oriental culture.\n\nGame Features\n\nThe game features 5 reels and 4 rows, with players winning by creating winning combinations both horizontally and vertically. There are 15 fixed lines, with each token costing between €0.01 and €20.00. The game has a jackpot which can be randomly awarded, with an RTP of 96.72%.\n\nSymbol Payouts\n\nThere are 7 regular symbols in Before Time Runs Out, with the lower ones represented by copper, silver, and gold coins, and the higher ones featuring the scimitar, vizier, prince, and princess. The symbols of the prince and vizier give rise to duels, which can transform some regular symbols into Wild. The Wild symbol is paying and worth as much as the princess, and the Scatter symbol rewards players with free spins.\n\nBonus Games\n\nBefore Time Runs Out offers players a range of bonus games. The duels between the prince and the vizier can transform regular symbols into Wild, and the Scatter symbol grants free spins. If a duel starts during the bonus game, each prince's victory adds a gem to the ranking, with a prize of 1,000,000 coins for players who win 6 gems.\n\nFree Spins\n\nDuring free spins, two vials may appear, one blue and one pink, which can award 1 to 5 extra spins. The game rewards players with free spins ranging from 10 to 50, depending on the number of Scatter symbols landed on the reels.\n\n        \n            ",

The background is represented by a princely room that opens onto a starry sky and palaces with typical oriental shapes; the work on the symbols is also excellent, as they seem to come out of a Disney artist's pencil and are perfect. The foreground grid has a frame rich in swirls and on the side is an hourglass.\n\nOn the lower part of the console, we have all the buttons and info that allow us to set the bet to our liking. The soundtrack deserves a special mention, with a melody typical of oriental culture.\n\nFeatures of Before Time Runs Out\n\nThe slot has 5 reels and 4 rows, and unlike many other slots, you win by creating winning combinations both horizontally and vertically. There are 15 fixed lines, and each token has a cost ranging from €0.01 to €20.00. \n\nWith every spin, a part of the bet is moved into the jackpot, which can be randomly awarded. The RTP is 96.72%.\n\nSymbols and features\n\nMore than the base game, what struck us about Before Time Runs Out was the high number of bonuses available.\n\nThe regular symbols are 7, the lower ones are copper, silver, and gold coins, while the higher ones are the scimitar, the vizier, the prince, and the princess.\n\nThe symbol of the prince and that of the vizier can give rise to duels: depending on the winner, one or more regular symbols can be transformed into Wild.\n\nThe Wild symbol is paying and worth as much as the princess, it also replaces all symbols except the specials. The Scatter symbol, besides being paying, rewards with a number of free spins ranging from 10 to 50. \n\nIf a duel starts during the bonus game, each prince's victory adds a gem to the ranking. If you win 6, the free games end, and a prize of 1,000,000 coins is awarded.\n\nDuring free spins, two vials may appear, one blue and one pink, which can award 1 to 5 extra spins.\n        ",
