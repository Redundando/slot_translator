For the few who are unaware, the story tells of an adventurous archaeologist who embarks on adrenaline-fueled escapades to solve some of the greatest mysteries in history. Now imagine this character and his entire narrative world in canine form, and you'll have Indiana Bones!\n\nAs one might expect, the main character is a dog. Both the sidekick and the antagonist also belong to the same species, with the latter being a chihuahua dressed in elegant attire and possessing a truly sinister smirk!\n\nThe setting is the Amazon forest, with the game grid located at the entrance of a temple adorned with columns bearing the effigies of three dogs. Needless to say, the symbols are beautifully drawn in cartoon style, with fun animations that make the game more dynamic. The sound effects are also impressive, featuring adventurous music befitting the best action movies.\n\nFeatures of Indiana Bones\n\nNow let's see how to place bets. Firstly, to win, you must create a series of identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel and moving to the right. The game grid has 5 reels and 3 rows with 20 paylines. Each spin costs at least €0.20, up to a maximum of €40.\n\nThere are two ways to speed up the game: the first is the Turbo function, which makes the symbols fall faster, the second is the Autoplay function, which allows you to set a variable number of automatic spins. Indiana Bones has medium volatility and an RTP of 96%.\n\nHow to win at Indiana Bones\n\nThere are 9 regular symbols available for combos, including playing cards from 9 to Ace, which have low values. There are also three gemstones, which turn into Wild symbols under certain conditions that we'll discuss shortly. The antagonist, sidekick, and Indiana are the regular symbols that pay out the most, but to understand the exact amounts of winnings, we suggest opening the paytable from the menu.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the gemstones can be transformed into Wilds. This happens when one of the three masks of different colors (green, orange, or purple) appears on the fifth reel. Depending on the color of the mask, all the gemstones become Jokers for the next three spins. The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, which activates the Free Spins. On the second free spin, all purple gemstones turn into Wilds, orange gems on the third spin, and green gems on the fifth spin.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nCan I play Indiana Bones on my smartphone?\n\nCertainly, this slot uses HTML5 architecture, making it available on any desktop or mobile device.\n\nWhat is the maximum payout of Indiana Bones?\n\nYou can win up to 1,000 times your bet.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nIndiana Bones has an RTP of 96%.",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics and rules\n\nIndiana Bones features a 5-reel, 3-row set-up and 20 paylines. Players must create a series of identical symbols starting from the left reel and moving to the right in order to win. The game has medium volatility and an RTP of 96%. It offers both turbo and autoplay functions to speed up the game and create a more customized experience. Betting starts at €0.20, with a maximum bet of €40 per spin.\n\nSymbols and their value\n\nIndiana Bones features a range of symbols, including playing cards from 9 to ace with low values, three precious stones with higher values, and regular symbols like Indiana, the antagonist, and the helper. The three precious stones can also become Wilds when one of the three masks appears on the fifth reel, turning all precious stones into Wilds for three rounds. The Wilds can substitute all symbols except the Scatter symbol.\n\nBonus features (wilds, scatters, free spins)\n\nIndiana Bones features several bonus features, including Wilds that can replace other symbols to create a winning combination, a Scatter symbol that can activate Free Spins, and an automatic transformation of precious stones into Wilds when certain masks appear on the fifth reel. The first two Free Spins continue as normal, but by the third, all purple stones are transformed into Wilds. The same transformation happens with orange stones on the sixth free spin and green stones on the ninth free spin.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nAs previously mentioned, Indiana Bones has medium volatility and an RTP of 96%. Higher volatility games tend to have larger payouts, but payouts happen less frequently. With a medium volatility, players can expect to win more often, but the payouts will be smaller in comparison to a game with higher volatility. The RTP, or Return To Player, of 96% means that on average, players can expect to receive 96% of their bets back as winnings over a long period of time. \n\nVisual and audio design\n\nIndiana Bones features a cartoon-style design with well-crafted symbols and amusing animations to create a dynamic, engaging gameplay experience. The game is set in the Amazon rainforest, with the grid located at the entrance of an ancient temple whose columns are adorned with the effigies of three dogs. The sound department matches the adventurous theme, with music that evokes the adventurous spirit of the game.\n\n        \n            ",

To start the game, players need at least €0.20 and a maximum of €40. The game's medium volatility and RTP of 96% make it an excellent choice for low and mid-range gamblers. The game also has two features to speed up gameplay: the Turbo function makes the fall of the symbols quick, and Autoplay function allows players can set a specific number of automatic spins.\n\nDesign and animation\n\nIndiana Bones's setting is in the Amazon rainforest, with a game grid located at the entrance of an ancient temple. The temple's columns bear effigies of three dogs, while the symbols are cartoonish and well-designed. The sound department also plays its part, with an adventurous music worthy of the best action movies.\n\nSymbols and payouts\n\nThere are nine regular symbols that players can use for combos, with playing cards from 9 to ace that have a low value. The three precious stones can also transform into Wilds under specific conditions. The antagonist, the helper, and Indiana are the regular symbols that pay better than anyone else. Players can check the paytable in the menu to get a clear idea of how much each win is worth.\n\nSpecial features and bonuses\n\nIndiana Bones has special features like the precious stones that can transform into Wilds under certain conditions. When one of the three masks of different colors (green, orange, or purple) appears on the fifth reel, all precious stones correspond to the same color and become Wilds for the following three spins. The Wild replaces all symbols except the Scatter, which is used to activate the Free Spins. On the second free spin, all purple stones turn into Wilds, after three spins, the orange ones follow, and after five Free Spins, the green ones turn into Wilds. \n\nWinning potential and RTP\n\nThe maximum win players can get from Indiana Bones is up to 1,000 times your bet. With a medium volatility and an RTP of 96%, it's a great option for anyone who is looking for enjoyable play without risking too much, whether low or mid-range gamblers.\n\n        \n            ",

For the very few who do not know, the story tells of an adventurous archaeologist who lives adrenaline-fueled adventures in the attempt to solve some of the greatest mysteries of history. Now imagine this character and his entire narrative world declined in the canine version, and you will have Indiana Bones!\n\nAs you can imagine, the main character is a dog, but the helper and antagonist, a chihuahua dressed in an elegant dress with a truly sinister grin, also belong to the same species!\n\nThe setting is the Amazon rainforest, with the game grid located at the entrance of what looks like an ancient temple, whose columns bear the effigies of three dogs.\n\nNeedless to say, the symbols are very well designed, in a cartoon style, with funny animations that make the game more dynamic. The sound department also plays its part, thanks to an adventurous music worthy of the best action movies.\n\nFeatures of Indiana Bones\nLet's see now how to prepare the bets. Let's start by saying that to win you need to create a series of identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding towards the right. The game grid has 5 reels and 3 rows and 20 paylines. Each spin costs at least €0.20, the maximum is €40.\n\nThere are two ways to speed up the game: the first is the Turbo function that makes the fall of the symbols immediate, the second is to use the Autoplay function that allows you to set a variable number of automatic spins. Indiana Bones has medium volatility and an RTP of 96%.\n\nHow to win at Indiana Bones\nThere are 9 regular symbols available for combos, with playing cards from 9 to ace that have a low value. Then there are the three precious stones, which also transform into Wilds under certain conditions that we will see shortly. The antagonist, the helper, and Indiana are the regular symbols that pay better than anyone else, but to have a clear idea of how much the winnings amount, we suggest opening the paytable from the menu.\n\nAs mentioned above, precious stones can be transformed into Wilds. This happens when one of the three masks of three different colors (green, orange, or purple) appears on the fifth reel. Depending on the color, all precious stones are transformed into Wilds even for the following three spins. The function of the Wild is to replace all symbols except the Scatter, which is used to activate the Free Spins. On the second free spin, all purple stones are transformed into Wilds, after 3 spins it will be the turn of the orange ones, and after 5 Free Spins, it will be the turn of the green ones.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I play Indiana Bones on my smartphone too?\n\nCertainly, this slot uses an HTML5 architecture that makes it usable from any fixed and mobile device.\n\nWhat is the maximum win for Indiana Bones?\n\nYou can win up to 1,000 times your bet.\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\n\nIndiana Bones has an RTP of 96%.\n        ",
