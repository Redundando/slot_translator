As experienced gamblers, we know this software company takes great care in its graphics, and we were not disappointed.\n\nThe symbols are highly defined, and the colors are bright, yet easy on the eyes even after extended playtime. Gameplay is also smooth with no crashes or lags. The golden-framed game grid showcases a full-body Joker holding a pot of gold coins. The Joker isn't just a visual element but has a real function in the game, which we will dive into soon.\n\nOn the lower part of the screen, we find buttons to access the menu and paytable, information on our wager, and buttons for 'Start' and 'Autoplay.' The sound department comprises cabaret music that can be turned off in the settings.\n\nFeatures of the Slot\n\nThe 4-row, 6-reel grid features 25 paylines. We can adjust our bets with the '+/-' symbols next to the 'Start' button to choose the bet and coin values. The minimum stake is 0.01 EUR per line, making a full spin cost only 0.25 EUR. The maximum bet value with the highest coin value is 125 EUR, but intermediaries levels are available for a more personalized bet.\n\nWe can also activate 10 to 1,000 automatic spins with two functions: Quick Spin and Turbo Spin. The game's RTP value is 96.5%, and the volatility is high, meaning we may win less frequently, but the amounts will be significant.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nWe win by landing identical and adjacent symbols from left to right. The lowest-paying symbols are oranges, plums, and cherries, followed by the Bar, seven, and star symbols. The Joker represents the Wild symbol, replacing all but the Scatter. The Wild is also a paying symbol with the same value as the star symbol, the highest paying symbol.\n\nEach time a Wild symbol appears on the reels, the Joker next to the frame transforms a random symbol into a Wild one, significantly increasing our winnings.\n\nThe crown symbol is the Scatter and can land on all reels with a 2x, 3x, 5x, 10x, or 25x multiplier. If we land more than one Scatter, the multipliers will be added. Depending on the number of Scatters, we get a certain number of free spins:\n\n- 3 Scatters offer 8 free spins\n- 4 Scatters offer 10 free spins\n- 5 Scatters offer 15 free spins\n- 6 Scatters offer 20 free spins\n\nDuring Free Spins, both the Wild substitution feature and Scatter symbols remain active, according to the above-mentioned rules.

As seasoned players, we knew that this software house always pays great attention to the graphics, and we were not disappointed. The symbols are well-defined, the colours are bright and don't tire the eyes even after playing for a long time. The game is smooth and glitch-free.\n\nThe game grid is framed in gold, with a full-size Joker holding a pile of gold coins in his hand. This is not just a visual gimmick; it has a major role in the game, as we will see later on. The bottom of the screen shows the buttons to access the menu and the paytable, information regarding our bets, and the Start and Autoplay buttons. The sound consists of typical cabaret music, which can be turned off in the settings.\n\nGame Features\n\nThe grid has 4 rows and 6 reels with 25 paylines. The bets can be calibrated according to our preferences, using the \"+\" and \"-\" buttons alongside the Start button. We can choose both the bet value and the coin value. The minimum value is €0.01 per line, so a full spin will cost only €0.25. By increasing the bet and coin values to the maximum, we can reach €125, but there are many intermediate levels that allow us to customize our bets to our liking. We can activate automatic spins from 10 up to 1,000, and two features: Fast Reels and Turbo Reels.\n\nThe RTP value is 96.5%, while the volatility is high, meaning that we will win less frequently, but each time it happens, the amounts will be significant.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\n\nWe win with identical and adjacent symbols from left to right. Oranges, plums, and cherries are worth less, followed by the Bar, the number seven, and the star. The Joker is our Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter. The Wild is also a paying symbol, and its value is the same as that of the star, which is the highest of all. Whenever a Wild symbol appears on the reels, the Joker by the frame transforms a random symbol into a Wild, significantly increasing our wins.\n\nThe crown is our Scatter symbol. It can appear on all reels and is associated with a multiplier of 2x, 3x, 5x, 10x, or 25x. If there are multiple Scatters, the multipliers are added up. Depending on the number of Scatters, we will be rewarded with several free spins:\n\n-3 Scatter symbols offer 8 free spins\n-4 Scatter symbols offer 10 free spins\n-5 Scatter symbols offer 15 free spins\n-6 Scatter symbols offer 20 free spins\n\nDuring the Free Spins, both the Wild Substitution feature and the Scatters are active, so the function can be increased according to the rules described above. With this special feature, the maximum win is 5,000x the bet.\n            ",

The game is smooth and glitch-free, and can be played using the Start and Autoplay buttons. Players can activate automatic spins, as well as two features: Fast Reels and Turbo Reels.\n\nGame graphics and design\n\nThe game is framed in gold, with a full-size Joker holding a pile of gold coins. The symbols are well-defined and have bright colours that don't tire the eyes. The sound comprises typical cabaret music which can be turned off in the settings.\n\nCustomizable bets\n\nPlayers can calibrate their bets according to their preferences. Bet values and coin values can be chosen using the '+' and '-' buttons alongside the Start button. The minimum value is €0.01 per line, while the maximum can reach €125. There are many intermediate levels that allow players to customize their bets to their liking. \n\nGame symbols and functionality\n\nJoker King is a fruit-themed slot game with a Joker icon that embodies gambling. Winning combinations are formed with identical and adjacent symbols from left to right, with varying payouts. The Joker is the Wild symbol and can replace all symbols, except the Scatter. Whenever a Wild symbol appears on the reels, the Joker by the frame transforms a random symbol into a Wild, significantly increasing the player's wins. The crown is the Scatter symbol and appears on all reels, associated with a multiplier of 2x, 3x, 5x, 10x or 25x. Depending on the number of Scatters, players will be rewarded with free spins. During the free spins, both the Wild Substitution feature and the Scatters are active, increasing the player's chances of winning. With this special feature, the maximum win is 5,000x the bet.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nJoker King has an RTP value of 96.5% and high volatility. Players can expect to win less frequently, but when a win does occur, the amounts will be significant.\n\n        \n            ",

(4 bullet points)\n- Bullet lists briefly covering the topic \"What we don't like\". (2 bullet pints)\n- SEO optimized meta title with a maximum length of 45 characters. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics\n\nJoker King has a 4x6 reel grid with 25 paylines. Players can choose their bet value and coin value using the “+” and “-” buttons. Minimum bet is €0.01 per line, and maximum is €125. There are intermediate levels that allow players to customize their bets to their liking. The game has automatic spins from 10 up to 1,000, as well as Fast Reels and Turbo Reels. The game has an RTP value of 96.5% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and Symbol Functionality\n\nSymbols include oranges, plums, cherries, the Bar, the number seven, crown, star, and the Joker. Wins are achieved with adjacent identical symbols from left to right. The Joker is the Wild and replaces all symbols except the Scatter. Whenever a Wild appears on the reels, a random symbol is transformed into a Wild, increasing wins. The Wild is also a paying symbol with the same value as the star. Crown is the Scatter and appears on all reels; it is associated with a multiplier of 2x, 3x, 5x, 10x, or 25x. The game's maximum win is 5,000x the bet.\n\nBonuses and Features\n\nThe maximum number of free spins that players can win in Joker King is 20. Triggering free spins requires landing a certain number of Scatters symbols on the reels. Depending on the number of Scatters landed, players can win 8 to 20 free spins. During free spins, both the Wild Substitution feature and the Scatters are active, meaning that the special feature can be increased. With this special feature, Joker King's maximum win is 5,000x the bet.\n\nVisuals and Graphics\n\nJoker King has a fruit theme combined with the iconic symbol of the Joker. The symbols are well-defined, and the colours are bright, even after playing for a long time. The game is smooth and glitch-free, and the visual gimmick of a full-size Joker holding a pile of gold coins in his hand is a major part of the game's look. The game grid is framed in gold. The layout of the screen includes buttons to access the menu and the paytable, information regarding our bets, and the Start and Autoplay buttons. The sound consists of typical cabaret music, which can be turned off in the settings.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nJoker King has an RTP value of 96.5%, which is higher than the industry standard. The game has high volatility, meaning that players will win less frequently, but each time they do, the amounts will be significant.\n\n        \n            ",

As seasoned players, we knew that this software house always pays great attention to the graphics, and we were not disappointed. The symbols are well-defined, the colours are bright and don't tire the eyes even after playing for a long time. The game is smooth and glitch-free.\n\nThe game grid is framed in gold, with a full-size Joker holding a pile of gold coins in his hand. This is not just a visual gimmick; it has a major role in the game, as we will see later on. The bottom of the screen shows the buttons to access the menu and the paytable, information regarding our bets, and the Start and Autoplay buttons. The sound consists of typical cabaret music, which can be turned off in the settings.\n\nGame Features\n\nThe grid has 4 rows and 6 reels with 25 paylines. The bets can be calibrated according to our preferences, using the \"+\" and \"-\" buttons alongside the Start button. We can choose both the bet value and the coin value. The minimum value is €0.01 per line, so a full spin will cost only €0.25. By increasing the bet and coin values to the maximum, we can reach €125, but there are many intermediate levels that allow us to customize our bets to our liking. We can activate automatic spins from 10 up to 1,000, and two features: Fast Reels and Turbo Reels.\n\nThe RTP value is 96.5%, while the volatility is high, meaning that we will win less frequently, but each time it happens, the amounts will be significant.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\n\nWe win with identical and adjacent symbols from left to right. Oranges, plums, and cherries are worth less, followed by the Bar, the number seven, and the star. The Joker is our Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except the Scatter. The Wild is also a paying symbol, and its value is the same as that of the star, which is the highest of all. Whenever a Wild symbol appears on the reels, the Joker by the frame transforms a random symbol into a Wild, significantly increasing our wins.\n\nThe crown is our Scatter symbol. It can appear on all reels and is associated with a multiplier of 2x, 3x, 5x, 10x, or 25x. If there are multiple Scatters, the multipliers are added up. Depending on the number of Scatters, we will be rewarded with several free spins:\n\n-3 Scatter symbols offer 8 free spins\n-4 Scatter symbols offer 10 free spins\n-5 Scatter symbols offer 15 free spins\n-6 Scatter symbols offer 20 free spins\n\nDuring the Free Spins, both the Wild Substitution feature and the Scatters are active, so the function can be increased according to the rules described above. With this special feature, the maximum win is 5,000x the bet.\n        ",
