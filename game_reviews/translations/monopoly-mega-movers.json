We all know how important perseverance is in gambling. It takes many spins to figure out the tricks of a particular slot machine, which is why it's essential to enjoy every bet.\n\nWe mentioned how themes range from movies to TV series, but you might not know they also include board games. We all grew up spending time with family or friends playing Monopoly, which is why WMS has created a slot machine inspired by this fantastic game. Read on to learn more!\n\nLet's talk about its graphics\nThere isn't much to say about Monopoly Mega Movers' graphics. The slot machine produced by WMS tries to faithfully reproduce the historic board game created by Charles Darrow. If you also spent your childhood playing Monopoly, this slot machine will capture your attention from the first spin.\n\nIn addition to the classic board where you move through various streets and squares, you'll notice three constantly spinning wheels at the top. If you want to know how these wheels will help you win lots of money, you need to keep reading the section about the functions.\n\nFor now, let's talk about the symbols you can find. There are certainly the most classic ones, such as the hat, the dog, the car, and the train. Others, more modern ones, like the cat, have been added.\n\nBefore you start playing, read on to learn about the numerous functions of this slot machine.\n\nThe functions of the slot machine\nThe first function that's definitely interesting is the one we mentioned before, related to the three wheels that can be found above the slot reels. Each one has its own name: one says \"three in a row\", then \"four in a row,\" and finally, \"five in a row.\" If you have a basic knowledge of the English language, you know that it’s about symbols that come in a series: three symbols in a row, four, and five symbols in a row.\n\nWhen you get lucky and get a combination like this, the respective wheel starts spinning, allowing you to win a special prize. In particular, you can get: an upgrade, meaning a free spin of the reel directly following the one where the combination occurred; free spins, giving you the chance to activate all the slot machine reels for free; a jackpot, meaning a cash prize, ranging from modest to those that will make you rich for life.\n\nAs you can see, the bonuses you can get are really numerous. That's why the paylines are only 30, offset by a slightly higher payout than 96%. Definitely an excellent percentage.\n\nSimilar slot machines\nIf you liked Monopoly Mega Movers for its revisitation of the famous board game that made us passionate during moments with family and friends, you should know that there's another famous slot with this theme. It's Monopoly Once Around Deluxe, another slot machine produced by WMS. In this case, you can even build houses and hotels at a precise moment in the game!\n            ",

We all know how important perseverance is in gambling. It takes many spins to figure out the tricks of a particular slot machine, which is why it's essential to enjoy every bet.\n\nWe mentioned how themes range from movies to TV series, but you might not know they also include board games. We all grew up spending time with family or friends playing Monopoly, which is why WMS has created a slot machine inspired by this fantastic game. Read on to learn more!\n\nLet's talk about its graphics\nThere isn't much to say about Monopoly Mega Movers' graphics. The slot machine produced by WMS tries to faithfully reproduce the historic board game created by Charles Darrow. If you also spent your childhood playing Monopoly, this slot machine will capture your attention from the first spin.\n\nIn addition to the classic board where you move through various streets and squares, you'll notice three constantly spinning wheels at the top. If you want to know how these wheels will help you win lots of money, you need to keep reading the section about the functions.\n\nFor now, let's talk about the symbols you can find.

Others, more modern ones, like the cat, have been added.\n\nBefore you start playing, read on to learn about the numerous functions of this slot machine.\n\nThe functions of the slot machine\nThe first function that's definitely interesting is the one we mentioned before, related to the three wheels that can be found above the slot reels. Each one has its own name: one says \"three in a row\", then \"four in a row,\" and finally, \"five in a row.\" If you have a basic knowledge of the English language, you know that it’s about symbols that come in a series: three symbols in a row, four, and five symbols in a row.\n\nWhen you get lucky and get a combination like this, the respective wheel starts spinning, allowing you to win a special prize. In particular, you can get: an upgrade, meaning a free spin of the reel directly following the one where the combination occurred; free spins, giving you the chance to activate all the slot machine reels for free; a jackpot, meaning a cash prize, ranging from modest to those that will make you rich for life.\n\nAs you can see, the bonuses you can get are really numerous. That's why the paylines are only 30, offset by a slightly higher payout than 96%. Definitely an excellent percentage.\n\nSimilar slot machines\nIf you liked Monopoly Mega Movers for its revisitation of the famous board game that made us passionate during moments with family and friends, you should know that there's another famous slot with this theme. It's Monopoly Once Around Deluxe, another slot machine produced by WMS. In this case, you can even build houses and hotels at a precise moment in the game!\n            ",
