We're talking about dragons: protagonists of many beautiful legends, it is said that dragons were the guardians of caves full of gold and precious stones, and that they defended these treasures by spitting fire and flames on intrepid adventurers who sought to conquer riches.\nThe theme itself is not particularly original, as there are several slot games that have featured it, but we believe that Dragon's Inferno is a very enjoyable slot to play and that, from a graphic point of view, it is structured in such a way as to make the gaming experience quite fun and engaging.\nThe initial screen opens with a sort of sea of lava with the figure of a dragon looming over it, and the same bright orange tones form the background for the reels in the game screen. The symbols are reproduced with enough accuracy and overall, the graphics of Dragon's Inferno closely resemble the famous Eragon saga.\n\nMain features of the slot\nDragon's Inferno is a slot machine that will certainly appeal to Dungeons and Dragons role-playing game enthusiasts, thanks to its well-organized gameplay and excellent winning opportunities! Let's start with the structure, which is very simple and traditional: it has five reels and three rows, and bets can be placed on 30 paylines. The paylines are fixed, so you will have to play on all 30 lines together. The coin on Dragon's Inferno has a value ranging from €0.01 to €3, and bets range from a minimum of €0.30 to a maximum of €90.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of this WMS slot machine is not particularly convincing at 95.97%, but it is in line with other games from this provider.\nDragon's Inferno can be played on both desktop computers and mobile devices, whether they are Android, iOS or Windows, and you can practice without investing real money or downloading anything thanks to the Play for Fun mode, available in most online casinos.\n\nSymbols and special features of Dragon's Inferno\nThe symbols of Dragon's Inferno are almost entirely thematic, except for the four suits of playing cards (hearts, flowers, spades, and diamonds). The reels alternate with brave knights, archers, elves (or rather, \"elfs\"), but also treasure chests, spell books, crystal spheres, and potions.\nThe treasure chest is the game's Wild symbol and replaces all other symbols except the Scatter, which is represented by the dragon.\nThe Scatter gives a really substantial number of free spins, according to the following scheme: 3 Scatters activate 10 Free Spins, 4 Scatter symbols activate 20 Free Spins, while 5 Scatters activate 40 Free Spins. All winnings during free spins are subject to a 2X multiplier.\nIt is worth mentioning the \"Replicating Wild\" feature: when the treasure chest creates a winning combination, the dragon emits a huge fireball that lands on the reels and turns the symbol it reaches into a Wild.\n            ",

We're talking about dragons: protagonists of many beautiful legends, it is said that dragons were the guardians of caves full of gold and precious stones, and that they defended these treasures by spitting fire and flames on intrepid adventurers who sought to conquer riches.\nThe theme itself is not particularly original, as there are several slot games that have featured it, but we believe that Dragon's Inferno is a very enjoyable slot to play and that, from a graphic point of view, it is structured in such a way as to make the gaming experience quite fun and engaging.\nThe initial screen opens with a sort of sea of lava with the figure of a dragon looming over it, and the same bright orange tones form the background for the reels in the game screen. The symbols are reproduced with enough accuracy and overall, the graphics of Dragon's Inferno closely resemble the famous Eragon saga.\n\nMain features of the slot\nDragon's Inferno is a slot machine that will certainly appeal to Dungeons and Dragons role-playing game enthusiasts, thanks to its well-organized gameplay and excellent winning opportunities! Let's start with the structure, which is very simple and traditional: it has five reels and three rows, and bets can be placed on 30 paylines. The paylines are fixed, so you will have to play on all 30 lines together. The coin on Dragon's Inferno has a value ranging from €0.01 to €3, and bets range from a minimum of €0.30 to a maximum of €90.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of this WMS slot machine is not particularly convincing at 95.97%, but it is in line with other games from this provider.\nDragon's Inferno can be played on both desktop computers and mobile devices, whether they are Android, iOS or Windows, and you can practice without investing real money or downloading anything thanks to the Play for Fun mode, available in most online casinos.\n\nSymbols and special features of Dragon's Inferno\nThe symbols of Dragon's Inferno are almost entirely thematic, except for the four suits of playing cards (hearts, flowers, spades, and diamonds). The reels alternate with brave knights, archers, elves (or rather, \"elfs\"), but also treasure chests, spell books, crystal spheres, and potions.\nThe treasure chest is the game's Wild symbol and replaces all other symbols except the Scatter, which is represented by the dragon.\nThe Scatter gives a really substantial number of free spins, according to the following scheme: 3 Scatters activate 10 Free Spins, 4 Scatter symbols activate 20 Free Spins, while 5 Scatters activate 40 Free Spins. All winnings during free spins are subject to a 2X multiplier.\nIt is worth mentioning the \"Replicating Wild\" feature: when the treasure chest creates a winning combination, the dragon emits a huge fireball that lands on the reels and turns the symbol it reaches into a Wild.\n            ",

We're talking about dragons: protagonists of many beautiful legends, it is said that dragons were the guardians of caves full of gold and precious stones, and that they defended these treasures by spitting fire and flames on intrepid adventurers who sought to conquer riches.\nThe theme itself is not particularly original, as there are several slot games that have featured it, but we believe that Dragon's Inferno is a very enjoyable slot to play and that, from a graphic point of view, it is structured in such a way as to make the gaming experience quite fun and engaging.\nThe initial screen opens with a sort of sea of lava with the figure of a dragon looming over it, and the same bright orange tones form the background for the reels in the game screen. The symbols are reproduced with enough accuracy and overall, the graphics of Dragon's Inferno closely resemble the famous Eragon saga.\n\nMain features of the slot\nDragon's Inferno is a slot machine that will certainly appeal to Dungeons and Dragons role-playing game enthusiasts, thanks to its well-organized gameplay and excellent winning opportunities! Let's start with the structure, which is very simple and traditional: it has five reels and three rows, and bets can be placed on 30 paylines. The paylines are fixed, so you will have to play on all 30 lines together. The coin on Dragon's Inferno has a value ranging from €0.01 to €3, and bets range from a minimum of €0.30 to a maximum of €90.\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of this WMS slot machine is not particularly convincing at 95.97%, but it is in line with other games from this provider.\nDragon's Inferno can be played on both desktop computers and mobile devices, whether they are Android, iOS or Windows, and you can practice without investing real money or downloading anything thanks to the Play for Fun mode, available in most online casinos.\n\nSymbols and special features of Dragon's Inferno\nThe symbols of Dragon's Inferno are almost entirely thematic, except for the four suits of playing cards (hearts, flowers, spades, and diamonds). The reels alternate with brave knights, archers, elves (or rather, \"elfs\"), but also treasure chests, spell books, crystal spheres, and potions.\nThe treasure chest is the game's Wild symbol and replaces all other symbols except the Scatter, which is represented by the dragon.\nThe Scatter gives a really substantial number of free spins, according to the following scheme: 3 Scatters activate 10 Free Spins, 4 Scatter symbols activate 20 Free Spins, while 5 Scatters activate 40 Free Spins. All winnings during free spins are subject to a 2X multiplier.\nIt is worth mentioning the \"Replicating Wild\" feature: when the treasure chest creates a winning combination, the dragon emits a huge fireball that lands on the reels and turns the symbol it reaches into a Wild.\n            ",
