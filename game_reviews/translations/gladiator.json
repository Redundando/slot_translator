It has a minimum bet of €0.01 and a maximum bet of €1250, with the potential to win a jackpot of €2.5 million. The game has an RTP of 94.09% and an Autoplay feature.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nGladiator's gameplay is straightforward, with all the standard features of a video slot game. The Autoplay function allows players to set the number of spins and sit back and watch the game unfold. The game also offers two Bonus Games and a Gamble function. The Gladiator Bonus Game, activated by three Wild symbols, provides the player with nine helmets, with free spins or multipliers hidden behind them. The Coliseum Bonus Game, triggered by three Scatter symbols, offers a grid of 25 stones, with a series of free spins, multipliers, and symbol and wild card selection hidden behind them.\n\nSymbols and Graphics\n\nGladiator's symbols are faithful to the characters and imagery of the Ridley Scott film. The protagonists, Maximus Decimus Meridius, Lucilla, Senator Gracchus, and Emperor Marcus Aurelius, are all represented, as is the Colosseum. The game's graphics are outstanding, with detailed, high definition symbols, immersive sound effects, and 3D animations that capture the epic scale and drama of the film. The result is a visually stunning slot game that will appeal to fans of ancient Rome, film, and technical proficiency in online gaming.\n\nBonus Games and Gamble Function\n\nGladiator offers two Bonus Games: the Gladiator Bonus Game, triggered by three Wild symbols, allows players to choose from nine helmets containing free spins or multipliers. The Coliseum Bonus Game, triggered by three Scatter symbols, offers a grid of 25 stones, with a series of free spins, multipliers, and symbol and wild card selection hidden behind them. The Gamble function offers players the opportunity to double their winnings, activated after any winning amount.\n\nReturn To Player (RTP)\n\nGladiator's RTP is 94.09%, which is lower than some other video slot games. However, with a large maximum bet and a potential jackpot of €2.5 million, the game offers significant rewards for those who are willing to take the risk. Players should be aware that the RNG (Random Number Generator) ensures fair play, but results are not guaranteed and should be approached with caution.\n\n        \n            ",

The game features a Wild symbol, represented by the Gladiator's helmet, which can replace all other symbols except for the Scatter. Three Wild symbols in a row activate the Gladiator Bonus Game feature, where players can win free spins or multipliers. The Colosseum symbol serves as the Scatter and can earn players 100 coins. Three Scatters activate the Coliseum Bonus Game feature, where players can win free spins, multipliers, and determine the Wild and Scatter symbols.\n\nVisuals and design of the online slot game\n\nGladiator features brilliant graphics and 3D animations that are faithful to the protagonists of the film. The immersive sound effects create a unique and engaging gaming atmosphere. The symbols are in high definition and the technology used in the game is impressive.\n\nCharacters and symbols featured in the game\n\nThe regular symbols in Gladiator are represented by characters from the film, including Maximus Decimus Meridius, Lucilla, Senator Gracchus, and Emperor Marcus Aurelius. The Colosseum is also a symbol, along with traditional poker cards from 9 to Ace. The Wild symbol is represented by the Gladiator's helmet and the Scatter symbol is the Colosseum.\n\nBonus games available in Gladiator\n\nGladiator offers two bonus games: the Gladiator Bonus Game and the Coliseum Bonus Game. The Gladiator Bonus Game is activated when players get three Wild symbols in a row and allows them to win free spins or multipliers.

The theme is undoubtedly fascinating, but it's the graphics from the Playtech team that leave you in awe! The technology is the real hallmark of this game: the spectacular 3D animations accompanied by immersive sound effects will make you relive the emotions of the film and create a unique and engaging gaming atmosphere! The symbols, in addition to being in high definition, are faithful to the protagonists of the film, making the game even more realistic! Overall, if you are a lover of events related to ancient Rome, or if your passion is film, if you are simply looking for hyper-technical games and you are not satisfied with a banal fruit machine, then Gladiator is just what you're looking for!\n\nRegular Symbols:\nAs you would expect, the regular symbols are represented by the protagonists of the film, first and foremost the Gladiator himself, Maximus Decimus Meridius, as well as Lucilla, Senator Gracchus, and Emperor Marcus Aurelius. The Colosseum, a true symbol of Rome, couldn't be missing. In addition to them, as is often the case, traditional poker cards from 9 to Ace are also present.\n\nSpecial Symbols and Bonus Games:\nThe Wild symbol, represented by the Gladiator's helmet, has the function of a wild card which, except for the Scatter, allows it to replace all other symbols and thus complete a winning combination. However, in this slot, the Wild is not the only role played by the symbol: in fact, if it appears on the reels three times in a row, the \"Gladiator Bonus Game\" special feature is activated. With the Bonus Game, we have a new screen with 9 helmets. By clicking on them, the player will discover what is hidden behind them: they could be free spins or multipliers! The Colosseum is instead the Scatter symbol. It too has a dual function within the game: first, when it appears on the reels, it allows you to earn 100 coins, but if it comes out three times, it will activate the slot's second bonus game, called the \"Coliseum Bonus Game\". The Bonus Game consists of a kind of grid consisting of 25 boulders: under each of them are the prizes, which must be revealed in order starting from the first line at the bottom. The first line relates to the number of free spins won, the second to the multiplier for winnings during free spins, the third to the symbol that will represent the Scatter and finally, the fourth will tell us which symbol will instead occupy the wild card function. In addition to the two Bonus games, there is also the Gamble function which is activated after any winning amount, offering the opportunity to double it.\n            ",

The theme is undoubtedly fascinating, but it's the graphics from the Playtech team that leave you in awe! The technology is the real hallmark of this game: the spectacular 3D animations accompanied by immersive sound effects will make you relive the emotions of the film and create a unique and engaging gaming atmosphere! The symbols, in addition to being in high definition, are faithful to the protagonists of the film, making the game even more realistic! Overall, if you are a lover of events related to ancient Rome, or if your passion is film, if you are simply looking for hyper-technical games and you are not satisfied with a banal fruit machine, then Gladiator is just what you're looking for!\n\nRegular Symbols:\nAs you would expect, the regular symbols are represented by the protagonists of the film, first and foremost the Gladiator himself, Maximus Decimus Meridius, as well as Lucilla, Senator Gracchus, and Emperor Marcus Aurelius. The Colosseum, a true symbol of Rome, couldn't be missing. In addition to them, as is often the case, traditional poker cards from 9 to Ace are also present.\n\nSpecial Symbols and Bonus Games:\nThe Wild symbol, represented by the Gladiator's helmet, has the function of a wild card which, except for the Scatter, allows it to replace all other symbols and thus complete a winning combination. However, in this slot, the Wild is not the only role played by the symbol: in fact, if it appears on the reels three times in a row, the \"Gladiator Bonus Game\" special feature is activated. With the Bonus Game, we have a new screen with 9 helmets. By clicking on them, the player will discover what is hidden behind them: they could be free spins or multipliers! The Colosseum is instead the Scatter symbol. It too has a dual function within the game: first, when it appears on the reels, it allows you to earn 100 coins, but if it comes out three times, it will activate the slot's second bonus game, called the \"Coliseum Bonus Game\". The Bonus Game consists of a kind of grid consisting of 25 boulders: under each of them are the prizes, which must be revealed in order starting from the first line at the bottom. The first line relates to the number of free spins won, the second to the multiplier for winnings during free spins, the third to the symbol that will represent the Scatter and finally, the fourth will tell us which symbol will instead occupy the wild card function. In addition to the two Bonus games, there is also the Gamble function which is activated after any winning amount, offering the opportunity to double it.\n            ",
