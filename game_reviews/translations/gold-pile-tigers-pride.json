L’oro è e deve essere la tua missione: puoi provare a formare 5 combinazioni e cercare così di vincere premi Mini e Maxi, oppure tentare la fortuna per il Gran premio.

Per scendere di valore basterà puntare su carte che vanno dal K al 9, realizzate con un delizioso stile asiatico. Ruolo chiave nella struttura con le sue 25 linee di pagamento è il Gold Meter che aumenta il valore della scommessa. Ma attenzione: sarai anche nel deserto tra animali pericolosi, ma sono proprio le scommesse a giocare un ruolo chiave. In base infatti a quanto scommetti variano i premi Mini, Maxi e Grand. Potrebbe non essere una cosa immediata per i nuovi giocatori, ma non temere: bastano pochi giri di rodaggio per entrare nel vivo del gameplay, oppure ti basterà consultare la tabella dei pagamenti.\nFunzionalità speciali\nTorniamo a parlare del Gold Meter, citato poco fa, che è forse la miglior funzione extra che sia stata pensata dagli sviluppatori. Si posiziona sulla sinistra della griglia e può essere regolato con un valore compreso tra 10% e 100%. Nel momento in cui agisci sulla percentuale potrai vedere i lingotti d’oro impilarsi sopra il quinto rullo. E’ presto detto che maggiore è il tuo Gold Meter e più facile sarà l’arrivo di simboli sul rullo assegnato.\nAltrettanto interessanti e piacevoli sono i giri gratis: con tre Scatter puoi attivare questo bonus che inizia con 8, per arrivare poi a reintegrarli da 4 o 8 giri aggiuntivi se trovi altri Scatter sui rulli durante il round.\nConsiderazioni finali su Gold Pile Tigers Pride\nL’avventura c’è, è piacevole e ti offre 25 linee di pagamento sulle quali divertirti a sfidare la fortuna. La struttura come abbiamo detto è particolare e ben lontana dai canoni standard di gioco, ma è resa interessante per tale motivo. I colpi di scena non mancano e lo dimostra la tripla possibilità di jackpot a valore diverso che sono messi in palio.

Are you ready to search for rich treasures? Gold is your mission, and you can try to form 5 combinations to win Mini and Maxi prizes, or even try your luck for the Grand prize. However, to do so, you must take advantage of the extra features, Scatter, and free spins.\n\nThis video slot has 5 reels and is developed by Rarestone Gaming (Playtech), who have combined the worlds of animals and the desert perfectly. It may be unusual for some, especially for those who have been in the game for a while, but it's an interesting combo that could appeal to players.\n\nThe graphics of Gold Pile Tigers Pride are impressive, and the most valuable symbols include the main protagonist, the tiger, followed closely by their paw prints which represent the Wild. They can distribute prizes of up to 50,000 and 40,000 coins respectively. Additionally, there is an emerald ring, tiger tooth and statue, and a luxury vase. To decrease in value, simply bet on cards that range between K and 9, all made with a delightful Asian style.\n\nThe Gold Meter plays a key role in the game's 25 pay lines structure, increasing the value of your bet. However, be careful, as it is the bets that play a critical role in the game. The Mini, Maxi and Grand prizes vary depending on how much you wager. It may not be easy for new players, but don't worry – a few rounds are all it takes to get into the gameplay, or you can consult the payment table.\n\nLet's talk about the Gold Meter again – it's possibly the best extra feature that the developers have come up with. It is located on the left side of the grid, allowing you to adjust its value between 10% and 100%. As soon as you adjust the percentage, you can see gold bars stacking up above the fifth reel. The higher your Gold Meter, the easier it is for symbols to arrive on the assigned reel.\n\nEqually interesting and enjoyable are the free spins. With three Scatters, you can activate this bonus, which starts with 8 free spins and can be supplemented by an additional 4 or 8 spins if you find other Scatters on the reels during the round.\n\nOverall, Gold Pile Tigers Pride is a pleasant adventure offering 25 pay lines on which you can challenge your luck. Its structure is unique and far from standard gameplay, but it is interesting for that reason. There are plot twists aplenty, and this is evidenced by the triple chance of jackpots of different values that are up for grabs. Keep an eye on the tiger, as it is true that it can be dangerous, but if you know how to take advantage of its paw, you will be the winner.",

To lower the value, all you need to do is bet on cards from K to 9, made with a delightful Asian style. The Gold Meter plays a key role in the structure with its 25 paylines, increasing the value of the bet.

The structure, as we said, is particular and far from the standard gaming canons, but it is made interesting for this reason. Surprises are not lacking, and this is demonstrated by the triple possibility of jackpots at different values that are up for grabs.

Rarestone Gaming (Playtech) has developed this game that combines the world of animals and the desert theme.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nGold Pile Tigers Pride has medium-high volatility and an RTP fixed at 96.47%. Players can try to win Mini and Maxi awards by forming 5 combinations, and can also try their luck for the Grand prize. The amount of betting played plays a key role in determining the win.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nTigers and their imprint are the symbols with the highest value, followed by the emerald ring, the tiger's tooth, its statue, and the luxurious vase. The value decreases with cards from K to 9, which are made with an Asian-style. The Gold Meter plays a key role with its 25 paylines, increasing the value of the bet. The Mini, Maxi, and Grand jackpots are available depending on the amount of betting.\n\nExtra Features\n\nThe Gold Meter is located on the left side of the grid and can be adjusted with a value ranging from 10% to 100%. The higher the Gold Meter, the easier it will be for symbols to arrive on the fifth reel. Free spins can be activated with three Scatters, which starts with eight, and then adds 4 or 8 additional spins if more Scatters appear during the round. \n\nFree Spins\n\nGold Pile Tigers Pride offers free spins that can be activated with three Scatters. This results in 8 free spins that can be increased to 12 or 16 spins if more Scatters appear during the round. Free spins offer a high chance of winning big rewards.\n\n        \n            ",

Are you ready to search for rich treasures? Gold is your mission and must be accomplished. You can try to form 5 combinations and thus try to win Mini and Maxi awards, or try your luck for the Grand prize. To do so, however, you will have to take advantage of the extra features, the Scatter and make use of the free spins.\n\nThis video slot has 5 reels and is signed by Rarestone Gaming (Playtech) who has decided to perfectly combine the mix between the world of animals and the desert theme. Unusual perhaps, especially for those who have been involved in long-distance gaming for some time? Not really, because it is an interesting combo that could strike the players.\n\nGraphics of Gold Pile Tigers Pride\n\nAmong the symbols with the highest value, the great protagonist clearly has to be the tiger, followed closely by its imprint which is the Wild. They are capable of distributing up to 50,000 and 40,000 coin prizes respectively. They are then joined by the emerald ring, the tiger's tooth and its statue, as well as the luxurious vase. To lower the value, all you need to do is bet on cards from K to 9, made with a delightful Asian style. The Gold Meter plays a key role in the structure with its 25 paylines, increasing the value of the bet. But be careful: you will also be in the desert among dangerous animals, but it is betting that plays a key role. In fact, depending on how much you bet, the Mini, Maxi and Grand prizes may vary. It may not be an immediate thing for new players, but don't worry: a few rounds of practice are enough to get into the gameplay, or simply consult the table of payments.\n\nSpecial features\n\nLet's go back to the Gold Meter, mentioned above, which is perhaps the best extra feature that has been thought up by the developers. It is located on the left side of the grid and can be adjusted with a value ranging from 10% to 100%. When you act on the percentage, you can see the gold bars stack up on the fifth reel. It's easy to say that the higher your Gold Meter, the easier it will be for symbols to arrive on the assigned reel.\n\nEqually interesting and enjoyable are the free spins: with three Scatters, you can activate this bonus that starts with 8, and then adds 4 or 8 additional spins if you find other Scatters on the reels during the round.\n\nFinal considerations on Gold Pile Tigers Pride\n\nThe adventure is there, it is pleasant and offers you 25 paylines on which to have fun challenging your luck. The structure, as we said, is particular and far from the standard gaming canons, but it is made interesting for this reason. Surprises are not lacking, and this is demonstrated by the triple possibility of jackpots at different values that are up for grabs. Watch out for the tiger, because it is true that it can be dangerous, but if you know how to take advantage of its paw, you will be the winner.\n            ",

Are you ready to search for rich treasures? Gold is your mission and must be accomplished. You can try to form 5 combinations and thus try to win Mini and Maxi awards, or try your luck for the Grand prize. To do so, however, you will have to take advantage of the extra features, the Scatter and make use of the free spins.\n\nThis video slot has 5 reels and is signed by Rarestone Gaming (Playtech) who has decided to perfectly combine the mix between the world of animals and the desert theme. Unusual perhaps, especially for those who have been involved in long-distance gaming for some time? Not really, because it is an interesting combo that could strike the players.\n\nGraphics of Gold Pile Tigers Pride\n\nAmong the symbols with the highest value, the great protagonist clearly has to be the tiger, followed closely by its imprint which is the Wild. They are capable of distributing up to 50,000 and 40,000 coin prizes respectively. They are then joined by the emerald ring, the tiger's tooth and its statue, as well as the luxurious vase. To lower the value, all you need to do is bet on cards from K to 9, made with a delightful Asian style. The Gold Meter plays a key role in the structure with its 25 paylines, increasing the value of the bet. But be careful: you will also be in the desert among dangerous animals, but it is betting that plays a key role. In fact, depending on how much you bet, the Mini, Maxi and Grand prizes may vary. It may not be an immediate thing for new players, but don't worry: a few rounds of practice are enough to get into the gameplay, or simply consult the table of payments.\n\nSpecial features\n\nLet's go back to the Gold Meter, mentioned above, which is perhaps the best extra feature that has been thought up by the developers. It is located on the left side of the grid and can be adjusted with a value ranging from 10% to 100%. When you act on the percentage, you can see the gold bars stack up on the fifth reel. It's easy to say that the higher your Gold Meter, the easier it will be for symbols to arrive on the assigned reel.\n\nEqually interesting and enjoyable are the free spins: with three Scatters, you can activate this bonus that starts with 8, and then adds 4 or 8 additional spins if you find other Scatters on the reels during the round.\n\nFinal considerations on Gold Pile Tigers Pride\n\nThe adventure is there, it is pleasant and offers you 25 paylines on which to have fun challenging your luck. The structure, as we said, is particular and far from the standard gaming canons, but it is made interesting for this reason. Surprises are not lacking, and this is demonstrated by the triple possibility of jackpots at different values that are up for grabs. Watch out for the tiger, because it is true that it can be dangerous, but if you know how to take advantage of its paw, you will be the winner.\n        ",
