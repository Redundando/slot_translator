La cultura ellenica con i suoi miti, le sue leggende e le sue divinità, è un tema vastissimo e che offre la possibilità di scegliere tra gli innumerevoli protagonisti della sua storia.\nQuesta slot machine prodotta dalla software house Novomatic è incentrata sulla figura della bella Elena di Troia, conosciuta anche come Elena di Sparta, figlia di Zeus in persona e famosa per la sua bellezza che fece cadere ai suoi piedi alcuni tra i più valorosi combattenti, scatenando addirittura delle guerre tra i pretendenti.\nElena era ovviamente una donna molto facoltosa, che amava circondarsi di ricchezze e di godere della gloria derivante dalla sua posizione; questi concetti di bellezza e ricchezza si rispecchiano sui rulli dell’Helena  di casa Novomatic, che propone una slot dal punto di vista grafico molto bella e ricercata, a partire dalla schermata iniziale che mostra la nostra protagonista stagliarsi in tutto il suo splendore sullo sfondo di un tramonto arancione che mette in luce anche un caratteristico tempio.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nHelena è una slot con una griglia di gioco strutturata in maniera tradizionale, con cinque rulli, tre righe e dieci linee di pagamento, e con i tasti per il settaggio posti sulla parte inferiore della schermata che includono anche l’opzione Autoplay, grazie alla quale si può giocare in maniera automatica impostando un numero predefinito di giri.\nSu Helena si possono effettuare le proprie scommesse a partire da solo dieci centesimi fino a un massimo di 100 €, range questo che mette d’accordo tutti, sia i “giocatori di penny” sia gli high rollers. Il premio massimo che si può ottenere grazie a questa slot è pari a 40.000 monete, niente male!\nLa volatilità di Helena è media mentre il ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP) si attesta su un decisamente poco entusiasmante 95,12%, di quasi un punto al di sotto della media.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Helena\nTra i simboli che troviamo sui rulli di Helena ci sono in primo luogo le classiche carte da gioco, in questo caso solo dal 10 all’Asso. Per ottenere delle buone vincite però, bisogna aspettare i simboli tematici, che comprendono un vaso di terracotta, Paride di Troia e l’eroe Achille, detto il Pelide. Sia Achille che Paride sono simboli ad alto valore, che pagano 3.000 volte la puntata quando compaiono su tutti i cinque rulli.\nIl simbolo Wild del gioco non poteva non essere la bella Elena che, oltre ad avere una funzione di jolly, può determinare da sola delle combinazioni vincenti che pagano fino a 40.000 monete quando è su tutti i rulli. Il simbolo Scatter è invece rappresentato da un’alba e se compare per almeno tre volte assegna 15 giri gratuiti.\n",

The Hellenic culture with its myths, legends, and deities is a vast topic that offers the possibility to choose from the countless protagonists of its history.\n\nThis slot machine produced by Novomatic is centered around the figure of the beautiful Helen of Troy, also known as Helen of Sparta, daughter of Zeus himself and famous for her beauty that made some of the bravest fighters fall at her feet, even unleashing wars between suitors.\n\nHelen was obviously a very wealthy woman who loved to surround herself with riches and to enjoy the glory deriving from her position. These concepts of beauty and wealth are reflected on the reels of Helena by Novomatic, which offers a visually stunning and refined slot, starting from the initial screen that shows our protagonist standing out in all her splendor against the backdrop of an orange sunset that highlights a characteristic temple.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nHelena is a slot with a game grid structured in a traditional way, with five reels, three rows, and ten paylines, and with the buttons for setting placed at the bottom of the screen, which also include the Autoplay option, thanks to which you can play automatically by setting a predefined number of spins.\n\nOn Helena, you can place your bets starting from just ten cents up to a maximum of 100 €, a range that caters to everyone, both penny players and high rollers. The maximum prize that can be obtained thanks to this slot is equal to 40,000 coins, not bad!\n\nThe volatility of Helena is medium while the theoretical return to player (RTP) stands at a decidedly unenthusiastic 95.12%, almost one point below the average.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Helena\n\nAmong the symbols that can be found on Helena's reels, there are firstly the classic playing cards, in this case only from 10 to Ace. However, to obtain good winnings, you must wait for the thematic symbols, which include a terracotta vase, Paris of Troy, and the hero Achilles, known as the Pelide. Both Achilles and Paris are high-value symbols, paying 3,000 times the bet when they appear on all five reels.\n\nThe Wild symbol of the game could not be other than the beautiful Helena who, in addition to having a wildcard function, can alone determine winning combinations that pay up to 40,000 coins when it appears on all reels. The Scatter symbol is instead represented by a dawn, and if it appears at least three times, it awards 15 free spins.\n            ",

But don't worry, you can still place bets starting at a measly ten cents all the way up to a maximum bet of 100€.</p><p>But let's talk about the good stuff. The game features a Wild symbol that can help you win big by substituting for other symbols to create winning combinations. In fact, if you get a Wild symbol on all five reels, you're in for a whopping 40,000 coin payout! And let's not forget about the Scatter symbol - if you get at least three of them, you'll activate 15 free spins. Who needs to pay to spin when you can just get them for free, am I right?</p>\"\n}"

It has a game grid structured in a traditional way, with the buttons for setting placed at the bottom of the screen, which also include the Autoplay option, thanks to which you can play automatically by setting a predefined number of spins.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols that can be found on Helena's reels include both classic playing cards (from 10 to Ace) and thematic symbols, such as a terracotta vase, Paris of Troy, and the hero Achilles. Both Achilles and Paris are high-value symbols, paying 3,000 times the bet when they appear on all five reels. The Wild symbol of the game is Helena herself, who has a wildcard function and can alone determine winning combinations that pay up to 40,000 coins when it appears on all reels. The Scatter symbol is represented by a dawn and, if it appears at least three times, it awards 15 free spins.\n\nBetting Range\n\nOn Helena, you can place your bets starting from just ten cents up to a maximum of 100 €, making it a range that caters to everyone, both penny players and high rollers. The maximum prize that can be obtained thanks to this slot is equal to 40,000 coins, which is a decent payout.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nThe volatility of Helena is medium, meaning there is a good balance between the frequency of payouts and the amount of each payout. The theoretical return to player (RTP) stands at a below-average 95.12%, almost one point lower than what is typically seen in online slot games.\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nIf the Scatter symbol, represented by a dawn, appears at least three times, the player is awarded 15 free spins. This is a feature that increases the player's chances of winning without having to place additional bets. During the free spins rounds, all winnings are tripled, which is a great extra that adds to the overall excitement of the game.\n\n        \n            ",

The Hellenic culture with its myths, legends, and deities is a vast topic that offers the possibility to choose from the countless protagonists of its history.\n\nThis slot machine produced by Novomatic is centered around the figure of the beautiful Helen of Troy, also known as Helen of Sparta, daughter of Zeus himself and famous for her beauty that made some of the bravest fighters fall at her feet, even unleashing wars between suitors.\n\nHelen was obviously a very wealthy woman who loved to surround herself with riches and to enjoy the glory deriving from her position. These concepts of beauty and wealth are reflected on the reels of Helena by Novomatic, which offers a visually stunning and refined slot, starting from the initial screen that shows our protagonist standing out in all her splendor against the backdrop of an orange sunset that highlights a characteristic temple.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nHelena is a slot with a game grid structured in a traditional way, with five reels, three rows, and ten paylines, and with the buttons for setting placed at the bottom of the screen, which also include the Autoplay option, thanks to which you can play automatically by setting a predefined number of spins.\n\nOn Helena, you can place your bets starting from just ten cents up to a maximum of 100 €, a range that caters to everyone, both penny players and high rollers. The maximum prize that can be obtained thanks to this slot is equal to 40,000 coins, not bad!\n\nThe volatility of Helena is medium while the theoretical return to player (RTP) stands at a decidedly unenthusiastic 95.12%, almost one point below the average.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Helena\n\nAmong the symbols that can be found on Helena's reels, there are firstly the classic playing cards, in this case only from 10 to Ace. However, to obtain good winnings, you must wait for the thematic symbols, which include a terracotta vase, Paris of Troy, and the hero Achilles, known as the Pelide. Both Achilles and Paris are high-value symbols, paying 3,000 times the bet when they appear on all five reels.\n\nThe Wild symbol of the game could not be other than the beautiful Helena who, in addition to having a wildcard function, can alone determine winning combinations that pay up to 40,000 coins when it appears on all reels. The Scatter symbol is instead represented by a dawn, and if it appears at least three times, it awards 15 free spins.\n            ",
