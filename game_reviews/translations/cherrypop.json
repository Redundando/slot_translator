Per questo ci sentiamo di dover fare un plauso alla AvatarUX Studios che è riuscita a creare una slot con un gameplay originale senza perdere la semplicità tipica delle sue produzioni.

Per quel che riguarda i suoni, si è puntato su un suono monocorde, con il caratteristico pop che si verifica ogni qualvolta uno o più simboli esplodono per lasciare posto agli altri.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nSi parte con una caratteristica griglia con 5 rulli e 3 linee, ma a seguito delle combinazioni vincenti viene aggiunta una linea superiore in corrispondenza della linea vincente. La griglia si può espandere sino a un massimo di 6 linee superiori in modalità normale e 9 nei Free Spins. Con una puntata minima di 0,20 € e la massima 40 €, Cherrypop si configura come una slot adatta ai novizi ma anche ai giocatori più esperti. I modi per vincere sono 59.049 e si vince se i simboli identici appaiono su rulli adiacenti, al di là della loro posizione.

After winning combinations, an additional row is added to the top of the winning row, and the grid can expand up to a maximum of 6 upper rows in regular mode and 9 in Free Spins. The game has a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €40, making it suitable for both novice players and experienced gamblers. You can also choose to have anywhere between 10 and 1,000 auto-spins, or no limit and decide when to stop them yourself.\n\nSymbols and Payouts\n\nCherryPop uses the PopWins mode, which means that every time there is a winning combination, the winning symbols explode, and the grid expands by one row. The symbols include low-value playing cards from nine to ace, high-value ones like grapes, watermelons, oranges, horseshoes, clovers, bells, and diamonds, and the highest value ones: cherries enclosed in a soap bubble. Winnings occur when identical symbols appear on adjacent rows, regardless of their position. Unlocking all six rows on the reels triggers 5 Free Spins.\n\nPopWins mode\n\nCherryPop's PopWins mode triggers every time there is a winning combination. The winning symbols explode, and the grid expands by one row, with two new symbols landing on the reels.\n\nFree Spins\n\nUnlocking all six rows on the reels triggers 5 Free Spins. Before that, a wheel appears, offering a variable number of additional Free Spins, up to a maximum of 12. There is also the possibility of losing everything and not playing at all in the free mode. During Free Spins, the grid can expand up to 9 rows, and you start with a x2 multiplier, which increases by 1 after each win. If you manage to unlock the entire grid, you get an immediate +3 to the multiplier and subsequent +3 for each win.\n\nGraphics\n\nCherryPop has excellent graphics, with symbols that are brightly colored and defined. The monotonous sound used is a characteristic 'pop' that occurs whenever one or more symbols explodes to make room for others. The buttons we need to set up our game, including the start button and the auto-spin button, are located on the right side of the game screen.\n\n        \n            ",

The minimum bet is €0.20, while the maximum is €40, making it suitable for both novice players and experienced gamblers. There are 59,049 ways to win, and winnings occur when identical symbols appear on adjacent rows, regardless of their position. CherryPop also allows players to set up anywhere between 10 and 1,000 auto-spins, or choose to have no limit and decide when to stop them yourself.\n\nExpanding Grid and Symbols\n\nCherryPop's gameplay involves an expanding grid that adds a new row to the top of the winning row after each winning combination. This allows the grid to expand up to six rows in regular mode and nine rows in Free Spins mode, resulting in more ways to win. The symbols used in the game are well-defined, with bright colors that enhance the slot's appeal. There are low-value symbols, represented by playing cards from 9 to Ace, high-value symbols like grapes, watermelons, oranges, horseshoes, clovers, bells, and diamonds, and the highest value symbol: cherries enclosed in a soap bubble.\n\nPopWins Mode and Bonus Features\n\nCherryPop's PopWins mode is activated every time there is a winning combination, causing the winning symbols to explode and the grid to expand by one row, with two new symbols landing on the reels. Unlocking all six rows triggers a total of 5 Free Spins, with a chance to earn additional free spins by spinning a variable wheel that can offer up to 12 additional Free Spins. During Free Spins, the grid can expand up to a maximum of 9 rows, and players start with a x2 multiplier that increases by 1 after each win. Unlocking the entire grid triggers an immediate +3 to the multiplier and subsequent +3 for each additional win.\n\nPayouts and Symbols\n\nCherryPop has 59,049 ways to win, and players can win by matching identical symbols on adjacent rows, regardless of their position. The playing cards from 9 to Ace represent the low-value symbols, while the high-value symbols include grapes, watermelons, oranges, horseshoes, clovers, bells, and diamonds. The highest value symbols are cherries enclosed in a soap bubble. In Free Spins mode, the maximum payout multiplier starts at x2 but can increase up to x41 after unlocking the entire grid.\n\nGraphics and Visual Appeal\n\nCherryPop features impressive graphics, with well-defined symbols and bright colors that enhance the slot's appeal. AvatarUX Studios did an excellent job of creating a slot with original gameplay without sacrificing the simplicity that characterizes its productions. Sound effects are minimal but effective, with a characteristic 'pop' that occurs whenever one or more symbols explode.

That's why we want to give AvatarUX Studios credit for creating a slot with original gameplay without sacrificing the simplicity that characterizes its productions. Before delving into the mechanics of CherryPop's gameplay, we want to take a moment to appreciate the impressive graphics, another strong point of the Chinese company. The symbols are excellently defined, with bright colors that enhance the slot's appeal. On the right side, we find all the buttons we need to set up our game, including the start button and the auto-spin button. As for sound, a monotonous tone is used, with a characteristic \"pop\" that occurs whenever one or more symbols explode to make room for others. \n\nSlot features\nWe start with a grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, but after winning combinations, an additional row is added at the top of the winning row. The grid can expand up to a maximum of 6 upper rows in regular mode and 9 in Free Spins. With a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €40, CherryPop is suitable for both novice players and experienced gamblers. There are 59,049 ways to win, and winnings occur when identical symbols appear on adjacent rows, regardless of their position. You can set up anywhere between 10 and 1,000 auto-spins, or choose to have no limit and decide when to stop them yourself. \n\nSymbols and features\nAs mentioned above, CherryPop uses the PopWins mode: every time there is a winning combination, the winning symbols explode, and the grid expands by one row, with two new symbols landing on the reels.\n\nAs for winnings, we can divide symbols into low-value ones, represented by playing cards from nine to ace, high-value ones like grapes, watermelons, oranges, horseshoes, clovers, bells, and diamonds, and finally, the highest value ones: cherries enclosed in a soap bubble.\n\nUnlocking all six rows on the reels triggers 5 Free Spins. Before that, a wheel appears, offering a variable number of additional Free Spins, up to a maximum of 12. There is also the possibility of losing everything and not playing at all in the free mode. During Free Spins, the grid can expand up to 9 rows, and you start with a x2 multiplier, which increases by 1 after each win. If you manage to unlock the entire grid, you get an immediate +3 to the multiplier and subsequent +3 for each win.\n            ",

That's why we want to give AvatarUX Studios credit for creating a slot with original gameplay without sacrificing the simplicity that characterizes its productions. Before delving into the mechanics of CherryPop's gameplay, we want to take a moment to appreciate the impressive graphics, another strong point of the Chinese company. The symbols are excellently defined, with bright colors that enhance the slot's appeal. On the right side, we find all the buttons we need to set up our game, including the start button and the auto-spin button. As for sound, a monotonous tone is used, with a characteristic \"pop\" that occurs whenever one or more symbols explode to make room for others. \n\nSlot features\nWe start with a grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, but after winning combinations, an additional row is added at the top of the winning row. The grid can expand up to a maximum of 6 upper rows in regular mode and 9 in Free Spins. With a minimum bet of €0.20 and a maximum of €40, CherryPop is suitable for both novice players and experienced gamblers. There are 59,049 ways to win, and winnings occur when identical symbols appear on adjacent rows, regardless of their position. You can set up anywhere between 10 and 1,000 auto-spins, or choose to have no limit and decide when to stop them yourself. \n\nSymbols and features\nAs mentioned above, CherryPop uses the PopWins mode: every time there is a winning combination, the winning symbols explode, and the grid expands by one row, with two new symbols landing on the reels.\n\nAs for winnings, we can divide symbols into low-value ones, represented by playing cards from nine to ace, high-value ones like grapes, watermelons, oranges, horseshoes, clovers, bells, and diamonds, and finally, the highest value ones: cherries enclosed in a soap bubble.\n\nUnlocking all six rows on the reels triggers 5 Free Spins. Before that, a wheel appears, offering a variable number of additional Free Spins, up to a maximum of 12. There is also the possibility of losing everything and not playing at all in the free mode. During Free Spins, the grid can expand up to 9 rows, and you start with a x2 multiplier, which increases by 1 after each win. If you manage to unlock the entire grid, you get an immediate +3 to the multiplier and subsequent +3 for each win.\n            ",
