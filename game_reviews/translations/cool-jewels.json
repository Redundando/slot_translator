La grafica è ridotta veramente all’essenziale e, se non si sapesse aprendo il gioco che si tratta di una slot machine, si potrebbe tranquillamente scambiare Cool Jewels per uno dei tanti giochi online della serie Candy Crush Saga o Bubble Witch.\nLo sfondo di colore azzurro cielo mette in risalto la griglia su cui scorrono i simboli rappresentati tutti da pietre preziose di forma e colori diversi.\nNon ci sono ovviamente animazioni di nessun tipo, figuriamoci effetti speciali o tecnologie in 3D, Cool Jewels punta tutto sul gameplay, strizzando un occhio a quei giocatori che sono rimasti legati alle vecchie slot machine da sala bar, che possono ritrovare in questo gioco un piacevole ritorno alle origini dei giochi di slot per quanto riguarda il compartimento grafico, ma saranno piacevolmente sorpresi nel trovare poi un gameplay divertente, articolato e molto moderno.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot\nCool Jewels è una slot che potrebbe essere definita in qualche modo anomala: a una grafica ridotta ai minimi termini associa una modalità di gioco che è invece complessa e molto coinvolgente.\nSi può notare questo anche da una prima occhiata: si può subito vedere subito che anche la struttura di gioco non è quella tradizionale, ma che il classico schema 5 rulli e 3 righe è sostituito da una griglia 6×6.\nAltra particolarità è che non esistono linee di pagamento, sostituite da dei contatori che si trovano ai lati dei rulli. Le scommesse dunque non vanno per linea ma per giro, e sono comprese tra un minimo di 0,50 monete fino a un massimo di 200, per accontentare sia i giocatori più prudenti sia i cosiddetti high rollers.\nInteressanti le possibilità di vincita: giocando a Cool Jewels si può ambire a un premio massimo pari a ben 7.500 volte il valore della puntata.\nIl ritorno teorico al giocator (return to player o RTP)e di questa slot machine è in linea con la maggior parte dei giochi della William Interactive, attestandosi su un canonico 96,1%.\nSimboli e funzionalità speciali di Cool Jewels\nIn questo gioco a farla da protagonisti sono i gioielli, di tutte le forme e di tutti i colori, tra cui il rosso, il giallo, il turchese, rosa, blu e verde. Per ottenere delle vincite è necessario che si presenti una combinazione di almeno quattro simboli identici su rulli adiacenti, sia in senso orizzontale che in senso verticale. Tra i simboli ne troviamo anche uno che rappresenta un moltiplicatore x10: quando si ottengono delle combinazioni vincenti con questo simbolo l’intera vincita sarà moltiplicata per dieci volte.\nCool Jewels presenta diverse tipologie di Wild, ben quattro: Shocking Wild, Unstable Wild, Shattering Wild, e Persisting Wild. L’Actived Unstable Wild distruggerà tutti i simboli negli spazi che lo circondano, un Shattering Wild attivato distruggerà tutti i simboli adiacenti sia in senso verticale che orizzontale e lo  Shocking Wild attivato infine distruggerà tutti i simboli adiacenti collocati in diagonale rispetto ad esso.\n",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics and design\n\nCool Jewels is a slot machine that associates minimalistic graphics with a game mode that is complex and engaging. The classic 5-reel and 3-row pattern is replaced by a 6x6 grid, and there are no pay lines, replaced by counters that are found on the sides of the reels. Bets range from a minimum of 0.50 coins to a maximum of 200 coins, and players can aspire to a maximum prize equal to up to 7,500 times the value of the bet.\n\nSymbols and pay structure\n\nThe game features variously shaped and colored precious stones, including red, yellow, turquoise, pink, blue, and green. To obtain winnings, it is necessary to have at least four identical symbols in adjacent columns or rows, both horizontally and vertically. A symbol representing a x10 multiplier is also present.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and Features\n\nUnlike most slot machines, Cool Jewels has a complex and engaging gameplay. The game structure is not traditional, with a 6x6 grid instead of the classic 5-reel and 3-row pattern. There are no pay lines, but counters on the sides of the reels substitute them. Bets range from a minimum of 0.50 coins to a maximum of 200 while aspiring to a maximum prize equal to up to 7,500 times the bet. Cool Jewels features several types of Wilds: Shocking Wild, Unstable Wild, Shattering Wild, and Persisting Wild, which destroy symbols in different ways and directions. \n\nBetting Range and Payouts\n\nCool Jewels offers a total turn to place bets instead of maximum or minimum line bets, ranging from 0.50 coins to 200 coins. The maximum prize achievable is up to 7,500 times the bet. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.1%, which is in line with most slot games from Williams Interactive.\n\nSymbols and Winning\n\nCool Jewels is themed around jewels of red, yellow, turquoise, pink, blue, and green. Winning combinations need at least four identical symbols in adjacent columns or rows (horizontally or vertically). Symbols also include a x10 multiplier, which multiplies the entire prize ten times when involved in winning combinations.\n\nWilds and Multipliers\n\nCool Jewels features four types of Wilds: Shocking Wild, Unstable Wild, Shattering Wild, and Persisting Wild. Activated Unstable Wild destroys symbols around it, Activated Shattering Wild destroys adjacent symbols vertically and horizontally, and Activated Shocking Wild destroys adjacent symbols placed diagonally. There is also a x10 multiplier that multiplies the entire prize ten times when involved in winning combinations.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nCool Jewels has a minimalistic design with a sky blue background highlighting the 6x6 grid on which symbols represented by different shaped and colored precious stones roll. There are no animations, 3D technology, or special effects. Cool Jewels aims to focus on gameplay rather than graphics, which winks to old slot machines found in bars. While those who enjoy modern graphics and animation may not find Cool Jewels very engaging, those who appreciate the origins of slot games will find its graphic design appealing.\n\n        \n            ",

The graphics are really reduced to the essential and if one didn't know that it was a slot game, one could easily mistake Cool Jewels for one of the many online games in the Candy Crush Saga or Bubble Witch series. The sky blue background highlights the grid on which symbols represented by different shaped and colored precious stones scroll by. Naturally, there are no animations of any kind, let alone 3D technology or special effects; Cool Jewels focuses everything on gameplay and winks to those players who have remained attached to the old slot machines found in bars, which can find in this game a pleasant return to the origins of slot games in terms of graphic design, but will be pleasantly surprised to find a fun, articulate and very modern gameplay.\n\nMain features of the slot\n\nCool Jewels is a slot that could be defined in some way anomalous: it associates minimalistic graphics with a game mode that is complex and engaging. One can notice this just by taking a first glance: you can immediately see that even the game structure is not traditional, but that the classic 5-reel and 3-row pattern is replaced by a 6x6 grid. Another particularity is that there are no pay lines, replaced by counters that are found on the sides of the reels. Bets, therefore, do not go for maximum or minimum line bet, but for the total turn, ranging from a minimum of 0.50 coins to a maximum of 200, in order to satisfy both the more cautious players and the so-called high rollers. The possibilities for winning is interesting: by playing Cool Jewels you can aspire to a maximum prize equal to up to 7,500 times the value of the bet. \n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) of this slot machine is in line with most of the games from William Interactive, standing at a canonical 96.1%.\n\nSymbols and special features of Cool Jewels\n\nIn this game, the protagonist is all about jewels, of all shapes and colors, including red, yellow, turquoise, pink, blue and green. To obtain winnings, it is necessary to have at least four identical symbols in adjacent columns or rows, both horizontally and vertically. Among the symbols, we also find one that represents a x10 multiplier: when winning combinations are obtained with this symbol, the entire prize is multiplied by ten times.\n\nCool Jewels presents several types of Wilds, four in total: Shocking Wild, Unstable Wild, Shattering Wild, and Persisting Wild. The Activated Unstable Wild destroys all symbols in the spaces around it, an Activated Shattering Wild destroys all adjacent symbols both vertically and horizontally, and the Activated Shocking Wild finally destroys all adjacent symbols placed diagonally to it.\n        ",
