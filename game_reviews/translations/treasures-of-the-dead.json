The minimum bet is 0.10 virtual coins for the demo game, and the maximum is 200 coins, with a maximum payout of 15,000x the bet. Autoplay is available, making it easy for players to play a high number of spins without clicking the play button every time. The Turbo button is also available in two levels: fast and super-fast, to speed up gameplay. The game's volatility is medium/high, and the RTP rate is 96.2%.\n\nSpecial Symbols and Functions\n\nSymbol values range from the lowest paying playing cards to the high paying cat statue, pharaoh, and sarcophagus. The book is the game's centerpiece, offering various functions. The book can activate Hyperlines, where the left column of the grid is split into three sections, each with three slots. When the book lands on the reels, it could uncover a scarab to fit into one of the slots. Once a part of the column is filled with three scarabs, a multiplier is activated on the next win. The book is also a wildcard, substituting for all other symbols in a winning combo. Additionally, the book is a Scatter, offering random free spins, with the number of spins determined by the book's appearance on the reels.\n\nBonus Features\n\nDuring the Bonus Game, a special symbol can be chosen and expanded while Hyperlines remain active. The special game can be purchased by clicking the appropriate button.\n\nGraphics and Sound Design\n\nTreasures of the Dead features well-designed graphics, with precise, large symbols and columns with slots that house scarabs, which play an essential role in initiating the Bonus game. The sound component is a rock version of typical eastern sounds, adding excitement to the game.\n\nCompatibility with Mobile Devices\n\nThe game's architecture is created with HTML5, making it possible to run the game on all mobile devices and operating systems, including Android and IOS.\n\n        \n            ",

With the brave explorer Amber Wild searching for a magical book that unlocks hidden treasures and priceless riches, players are taken on a journey deep into the pyramid, starting in a golden room and eventually moving into the pharaoh’s chamber during Free Spins. The game's graphics are well-designed, with precise, large symbols and columns with slots that house scarabs, which play an essential role in initiating the Bonus game. The sound component is a rock version of typical eastern sounds, adding excitement to the game.\n\nRegarding gameplay, the slot's reel structure is traditional, utilizing 5 reels and 3 lines with 10 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is 0.10 virtual coins for the demo game, and the maximum is 200 coins, with a maximum payout of 15,000x the bet. Autoplay is available, making it easy for players who wish to play a high number of spins without clicking the play button every time, and the Turbo button is also available in two levels: fast and super-fast, to speed up gameplay. The volatility is medium/high, and the RTP rate is 96.2%.\n\nSymbols can be divided by value, with the lowest paying being playing cards, while the high paying symbols are the cat statue, pharaoh, and sarcophagus. The most lucrative symbol is Amber, followed by the book, which is the game's centerpiece, offering various functions. The book can activate Hyperlines, where the left column of the grid is split into three sections, each with three slots. When the book lands on the reels, it could uncover a scarab to fit into one of the slots. Once a part of the column is filled with three scarabs, a multiplier is activated on the next win. The book is also a wildcard, substituting for all other symbols in a winning combo. Additionally, the book is a Scatter, offering random free spins, with the number of spins determined by the book's appearance on the reels. During the Bonus Game, a special symbol can be chosen and expanded while Hyperlines remain active. The special game can be purchased by clicking the appropriate button.\n\nFAQs:\n- How many free spins can be won with the Scatter?\nIt varies.
