From a graphic and sound point of view, the slot obviously references the old titles that could be found in casinos and game rooms. The grid is embedded in an ocean of flames, conveying a strong sensation of warmth that is also found in the internal symbols. Anyone who has played vintage slots will recognize the BAR sign, the Bell, the number 7, and the Dollar symbol are the undisputed masters of the game grid and the rest of the interface is very minimalist, representing the simplicity of old slots. Even the presence of various jackpots and the rather minimalist music represented by a few seconds loop, that repeats every game play, makes every possible effort to immerse players in this nostalgic atmosphere.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nHot Shot Progressive obviously targets experienced gamblers who are also fans of nostalgic slot games. The graphics and gameplay are designed to evoke the excitement associated with nostalgia for old slots, and Bally has succeeded in reproducing the overall experience for fans of traditional slot machines.\n\nGame Grid and RTP\n\nHot Shot Progressive has a 5x3 game grid with an RTP of 96.03%, which is around the average of modern online slots. The medium volatility of the game is still able to wink at nostalgia thanks to the bonus mode. The game is designed to be simple, with the focus on the BAR sign, the Bell, the number 7, and the Dollar symbol taking center stage. The overall theme and feel of the game is very minimalist, which is in line with the simplicity of old slot machines.\n\nBonus Mode and Jackpots\n\nHot Shot Progressive has five jackpots available: Blazing 7, Diamond Line, Double Jackpot, Triple Jackpot, Blazing Seven Times Pay. These are divided both by the value of the jackpot and combinations, but also based on the characteristics of the mini-reels that we will spin. To activate the bonus mode and get a chance to win the jackpots, players must find at least three jackpot symbols, which can be different from each other. Once activated, the bonus mode lets players spin three reels with a single symbol, with the chance of winning the jackpot and experiencing the excitement of old slot machines.\n\nOverall Experience\n\nHot Shot Progressive is a unique slot game that evokes nostalgia for traditional slot machines, while also offering original functions that will appeal to modern players. The game's graphics and sound effects are designed to transport players to a time when slot machines were simple, but exciting. The game's simplicity in terms of gameplay and design is its strength, and the bonus mode and jackpots give players a chance to win big. Although the game targets experienced gamblers, it is simple enough for beginners to enjoy. Players who enjoy Hot Shot Progressive are likely to enjoy other nostalgic slot games like Seven's and Fruits: 6 Reels from Playson and Twenty Seven from IGT.\n\n        \n            ",

Some choose to move towards the future by proposing titles with ever-changing and attractive functions, while others, such as Bally with Hot Shot Progressive, move in the opposite direction.\n\nThis slot game obviously aims to evoke the excitement associated with nostalgia for old slots, both in terms of graphics and gameplay, with a focus on experienced gamblers. From a graphic and sound point of view, the slot obviously references the old titles that could be found in casinos and game rooms. The grid is embedded in an ocean of flames, conveying a strong sensation of warmth that is also found in the internal symbols.\n\nAnyone who has played vintage slots will recognize them: the BAR sign, the Bell, the number 7, and the Dollar symbol are the undisputed masters of the game grid and the rest of the interface is very minimalist, representing the simplicity of old slots. Even the presence of various jackpots (which we will discuss later) and the rather minimalist music represented by a few seconds loop that repeats every game play, makes every possible effort to immerse us in this nostalgic atmosphere.\n\nWe come to talk about the technical part: although the slot undoubtedly wants to emulate old titles, it does not deviate too much from the modern average of online slots. Inside we find a 5*3 type game grid with an RTP equal to 96.03%. This should make us happy: in the past there was no binding regulation like there is today regarding RTP, and winnings were certainly lower.\n\nWith medium volatility, the slot is still able to wink at nostalgia thanks to the bonus mode: finding at least three jackpot symbols (which can be different from each other) we will have the opportunity to spin three reels with a single symbol, with the chance of winning the jackpot and experiencing the excitement of old slot machines. \n\nThere are five jackpots available: Blazing 7, Diamond Line, Double Jackpot, Triple Jackpot, Blazing Seven Times Pay. These are divided both by the value of the jackpot and combinations, but also based on the characteristics of the mini-reels that we will spin.\n\nIn short: a unique slot game in its kind, very nostalgic but also full of decidedly original functions that will carve out a substantial slice of loyal users.\n\nSimilar slots to Hot Shot Progressive:\n\nBally is clearly not the first and last development company to move on the nostalgic side, as demonstrated by the large number of slots that have the number 7 as a theme. Among these we find Seven's and Fruits: 6 Reels from Playson, Twenty Seven from IGT (highly appreciated in the sector) and Sevens High.\n            ",

Some choose to move towards the future by proposing titles with ever-changing and attractive functions, while others, such as Bally with Hot Shot Progressive, move in the opposite direction.\n\nThis slot game obviously aims to evoke the excitement associated with nostalgia for old slots, both in terms of graphics and gameplay, with a focus on experienced gamblers. From a graphic and sound point of view, the slot obviously references the old titles that could be found in casinos and game rooms. The grid is embedded in an ocean of flames, conveying a strong sensation of warmth that is also found in the internal symbols.\n\nAnyone who has played vintage slots will recognize them: the BAR sign, the Bell, the number 7, and the Dollar symbol are the undisputed masters of the game grid and the rest of the interface is very minimalist, representing the simplicity of old slots. Even the presence of various jackpots (which we will discuss later) and the rather minimalist music represented by a few seconds loop that repeats every game play, makes every possible effort to immerse us in this nostalgic atmosphere.\n\nWe come to talk about the technical part: although the slot undoubtedly wants to emulate old titles, it does not deviate too much from the modern average of online slots. Inside we find a 5*3 type game grid with an RTP equal to 96.03%. This should make us happy: in the past there was no binding regulation like there is today regarding RTP, and winnings were certainly lower.\n\nWith medium volatility, the slot is still able to wink at nostalgia thanks to the bonus mode: finding at least three jackpot symbols (which can be different from each other) we will have the opportunity to spin three reels with a single symbol, with the chance of winning the jackpot and experiencing the excitement of old slot machines. \n\nThere are five jackpots available: Blazing 7, Diamond Line, Double Jackpot, Triple Jackpot, Blazing Seven Times Pay. These are divided both by the value of the jackpot and combinations, but also based on the characteristics of the mini-reels that we will spin.\n\nIn short: a unique slot game in its kind, very nostalgic but also full of decidedly original functions that will carve out a substantial slice of loyal users.\n\nSimilar slots to Hot Shot Progressive:\n\nBally is clearly not the first and last development company to move on the nostalgic side, as demonstrated by the large number of slots that have the number 7 as a theme. Among these we find Seven's and Fruits: 6 Reels from Playson, Twenty Seven from IGT (highly appreciated in the sector) and Sevens High.\n        ",
