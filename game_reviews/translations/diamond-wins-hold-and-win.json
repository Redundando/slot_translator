With five reels, three rows, and ten pay lines, this game is easy to play and understand. And with betting options ranging from 20 cents to a whopping 100 €, there's plenty of room for big wins and potentially embarrassing losses. </p> <p>The wild symbol acts as a wildcard in this game, helping you to create more winning combos. However, we were disappointed to discover that there's no scatter symbol in Diamond Wins: Hold and Win. We're used to scatter symbols triggering free spins and all sorts of cool bonus features, so this seems like a missed opportunity. </p> <p>That being said, the bonus game is still pretty exciting. To trigger it, you need to land six or more diamonds on the board at once. When this happens, those diamonds will hold in place while you get three respins. If you land more diamonds during these respins, they will join the original diamonds in holding position for another three turns. This can keep happening until all 15 positions are filled with diamonds, at which point you'll win the grand prize. </p> <p>We had fun playing Diamond Wins: Hold and Win, but we think it could use a bit more pizzazz. Maybe they could add a disco ball that drops down during the bonus feature to really get things grooving. Or they could let you choose a character to represent you on the reels. We'd love to see a game where you play as a cat and all the symbols are yarn balls and catnip. Now that would be a purrfect slot game! </p>"

With five reels, three rows, and ten pay lines, this game is easy to play and understand. And with betting options ranging from 20 cents to a whopping 100 €, there's plenty of room for big wins and potentially embarrassing losses. </p> <p>The wild symbol acts as a wildcard in this game, helping you to create more winning combos. However, we were disappointed to discover that there's no scatter symbol in Diamond Wins: Hold and Win. We're used to scatter symbols triggering free spins and all sorts of cool bonus features, so this seems like a missed opportunity. </p> <p>That being said, the bonus game is still pretty exciting. To trigger it, you need to land six or more diamonds on the board at once. When this happens, those diamonds will hold in place while you get three respins. If you land more diamonds during these respins, they will join the original diamonds in holding position for another three turns. This can keep happening until all 15 positions are filled with diamonds, at which point you'll win the grand prize. </p> <p>We had fun playing Diamond Wins: Hold and Win, but we think it could use a bit more pizzazz. Maybe they could add a disco ball that drops down during the bonus feature to really get things grooving. Or they could let you choose a character to represent you on the reels. We'd love to see a game where you play as a cat and all the symbols are yarn balls and catnip. Now that would be a purrfect slot game! </p>\"\n}"

The icons represented on the reels were usually colorful fruits, diamonds or images representing the number 7, the bell or the BAR symbol.\n\nOver the decades, up to the present day, slot machines have become increasingly technological, with original themes and stunning special effects. However, games that reproduce the style of old arcade machines continue to exist and count on a large cult following of nostalgic and passionate gamers.\n\nDiamond Wins: Hold and Win is a slot machine dedicated to you, vintage lovers! \n\nFeaturing a simplistic design, this game uses the icons that have made history in slot machines: here too we find colorful fruits, bells, the number 7 and of course, diamonds! \n\nSo, if you're looking for a slot machine with a simple design, a retro flavor, but with an interesting gameplay and potential to win big, well, then Diamond Wins: Hold and Win may be the right one for you! \n\nKey features of the slot machine\n\nThe Diamond Wins: Hold and Win game board has a very classic structure with five reels, three rows and ten pay lines, on which you can bet from a minimum of 20 cents up to a maximum of 100 €, not bad for a classic slot!\n\nYou won't find particularly innovative special functions in Diamond Wins: Hold and Win, but you can count on the Wild symbol and on three Jackpots: Mini, Major and Grand, with the latter being worth a thousand times the value of your bet.\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) is a bit disappointing: at 95.52%, it is slightly below the average of slot games.\n\nOverall, we can say that Diamond Wins: Hold and Win is a game that may not fully satisfy lovers of intricate gameplay, but that could certainly be appreciated by those who go straight to the point and by those who are approaching the world of slot machines for the first time.\n\nSymbols and special functions of Diamond Wins: Hold and Win\n\nThe symbols you can find on the reels of Diamond Wins: Hold and Win are those belonging to the tradition of old arcade machines, namely colorful fruits, the number 7, the bell and diamonds. \n\nThere is a Wild symbol, that acts as a wild card, but there is no Scatter. \n\nThe special functions of Diamond Wins: Hold and Win are only two: one is linked to the Wild symbol (the number 7), while the other is the bonus game that starts when six or more diamonds appear on the board. During the bonus game, you can have the chance to be awarded one of the three Jackpots and to take home the maximum win of 1,000 times the bet!\n        ",
