Bier Haus Oktoberfest is a delightful gem for the digital gaming industry, created by WMS, who have signed a series of sexy machines with this concept. It's a sort of saga that you can try for the first time if you haven't had the chance to try your luck. The gamer has the opportunity to celebrate the famous event that puts beer love at the center of the festivities. And even though the event usually takes place between September and October, this year you can participate as many times as you want and have fun challenging luck, even in the summer. You'll be struck by its gameplay structure, but also by the features that the provider has thought of offering gamers. And let's not forget its RTP, set at 96.18%.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nThe entire Bier Haus series has deliberately chosen to maintain a similar frame for all its updated versions. And that's what we notice graphically even for this slot dedicated to Oktoberfest. This means that you will be facing an attractive girl named Heidi and the charming drinker Hans. With them, there are no shortage of beer mugs, musical instruments, typical Bavarian hats, and card game icons. There are no major aesthetic changes, but certainly the visual quality that WMS applies to its games is always one of the most original. The structure is interesting because we don't have a classic gaming area, but the grid is a 6x6 with 50 paylines and the possibility of winning up to 1,388 times the bet. But even more curious is the ability to trigger one of its Mega Drop Jackpots, unlocking Minor, Major or Epic, which of course has a different growth and limit.\n\nYour betting range is between 0.18 and 180 coins, and generally, the winnings you get are medium-sized, of course, if you're in the base game. While they increase when you activate its extra features. Among these, we mention the Beer Wild, with the possibility that the reels will fill up with beer, although in our gaming experience, it's quite rare. At that point, you'll see three versions of the Scatter Heidi, which can attribute free spins or jackpots and staggering wins.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Bier Haus Oktoberfest slot\nThe issue of Mega Drop jackpots that can trigger at a certain amount is very nice, but above all, it's the Wild that will help you conquer some good wins. First of all, because it's very valid compared to the theme treated, and then because it has a very effective power.\nBier Haus Oktoberfest is therefore an interesting slot that knows how to entertain and reward patient and lucky players. It's not one of the most innovative online machines, but it has everything it takes to make a gambler happy.

Bier Haus Oktoberfest is a delightful gem for the digital gaming industry, created by WMS, who has signed a series of machines with this concept. A sort of saga that you can try for the first time if you haven't already tried your luck. The gamer has the opportunity to celebrate the famous event that revolves around the love for beer. And even though the event usually takes place between September and October, this year you can participate whenever you want and have fun challenging your luck, even in the middle of summer. You'll be struck by the game's structure, but also by the functions that the provider has thought of to offer gamers. And let's not forget its RTP fixed at 96.18%.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nThe entire Bier Haus series has deliberately decided to maintain a similar layout for all its updated versions. And that's what we notice graphically even for this slot dedicated to Oktoberfest. This means that you will be faced with a striking girl named Heidi and the friendly drinker Hans. With them come the beer mugs, musical instruments, typical Bavarian hats, and playing card icons. There are no major aesthetic changes, but certainly, the visual quality that WMS applies to its games is always one of the most original. The structure is interesting because we don't have a classic game zone, but the grid is a 6x6 with 50 paylines and the possibility of winning up to 1,388 times the bet. But even more curious is the possibility of triggering one of its Jackpot Mega Drops, unlocking Minor, Major, or Epic, which obviously have different growth and limit.\n\nYour betting range is between 0.18 and 180 coins and generally, the winnings obtained are of medium size, of course, if you are in the base game. While they increase when you activate its extra features. Among these, we mention Beer Wild with the possibility that the reels become filled with beer, although in our gaming experience, it is quite rare. At that point, three versions of the Scatter Heidi will appear, which can award free spins or jackpots and dizzying wins.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Bier Haus Oktoberfest slot\n\nThe issue of the Mega Drop prize pools that can be triggered at a certain amount is very appealing, but above all, it is the Wild that will help you conquer some good winnings. First of all, because it is very valid compared to the theme portrayed, and then because it has a very effective power.\n\nBier Haus Oktoberfest is an interesting slot that knows how to entertain and reward the most patient and lucky players. It is not one of the most innovative online machines, but it has everything it takes to make a gambler happy. This quality, however, is related to the excellent work always carried out by WMS, which has accustomed us to some of the best gaming solutions for online slots.\n            ",

And let's not forget its RTP fixed at 96.18%.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nThe entire Bier Haus series has deliberately decided to maintain a similar layout for all its updated versions. And that's what we notice graphically even for this slot dedicated to Oktoberfest. This means that you will be faced with a striking girl named Heidi and the friendly drinker Hans.

At that point, three versions of the Scatter Heidi will appear, which can award free spins or jackpots and dizzying wins.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Bier Haus Oktoberfest slot\n\nThe issue of the Mega Drop prize pools that can be triggered at a certain amount is very appealing, but above all, it is the Wild that will help you conquer some good winnings. First of all, because it is very valid compared to the theme portrayed, and then because it has a very effective power.\n\nBier Haus Oktoberfest is an interesting slot that knows how to entertain and reward the most patient and lucky players. It is not one of the most innovative online machines, but it has everything it takes to make a gambler happy.

Bier Haus Oktoberfest is a delightful gem for the digital gaming industry, created by WMS, who has signed a series of machines with this concept. A sort of saga that you can try for the first time if you haven't already tried your luck. The gamer has the opportunity to celebrate the famous event that revolves around the love for beer. And even though the event usually takes place between September and October, this year you can participate whenever you want and have fun challenging your luck, even in the middle of summer. You'll be struck by the game's structure, but also by the functions that the provider has thought of to offer gamers. And let's not forget its RTP fixed at 96.18%.\n\nGraphics and Game Symbols\n\nThe entire Bier Haus series has deliberately decided to maintain a similar layout for all its updated versions. And that's what we notice graphically even for this slot dedicated to Oktoberfest. This means that you will be faced with a striking girl named Heidi and the friendly drinker Hans. With them come the beer mugs, musical instruments, typical Bavarian hats, and playing card icons. There are no major aesthetic changes, but certainly, the visual quality that WMS applies to its games is always one of the most original. The structure is interesting because we don't have a classic game zone, but the grid is a 6x6 with 50 paylines and the possibility of winning up to 1,388 times the bet. But even more curious is the possibility of triggering one of its Jackpot Mega Drops, unlocking Minor, Major, or Epic, which obviously have different growth and limit.\n\nYour betting range is between 0.18 and 180 coins and generally, the winnings obtained are of medium size, of course, if you are in the base game. While they increase when you activate its extra features. Among these, we mention Beer Wild with the possibility that the reels become filled with beer, although in our gaming experience, it is quite rare. At that point, three versions of the Scatter Heidi will appear, which can award free spins or jackpots and dizzying wins.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Bier Haus Oktoberfest slot\n\nThe issue of the Mega Drop prize pools that can be triggered at a certain amount is very appealing, but above all, it is the Wild that will help you conquer some good winnings. First of all, because it is very valid compared to the theme portrayed, and then because it has a very effective power.\n\nBier Haus Oktoberfest is an interesting slot that knows how to entertain and reward the most patient and lucky players. It is not one of the most innovative online machines, but it has everything it takes to make a gambler happy. This quality, however, is related to the excellent work always carried out by WMS, which has accustomed us to some of the best gaming solutions for online slots.\n        ",
