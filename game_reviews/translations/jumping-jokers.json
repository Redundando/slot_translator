Discover more in the following paragraphs!\n\nSetting and symbols of Jumping Jokers\nThe layout of this Novomatic provider slot is quite spartan: you'll see a collection of fruity symbols spinning around simple purple reels. The gameplay consists of 5 reels and 5 fixed paylines. Playable from 40 cents to 100 euros per spin on desktop, mobile and tablet devices, this classic fruit machine is a simple game. Visually, Jumping Jokers is set on a purple background with navy blue reels. At the bottom of the paytable are the following icons:\n\ngrape, lemon, and orange icons - Get 3, 4 or 5 of these and you'll win a prize of 0.5, 1 or 5 times your bet;\nplum and grape icons. They offer payouts of 1, 2 or 10 times the bet;\nbell icon offers payouts of 2, 5 or 20x\nmelon icon offers payouts of 3, 8 or 30 times the bet\nThe best of the standard symbols is the Golden Star, which offers payouts of 10, 50 or 100 times the bet if you get 3, 4 or 5 in combination.\n\nWhat are the special symbols of this slot without registration?\n\nThe Jumping Joker is the wild symbol and can land on all 5 reels. When it does, it expands to fill the entire wild reel. Even better if the Joker lands on multiple reels, as they will all become wild!\n\nThe Golden Crown is the Mystery Scatter - land 3 or more crowns and you'll win a special prize from the following ranges:\n\n\n3 scatters pay between 2 and 100 times the bet\n4 scatters pay between 10 and 500 times the bet\n5 scatters pay between 100 and 1,000 times the total bet.\n\nHow does the Wild symbol behave in The Jumping Joker?\nWhen it appears on a reel, the wild will expand and take over the entire reel. It will also replace all symbols except the Mystery Scatter. This is represented by the Crown: when 3 or more appear on the reels, you will benefit from a mysterious win.\n\nWhat is the Mystery Win?\nThe size of the Mystery Win depends on how many Mystery Scatters you get:\n\n\n3 will give you between 2 and 100 times the bet\n4 will reward you between 10 and 500 times the bet.\n5 will give you between 100 and 1,000 times the total bet!\n\nFinal impressions on The Jumping Joker\nThe most interesting part of this free slot in our ADM casino library is definitely represented by the Mystery Scatters. I had my biggest wins from the expanding wilds when I got 4 reels completely wild; this brought me a win of about 400 times my bet. Another positive aspect of this game is its medium-high variance, ideal for a smooth and uncomplicated game.
