Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\nMaximus Payus is a 5-reel, 3-line slot with 1,024 ways to win and high volatility. The game takes place in ancient Rome, and the graphics resemble those of cartoons. Each spin is accompanied by the sound of trumpets and the mechanical noise of the reels. The purple game grid is transparent and reveals the backdrop of the Colosseum's colonnade, while the lower part shows the bet information and the buttons to start the game and access the menu.\n\nSymbols and Paytable\n\nThe symbols that pay less in Maximus Payus are those related to playing cards (9, 10, J, Q, K, and A). Thematic symbols include the helmet and shield with crossed swords, the chariot, the Colosseum and the centurion, which pays the most. The laurel wreath with the word Wild is the Wild symbol and the Scatter is represented by the imperial eagle and the Bonus wording. The Bonus symbol can appear during free spins, and 3, 4 or 5 symbols award 8, 15, and 20 free spins, respectively. By activating the Bet Fortune option, the Bonus symbol will increase in size, significantly increasing your chances of winning. During free spins, a x2 multiplier may appear on the reels, and if Wild symbols land, they will be multiplied together, resulting in a multiplier of x8.\n\nBetting Options\n\nThe minimum bet for each spin in Maximus Payus is 0.20 €, and the maximum is 60 €, which makes the game accessible to all players. The game offers a left-handed slider that moves the Start and Settings buttons to the right, and a Turbo button that speeds up the rotation of the reels.\n\nBonuses and Features\n\nMaximus Payus offers both free spins and random bonuses. Three Bonus symbols pay 8 free spins, 4 pay 15, and 5 special symbols give you 20 free spins. Bonus symbols can appear during free spins, and 2, 3, 4 or 5 symbols award 5, 8, 15, and 20 free spins, respectively. During regular play, two different types of entirely random bonuses can activate, the first entitles you to a level win or one equal to 20x, and the second awards 5 or more identical symbols.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nMaximus Payus has an RTP (return to player) of 95% and high volatility. This means that while you may not win as often as with a low volatility game, when you do win, you can expect the payouts to be higher.\n\n        \n            ",

This slot is dedicated to the valiant centurions, with graphics that resemble those of cartoons. The purple game grid is transparent and reveals the backdrop of the Colosseum's colonnade.

It was during these centuries that the Roman army's war techniques allowed them to defeat numerous enemies and reach every known land at the time. This slot is dedicated to the valiant centurions, with graphics that resemble those of cartoons. The purple game grid is transparent and reveals the backdrop of the Colosseum's colonnade. Information on the bet is displayed in the lower part, and on the left, there are buttons for starting the game and accessing the menu. On the left, we also have the icon for modifying our bet and the slider through which we can activate the \"Fortune Bet\" option. Each spin is accompanied by the sound of trumpets and the mechanical noise of the reels. \n\nKey features of the slot machine\nThe grid consists of 5 reels and 3 lines and there are a whopping 1,024 ways to win. The minimum bet for each spin is 0.20 €, the maximum is 60 €, a betting range that suits every pocket. From the settings, you can activate a left-handed slider, which will move the Start and Settings buttons to the right. There is also a Turbo button that speeds up the rotation of the reels. Maximus Payus has an RTP (return to player) of 95% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and Features of Maximus Payus\nIn order of value, the symbols that pay less are those related to playing cards, 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A. Next, we find the thematic symbols: the helmet and shield with crossed swords have the same value, then we have the chariot and the Colosseum. However, the centurion pays the most. The laurel wreath with the word Wild is our Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the imperial eagle and the Bonus wording. 3 Bonus symbols pay 8 Free Spins, 4 pay 15, and 5 special symbols give you 20 free spins. In addition, by activating the Bet Fortune option, the Bonus symbol will increase in size, significantly increasing your chances of winning. During free spins, a x2 multiplier may appear on the reels and if Wild symbols land, they will be multiplied together, resulting in a multiplier of x8. If Bonus symbols appear during free spins, additional spins are granted:\n\n2 Bonus symbols award 5 Free Spins.\n3 Bonus symbols award 8 Free Spins.\n4 Bonus symbols award 15 Free Spins.\n5 Bonus symbols award 20 Free Spins.\n\nDuring regular play, there are also two different types of entirely random bonuses. The first entitles you to a level win or one equal to 20x, and the second awards 5 or more identical symbols.\n        ",
