The paylines are indicated on either side of the grid, and at the bottom, players can find the Start button, the Autoplay feature, the bet adjuster, the button to make the maximum bet, the amount of instant and total winnings, and icons to turn off the music, access the internal menu and return to the initial screen. The musical component is pleasant, with a motif of electronic sounds and flutes and some special effects on occasion of wins.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nFetching Fruits has nine symbols, divided into low-level ones that pay less and high-level ones that offer significant rewards. The low-level symbols include cherries, lemons, and the numbers 9 and 10. The high-level symbols include plum, watermelon, orange, and bell. Winning combinations develop from the first reel on the left moving to the right. There are five fixed paylines, and players win by combining 3 to 5 identical symbols. The minimum bet is €0.05, and the maximum bet is €10. The more players bet, the more chances they have of winning, with increasing winnings as the initial bet increases.\n\nBetting Options\n\nIn Fetching Fruits, players can choose their bet amount from €0.05, €0.10, €0.20, €0.50, €1, €2.50, €5, and €10. The minimum bet is €0.05, and the maximum bet is €10. The higher the bet, the higher the winnings, with a chance of hitting dizzying sums. Winning combinations develop from the first reel on the left moving to the right.\n\nAutoplay Feature\n\nFetching Fruits offers an Autoplay feature that allows players to select between 10 and 100 automatic spins, with win or loss limits that, when reached, return the game to manual mode. This feature is useful for those who prefer a more hands-off approach to playing slots.\n\nMenu and Information\n\nFetching Fruits has a bare internal menu that may not be very useful for all players. It lacks information on volatility and RTP. However, the symbols and paylines are clearly visible and straightforward, making it easy for players to understand the game. Clickable icons on the screen allow players to turn off the music, access the internal menu, and return to the initial screen.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics\n\nThe gameplay mechanics of Fetching Fruits are smooth and uninterrupted, with easy-to-follow symbols and paylines. The 5x3 game grid is a classic design with 5 fixed paylines, and winning combinations develop from the first reel on the left to the right.\n\nSymbol values and paylines\n\nFetching Fruits has nine symbols, with low-level symbols paying less and high-level symbols offering significant rewards. The minimum bet is €0.05, and players win by combining 3 to 5 identical symbols. Cherries and lemons have the lowest payouts, while the bell symbol has the highest value, reaching up to €50. \n\nBetting options\n\nPlayers can choose between a range of betting options, from €0,05 up to €10. The more you bet, the more chances you have of winning. The maximum bet option is available for players who want to increase their winnings quickly.\n\nAutoplay feature\n\nFetching Fruits offers an autoplay feature that allows players to select between 10 and 100 automatic spins, with a win or loss limit. Players can set these limits and then relax as the game automatically plays for them.\n\nLack of important references in internal menu\n\nOne downside to Fetching Fruits is the lack of important references in the internal menu. While the game provides players with the necessary information in terms of betting options and payouts, there is no mention of volatility or RTP. Additionally, the internal menu is bare and lacks useful features that many other slots offer.\n\n        \n            ",

The reason lies in the great appeal that this type of game holds. NewAge Games has respected the three main rules that we can find in Fruit Machines: simplicity, non-too-sophisticated graphics, easily recognizable symbols.\nBefore delving into the gameplay mechanics, let's take a look at how Fetching Fruits presents itself.\nThe black screen background gives way to the purple color of the reels, with symbols of essential lines and opaque color.\nThe paylines are indicated on either side of the grid, while at the bottom, proceeding from left to right, we find the Start button, the Autoplay, the bet adjuster, the button to make the maximum bet, the amount of instant and total winnings. Then there are the icons to turn off the music, the one to access the internal menu, and finally the one that allows us to return to the initial screen.\nThe musical component is also quite pleasant, with a motif of electronic sounds and flutes and some special effects on occasion of wins.\nSlot features\nThe game grid is a classic 5×3, with 5 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is €0,05, but you can choose amounts of €0,10, €0,20, €0,50, €1, €2,50, €5, and finally €10. The more you bet, the more chances you have of winning. As in almost all slots, winning combinations develop from the first reel on the left moving to the right.\nAutoplay offers the possibility of selecting between 10 and 100 automatic spins, with win or loss limits beyond which the game will return to manual mode.\nSymbols and functionality\nIn Fetching Fruits, we have nine symbols, divided between low-level ones, paying less, and high-level ones that instead offer significant rewards. You win by combining 3 to 5 identical symbols.\nFor our tests, we set the minimum bet to €0.05. Cherries and lemons are the symbols that pay the least, from a minimum of €0.10 (three symbols) to a maximum of €1.50 (5 symbols).\nNext, we find the numbers 9 and 10, which offer winnings from €0.10 up to €1.50.\nWith the plum and watermelon, we step up a level, with sums ranging from €0.15 up to €2.\nThe orange pays up to a maximum of €5, while the bell is the symbol with the highest value, reaching €50.\nNaturally, increasing the initial bet, the winnings increase, with dizzying sums.\nPros and cons of Fetching Fruits\nWe liked this slot, starting from the smooth gameplay mechanics that allow the reels to spin without annoying interruptions.\nThe simple symbols and clearly visible paylines seemed adequate to us, while we expected something more from the internal menu, which is bare and without important references such as volatility and RTP.\n        ",
