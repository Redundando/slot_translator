This slot game follows tradition, evident in the size of the grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, as classic as it can be. However, if we decide to activate all the lines, the grid will become 5x4 instead. Paylines are selectable both during game presentation and between spins by choosing an option on the left side of the grid. We can activate 5, 20, 40, or 100 paylines. It goes without saying that the more lines we activate, the greater chances of obtaining winning combinations at a higher cost per spin. In \"All Lucky Clovers,\" the RTP value is 97%. The symbols in this game are colorful fruits such as cherries, lemon, orange, grapes, prunes, and watermelon. The highest payout symbol is the golden-crowned heart. The clover jewel is the Wild symbol, which replaces all symbols except for other bonuses, and is an expanding one that fills the reel when it appears. The horseshoe and diamond are our Scatters that pay regardless of their position on the grid. Additionally, \"All Lucky Clovers\" also offers a Gamble function that allows us to double the amount won by guessing the color of the card that the banker will turn over.\n        ",

So, if you're feeling lucky and want to stare at some simple graphics, give 'All Lucky Clover' a spin.</p><p>The game grid itself is surrounded by a gilded border, making it feel like you're playing something fancy, like a game for royalty. But, shhh, don't tell anyone it's just a slot game. The symbols, although more prominent than in a typical slot game, are still easy to see, which is good as you'll want to keep track of them in case they result in a win!</p><p>'All Lucky Clover' has a minimalist console, with only a few buttons: Start, Autoplay, and Bet Variator. But don't let their simplicity fool you: behind each button lies both the opportunity for riches and the chance of losing everything. So, choose wisely! If you need some help setting up your gameplay or getting to know this fantastic slot game better, all the info you need is available in the handy menu.</p>\"\n}"

Fruits are generally low-value symbols except for watermelon, which has a higher yield. The golden-crowned heart symbol offers the highest payout value in the game. The Wild symbol is the clover jewel, and the expanding Wild fills the reel when it appears.

It is also an expanding Wild. The horseshoe and diamond symbols act as Scatters and pay regardless of their position on the grid.\n\nRTP Value\n\nAll Lucky Clover has an RTP value of 97%, which is highly favorable for players.\n\nGamble Function\n\nAll Lucky Clover offers a Gamble function that allows players to double their winnings by correctly guessing the color of the card that the banker will turn over.\n\n        \n            ",

It pays tribute to the tradition of Fruit Machines where fruits are the central focus. The game grid has a golden border and a black background, with well-defined, larger symbols. The console has few buttons, with the main ones being Start, Autoplay, and Bet Variator. All settings to set up the best gameplay are available in the menu.\n\nPaylines\n\nThe paylines in 'All Lucky Clover' are selectable both during game presentation and between spins, and we can activate 5, 20, 40, or 100 paylines. The more lines activated, the greater the chances of obtaining winning combinations at a higher cost per spin. The minimum bets vary based on the number of selected paylines: 5 lines (€0.10), 20 lines (€0.20), 40 lines (€0.40), and 100 lines (€0.50).\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols in 'All Lucky Clover' include colorful fruits such as cherries, lemon, orange, grapes, prunes, and watermelon. These are the lowest value symbols, while the watermelon has an excellent yield with a value of 7, an equally high-level symbol. The highest payout symbol is the golden-crowned heart. The clover jewel is the Wild symbol, which replaces all symbols except for other bonuses, and is an expanding one that fills the reel when it appears. The horseshoe and diamond are the Scatters that pay regardless of their position on the grid.\n\nBonus Features\n\n'All Lucky Clover' offers several bonus features to enhance the gameplay experience. The Wild symbol is the clover jewel, which is an expanding symbol that fills the reel when it appears. The horseshoe and diamond are the Scatters that pay regardless of their position on the grid. The game also includes an auto-play feature, one for speeding up the reel's rotation, and a Gamble function that allows us to double the amount won by guessing the color of the card that the banker will turn over.\n\nGamble Function\n\nThe Gamble function in 'All Lucky Clover' allows us to double the amount won by guessing the color of the card that the banker will turn over.\n\n        \n            ",

This product pays tribute to the tradition of Fruit Machines where fruits are the central focus. To add a touch of color and remind us that we rely on luck, the background is a long stretch of clovers. The game grid has a golden border and a black background, with well-defined and larger symbols. There isn't a particular tune for this slot but an arcade electronic music and the mechanical noise of the reels accompany our spins.\n\nAs with all BGaming games, the console has few buttons except for the main ones: Start, Autoplay, and Bet Variator. Nonetheless, all settings to set up the best gameplay are available in the menu.\n\nSlot Features\nThis slot follows tradition, evident in the size of the grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, as classic as it can be. However, if we decide to activate all the lines, the grid will become 5x4 instead. Paylines are selectable both during game presentation and between spins by choosing an option on the left side of the grid. We can activate 5, 20, 40, or 100 paylines. It goes without saying that the more lines we activate, the greater chances of obtaining winning combinations at a higher cost per spin. Let's see how the minimum bets vary:\n\n- 5 lines: €0.10\n- 20 lines: €0.20\n- 40 lines: €0.40\n- 100 lines: €0.50\n\nAmongst many available options, there is an auto-play feature and one for speeding up the reel's rotation. In \"All Lucky Clovers,\" the RTP value is 97%.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\nIn this slot, we find many colorful fruits such as cherries, lemon, orange, grapes, prunes, and watermelon. These are the lowest value symbols except for watermelon, which has an excellent yield, with a value of 7, an equally high-level symbol. The highest payout symbol is the golden-crowned heart. The clover jewel is the Wild symbol, which replaces all symbols except for other bonuses, and is an expanding one that fills the reel when it appears. The horseshoe and diamond are our Scatters that pay regardless of their position on the grid.\n\n\"All Lucky Clovers\" also offers a Gamble function that allows us to double the amount won by guessing the color of the card that the banker will turn over.\n        ",
