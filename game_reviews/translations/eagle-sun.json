Con Eagle Sun, la Lightning Box Games ci trasporta proprio in questo mondo, grazie ad una slot machine immersiva e particolare. Come in ogni recensione andiamo ad analizzare prima l’aspetto grafico e sonoro, che stavolta è davvero pazzesco.\nSotto il sole cocente di Eagle Sun\nGrazie al lavoro fatto da Lightning Box Games, il comparto artistico di Eagle Sun ci mette davvero poco a catapultarci nel deserto dell’Arizona. L’immensa pianura del deserto, delimitata solo da qualche montagna sullo sfondo, è abitata dai nativi americani, che hanno piantato alcune delle loro tende caratteristiche, mentre svariate aquile volano nel cielo. La griglia di gioco è composta da 5 rulli di legno senza cornice, separati tra di loro da un piccolo spazio. Gli abitanti del deserto sullo sfondo invece, li ritroviamo tra i simboli. Un capo tribù con la nuca ricoperta di piume, uno sciamano donna e un guerriero armato di lancia sono i simboli speciali, mentre tra quelli normali troviamo i classici Q, A, J, 10, alcuni tamburi e un acchiappasogni. Il simbolo Wild è il deserto, accompagnato dall’animazione di un’aquila che vola, mentre lo Scatter è un totem, che ritroveremo anche (in versione più grande) ai lati della griglia in una particolare modalità di gioco di cui parleremo più avanti. L’ultimo simbolo è quello della Eagle Spin, caratterizzato dalla testa di un’aquila che, attivata l’animazione, volerà versò il giocatore. Oltre alla grafica, c’è un altro aspetto artistico che eccelle in Eagle Sun, ovvero la musica, caratterizzata da sonorità che tipicamente attribuiamo al clima del deserto del vecchio west, e che sembra trasportarci in un inseguimento tra carovane. A prima vista potrebbe sembrare troppo movimentata, ma ci vorrà ben poco per accorgersi che si sposa perfettamente con il gameplay rapido e ricco di azione di questa slot machine.\nColpi di scena inaspettati con Eagle Sun\nEagle Sun dispone di parecchie spin particolari, sbloccabili in più modi. Quando si ottiene il già citato simbolo della Eagle Spin, partiranno delle spin in cui sarà possibile ottenere solo caselle vuote o Wild, e tutto questo andrà avanti finché si otterranno delle aquile. Ci sono altri modi per ottenere spin gratuite, come ottenendo 3, 4 o 5 scatter, ai quali seguiranno rispettivamente 7, 12 o 16 spin gratuite, che si concluderanno con una Super Eagle Spin, dove la griglia si amplierà fino a raggiungere 80 caselle. Con un RTP di 95.76% Eagle Sun si posiziona perfettamente nella media.\nAltre slot consigliate\nSe avete ancora voglia di esplorare il deserto e il vecchio west, alcune slot machines che potrebbero fare per voi sono Dead Or Alive II, Wild West Gold e Cowboy Treasure Deluxe.\n",

The allure of the desert never runs dry, especially when it serves as a setting for thrilling showdowns between cowboys and outlaws. However, the most fascinating and mystical aspect of the Old West is the Native Americans, whose intimate relationship with nature made them masters of the desert. With Eagle Sun, Lightning Box Games takes us into this world through an immersive and unique slot machine. As experienced gamblers, we will first analyze the visual and auditory aspect, which is truly mind-blowing.\n\nUnder the scorching sun of Eagle Sun\n\nThanks to the work done by Lightning Box Games, the artistic aspect of Eagle Sun immerses us in the Arizona desert in no time. The vast expanse of the desert, with only a few mountains in the background, is inhabited by Native Americans, who have set up some of their characteristic tents while numerous eagles fly in the sky. The game grid consists of 5 unframed wooden reels separated by a small space. We find the inhabitants of the desert in the background among the symbols. A tribal chief with a head full of feathers, a female shaman, and a warrior armed with a spear are the special symbols, while among the normal ones, we find the classic Q, A, J, 10, some drums, and a dreamcatcher. The Wild symbol is the desert, accompanied by an animation of an eagle flying, while the Scatter is a totem, which we will also find (in a larger version) on the sides of the grid in a special game mode that we will discuss later. The last symbol is the Eagle Spin, characterized by the head of an eagle that, when animated, will fly towards the player. Besides the graphics, there is another artistic aspect where Eagle Sun excels, namely the music, featuring sounds that we typically attribute to the climate of the Old West desert, and that seem to transport us into a caravan chase. At first glance, it may seem too lively, but it won't take long to realize that it perfectly complements the fast-paced and action-packed gameplay of this slot machine.\n\nUnexpected twists with Eagle Sun\n\nEagle Sun offers several special spins that can be unlocked in various ways. When you get the aforementioned Eagle Spin symbol, spins will start where you can only get empty boxes or Wilds, and all this will continue until you get the eagles. There are other ways to get free spins, such as by getting 3, 4, or 5 Scatters, followed respectively by 7, 12, or 16 free spins, ending with a Super Eagle Spin, where the grid will expand to reach 80 boxes.

The allure of the desert is never exhausted, particularly when it provides the backdrop to exciting shootouts between cowboys and bandits. However, the most fascinating and mystical aspect of the old west are the Native Americans, with their lives in close contact with nature that made them masters of the desert. With Eagle Sun, Lightning Box Games transports us to this world, thanks to an immersive and particular slot machine. As in any review, let's first analyze the graphical and sound aspect, which this time is truly mind-blowing.\n\nUnder the scorching sun of Eagle Sun\nThanks to Lightning Box Games' efforts, Eagle Sun's artistic production takes us to the Arizona desert in no time. The immense plain of the desert, delimited only by some mountains in the background, is inhabited by Native Americans who have set up some of their characteristic tents, while various eagles fly in the sky. The game grid consists of 5 unframed wooden reels, separated from each other by a small space. On the other hand, we find the inhabitants of the desert in the background among the symbols. A tribe leader with the back of his head covered in feathers, a female shaman, and a spear-wielding warrior are the special symbols, while among the regular ones, we find classics like Q, A, J, 10, some drums, and a dreamcatcher. The desert is the Wild symbol, accompanied by the animation of a flying eagle, while the Scatter is a totem that we will also find (in a larger version) on the sides of the grid in a particular game mode that we will discuss later. The last symbol is that of the Eagle Spin, characterized by the head of an eagle that, once activated, will fly towards the player. In addition to the graphics, there is another artistic aspect that excels in Eagle Sun, namely the music, characterized by sounds typically attributed to the climate of the old west desert, and that seems to transport us into a caravan chase. At first glance, it may seem too lively, but it won't take long to realize that it perfectly matches the fast-paced, action-packed gameplay of this slot machine.\n\nUnexpected twists with Eagle Sun\nEagle Sun has several special spins, which can be unlocked in several ways. When you get the aforementioned Eagle Spin symbol, spins will start in which you can only get empty spaces or Wilds. All of this will continue until you get some eagles. There are other ways to get free spins, such as getting 3, 4, or 5 Scatters, which will respectively follow with 7, 12, or 16 free spins, which will end with a Super Eagle Spin where the grid will expand up to reach 80 boxes. With an RTP of 95.76%, Eagle Sun is perfectly positioned within the average.\n\nOther recommended slots\nIf you still feel like exploring the desert and the old west, some slot machines that might be right for you are Dead or Alive II, Wild West Gold, and Cowboy Treasure Deluxe.\n            ",

With its impressive artistic production, the game offers an immersive experience of the inhospitable but fascinating landscape of the old west.\n\nGame grid and symbols\n\nThe game grid of Eagle Sun consists of 5 wooden reels without frames, with background mountains in the distance. The special symbols of the game are a tribe leader, a female shaman, and a spear-wielding warrior. The regular symbols include Q, A, J, 10, some drums, and a dreamcatcher. The Wild symbol is a desert scene with an animation of a flying eagle, while the Scatter is a totem. Another symbol is the Eagle Spin, with an eagle's head that is activated to fly at the player.\n\nSpecial features and game modes\n\nEagle Sun has several special spins, which can be unlocked in several ways. When the Eagle Spin symbol appears, the spins start and you can only obtain empty spaces or Wilds. The spin continues until a few eagles appear. If 3, 4 or 5 Scatters appear on the grid, 7, 12, or 16 free spins are rewarded, respectively, followed by a Super Eagle Spin. In this mode, the grid expands up to 80 boxes. \n\nRTP\n\nWith an RTP of 95.76%, Eagle Sun is positioned right within the average.\n\nRecommendation\n\nEagle Sun is a slot game that immerses players in an artistic production of the old west in a really memorable way. The game's atmosphere, with its background music and sound effects, is perfect. With a decent RTP, Eagle Sun may exchange big payouts with smaller, more frequent ones. If you're interested in the old west theme, some games that might pique your interest are Dead or Alive II, Wild West Gold, or Cowboy Treasure Deluxe. \n\n        \n            ",

The allure of the desert is never exhausted, particularly when it provides the backdrop to exciting shootouts between cowboys and bandits. However, the most fascinating and mystical aspect of the old west are the Native Americans, with their lives in close contact with nature that made them masters of the desert. With Eagle Sun, Lightning Box Games transports us to this world, thanks to an immersive and particular slot machine. As in any review, let's first analyze the graphical and sound aspect, which this time is truly mind-blowing.\n\nUnder the scorching sun of Eagle Sun\nThanks to Lightning Box Games' efforts, Eagle Sun's artistic production takes us to the Arizona desert in no time. The immense plain of the desert, delimited only by some mountains in the background, is inhabited by Native Americans who have set up some of their characteristic tents, while various eagles fly in the sky. The game grid consists of 5 unframed wooden reels, separated from each other by a small space. On the other hand, we find the inhabitants of the desert in the background among the symbols. A tribe leader with the back of his head covered in feathers, a female shaman, and a spear-wielding warrior are the special symbols, while among the regular ones, we find classics like Q, A, J, 10, some drums, and a dreamcatcher. The desert is the Wild symbol, accompanied by the animation of a flying eagle, while the Scatter is a totem that we will also find (in a larger version) on the sides of the grid in a particular game mode that we will discuss later. The last symbol is that of the Eagle Spin, characterized by the head of an eagle that, once activated, will fly towards the player. In addition to the graphics, there is another artistic aspect that excels in Eagle Sun, namely the music, characterized by sounds typically attributed to the climate of the old west desert, and that seems to transport us into a caravan chase. At first glance, it may seem too lively, but it won't take long to realize that it perfectly matches the fast-paced, action-packed gameplay of this slot machine.\n\nUnexpected twists with Eagle Sun\nEagle Sun has several special spins, which can be unlocked in several ways. When you get the aforementioned Eagle Spin symbol, spins will start in which you can only get empty spaces or Wilds. All of this will continue until you get some eagles. There are other ways to get free spins, such as getting 3, 4, or 5 Scatters, which will respectively follow with 7, 12, or 16 free spins, which will end with a Super Eagle Spin where the grid will expand up to reach 80 boxes. With an RTP of 95.76%, Eagle Sun is perfectly positioned within the average.\n\nOther recommended slots\nIf you still feel like exploring the desert and the old west, some slot machines that might be right for you are Dead or Alive II, Wild West Gold, and Cowboy Treasure Deluxe.\n            ",

As in any review, let's first analyze the graphical and sound aspect, which this time is truly mind-blowing.\n\nUnder the scorching sun of Eagle Sun\nThanks to Lightning Box Games' efforts, Eagle Sun's artistic production takes us to the Arizona desert in no time. The immense plain of the desert, delimited only by some mountains in the background, is inhabited by Native Americans who have set up some of their characteristic tents, while various eagles fly in the sky. The game grid consists of 5 unframed wooden reels, separated from each other by a small space. On the other hand, we find the inhabitants of the desert in the background among the symbols. A tribe leader with the back of his head covered in feathers, a female shaman, and a spear-wielding warrior are the special symbols, while among the regular ones, we find classics like Q, A, J, 10, some drums, and a dreamcatcher. The desert is the Wild symbol, accompanied by the animation of a flying eagle, while the Scatter is a totem that we will also find (in a larger version) on the sides of the grid in a particular game mode that we will discuss later. The last symbol is that of the Eagle Spin, characterized by the head of an eagle that, once activated, will fly towards the player. In addition to the graphics, there is another artistic aspect that excels in Eagle Sun, namely the music, characterized by sounds typically attributed to the climate of the old west desert, and that seems to transport us into a caravan chase. At first glance, it may seem too lively, but it won't take long to realize that it perfectly matches the fast-paced, action-packed gameplay of this slot machine.\n\nUnexpected twists with Eagle Sun\nEagle Sun has several special spins, which can be unlocked in several ways. When you get the aforementioned Eagle Spin symbol, spins will start in which you can only get empty spaces or Wilds. All of this will continue until you get some eagles. There are other ways to get free spins, such as getting 3, 4, or 5 Scatters, which will respectively follow with 7, 12, or 16 free spins, which will end with a Super Eagle Spin where the grid will expand up to reach 80 boxes. With an RTP of 95.76%, Eagle Sun is perfectly positioned within the average.\n\nOther recommended slots\nIf you still feel like exploring the desert and the old west, some slot machines that might be right for you are Dead or Alive II, Wild West Gold, and Cowboy Treasure Deluxe.\n            ",
