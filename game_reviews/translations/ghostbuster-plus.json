Let's start our review by talking about the aesthetic aspect of this Ghostbusters Plus and if there has been any real change compared to the previous slots.\n\nGhostbusters Plus - Winning graphics never change\nThe graphics of Ghostbusters Plus don't differ much from the other three IGT titles. We find ourselves once again in front of the Ghostbusters headquarters as the background to the game grid, although this time there have been improvements in graphics and attention to detail, as even the ECTO-1 car can be noticed.\nAs far as symbols are concerned, once again we find the faces of the four protagonists. This time, not just simple promotional illustrations or cutouts directly from the film, but portraits with strong graphics and differentiated by color.\nIn addition to the faces of Ray, Peter, Egon and Winston, we will also find other references to the film such as the Ghostbusters logo, the pesky ectoplasm Slimer and the fierce guardian Zuul. Compared to previous slots, in Ghostbusters Plus, the film's objects are not present and in their place, classic playing card symbols have been introduced.\nIn fact, we will see the initials A, K, Q and J gliding along the game grid in a very minimal font and the same colors as the portraits of the four ghostbusters.\nIn short, Ghostbusters Plus does not completely deviate from the two slots that came before it, and does not bring any particular graphic changes. Therefore, it remains a slot for fans of the film and for those who have already played Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters Triple Slime, this Ghostbusters Plus is not a big novelty.\n\nGhostbusters Plus - How to play?\nAfter talking about the graphics, let's move on to the more technical aspect: what can we expect from a slot like this? Just like the other IGT twins, in this case, we are faced with a game that uses the mechanism 5*3 to help the player get familiar quickly but at the same time offers bonus features that allow for a fun and varied gameplay.\nThese features are attributed not only thanks to special symbols (such as the demon dog that acts as a bonus guard) but also thanks to random events that can be triggered during the game and the level of Slimer that can increase during the game.\nA slot to be discovered, which manages to combine an appreciated gameplay with new graphics, meticulously crafted in every detail.\n\nSlots similar to Ghostbusters Plus\nAlthough it may seem redundant, once again we remind you of the IGT twins that need to be tried if you want to move in the same direction as this slot. The first is the laconic Ghostbusters and the second is the already mentioned Ghostbusters Triple Slime.\nIn addition, NetEnt, Microgaming, and Playtech offer dozens of cinema-themed slime slots to be discovered, dedicated to cult classics such as Jurassic Park, Top Gun, and Alien.\n            ",

It features familiar characters and symbols from the franchise, presented with improved graphics and attention to detail. The game offers players a 5*3 mechanism, special symbols, and random events that can be triggered during gameplay.\n\nGameplay mechanics and design\n\nIGT's Ghostbusters Plus uses a 5*3 mechanism that is intuitive to players familiar with slot games. Bonus features are offered via special symbols and random events during gameplay. The graphics have improved since the previous iterations of the game, with detailed portraits of the four protagonists and notable attention to detail with the ECTO-1 car and other symbols referencing the Ghostbusters film franchise.\n\nBonus features and special symbols\n\nIn addition to special symbols like the demon dog that acts as a bonus guardian, Ghostbusters Plus offers random events that can occur during gameplay, as well as a level of Slimer that can increase over time. Combined with the 5*3 mechanism, these features make for a fun and varied gameplay experience.\n\nAppeal to fans of the film franchise\n\nFans of the Ghostbusters film franchise will appreciate the attention to detail in the graphics and the familiar characters and symbols present in the game. While there are some improvements to graphics in Ghostbusters Plus, the game does not offer much that is significantly different from the previous iterations, making it a good choice for existing fans of the franchise.\n\nCompetition from other cinema-themed slot games\n\nIGT's Ghostbusters Plus is just one of several cinema-themed slots available to players. Others, including games from NetEnt, Microgaming, and Playtech, offer similar gameplay and graphics tied to classic films like Jurassic Park, Top Gun, and Alien. Players looking to explore the genre may find other options in addition to Ghostbusters Plus.\n\n        \n            ",

Let's start our review by talking about the aesthetic aspect of this Ghostbusters Plus and if there has been any real change compared to the previous slots.\n\nGhostbusters Plus - Winning graphics never change\nThe graphics of Ghostbusters Plus don't differ much from the other three IGT titles. We find ourselves once again in front of the Ghostbusters headquarters as the background to the game grid, although this time there have been improvements in graphics and attention to detail, as even the ECTO-1 car can be noticed.\nAs far as symbols are concerned, once again we find the faces of the four protagonists. This time, not just simple promotional illustrations or cutouts directly from the film, but portraits with strong graphics and differentiated by color.\nIn addition to the faces of Ray, Peter, Egon and Winston, we will also find other references to the film such as the Ghostbusters logo, the pesky ectoplasm Slimer and the fierce guardian Zuul. Compared to previous slots, in Ghostbusters Plus, the film's objects are not present and in their place, classic playing card symbols have been introduced.\nIn fact, we will see the initials A, K, Q and J gliding along the game grid in a very minimal font and the same colors as the portraits of the four ghostbusters.\nIn short, Ghostbusters Plus does not completely deviate from the two slots that came before it, and does not bring any particular graphic changes. Therefore, it remains a slot for fans of the film and for those who have already played Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters Triple Slime, this Ghostbusters Plus is not a big novelty.\n\nGhostbusters Plus - How to play?\nAfter talking about the graphics, let's move on to the more technical aspect: what can we expect from a slot like this? Just like the other IGT twins, in this case, we are faced with a game that uses the mechanism 5*3 to help the player get familiar quickly but at the same time offers bonus features that allow for a fun and varied gameplay.\nThese features are attributed not only thanks to special symbols (such as the demon dog that acts as a bonus guard) but also thanks to random events that can be triggered during the game and the level of Slimer that can increase during the game.\nA slot to be discovered, which manages to combine an appreciated gameplay with new graphics, meticulously crafted in every detail.\n\nSlots similar to Ghostbusters Plus\nAlthough it may seem redundant, once again we remind you of the IGT twins that need to be tried if you want to move in the same direction as this slot. The first is the laconic Ghostbusters and the second is the already mentioned Ghostbusters Triple Slime.\nIn addition, NetEnt, Microgaming, and Playtech offer dozens of cinema-themed slime slots to be discovered, dedicated to cult classics such as Jurassic Park, Top Gun, and Alien.\n            ",

Let's start our review by talking about the aesthetic aspect of this Ghostbusters Plus and if there has been any real change compared to the previous slots.\n\nGhostbusters Plus - Winning graphics never change\nThe graphics of Ghostbusters Plus don't differ much from the other three IGT titles. We find ourselves once again in front of the Ghostbusters headquarters as the background to the game grid, although this time there have been improvements in graphics and attention to detail, as even the ECTO-1 car can be noticed.\nAs far as symbols are concerned, once again we find the faces of the four protagonists. This time, not just simple promotional illustrations or cutouts directly from the film, but portraits with strong graphics and differentiated by color.\nIn addition to the faces of Ray, Peter, Egon and Winston, we will also find other references to the film such as the Ghostbusters logo, the pesky ectoplasm Slimer and the fierce guardian Zuul. Compared to previous slots, in Ghostbusters Plus, the film's objects are not present and in their place, classic playing card symbols have been introduced.\nIn fact, we will see the initials A, K, Q and J gliding along the game grid in a very minimal font and the same colors as the portraits of the four ghostbusters.\nIn short, Ghostbusters Plus does not completely deviate from the two slots that came before it, and does not bring any particular graphic changes. Therefore, it remains a slot for fans of the film and for those who have already played Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters Triple Slime, this Ghostbusters Plus is not a big novelty.\n\nGhostbusters Plus - How to play?\nAfter talking about the graphics, let's move on to the more technical aspect: what can we expect from a slot like this? Just like the other IGT twins, in this case, we are faced with a game that uses the mechanism 5*3 to help the player get familiar quickly but at the same time offers bonus features that allow for a fun and varied gameplay.\nThese features are attributed not only thanks to special symbols (such as the demon dog that acts as a bonus guard) but also thanks to random events that can be triggered during the game and the level of Slimer that can increase during the game.\nA slot to be discovered, which manages to combine an appreciated gameplay with new graphics, meticulously crafted in every detail.\n\nSlots similar to Ghostbusters Plus\nAlthough it may seem redundant, once again we remind you of the IGT twins that need to be tried if you want to move in the same direction as this slot. The first is the laconic Ghostbusters and the second is the already mentioned Ghostbusters Triple Slime.\nIn addition, NetEnt, Microgaming, and Playtech offer dozens of cinema-themed slime slots to be discovered, dedicated to cult classics such as Jurassic Park, Top Gun, and Alien.\n        ",
