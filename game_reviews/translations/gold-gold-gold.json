    "original_text": "\nGold Gold Gold\nCon uno stile retrò e un gameplay semplice, Gold Gold Gold di Booming Games regala ore di svago grazie a simboli impilati, Wild, Free Spins e la funzione Gamble\nQual è il tema di Gold Gold Gold?\nFondata nel 2014, in quasi dieci anni di carriera la Booming Games ha lanciato sul mercato numerose slot con cui ha vinto diversi premi, ricevendo un forte apprezzamento dai giocatori di tutto il mondo. Ci riprova ora con Gold Gold Gold, un gioco dallo stile retrò con simboli classici quali campane, stelle e diamanti. Che la semplicità sia la caratteristica principale lo si intuisce a prima vista, con una grafica molto easy e senza fronzoli. Lo sfondo viola contrasta con il colore delle monete dorate che si trovano alla base della schermata principale e con la trama bordeaux della griglia. I simboli sono disegnati in modo elementare, ma le grandi dimensioni vanno a beneficio della giocabilità. I tasti si trovano sulla destra, uno per dare avvio al gioco, uno per le scommesse e uno per accedere alla tabella dei pagamenti.\nUna musica stile dance anni Ottanta ci accompagna durante gli Spin, con qualche effetto sonoro in seguito alle vincite.\nCaratteristiche di Gold Gold Gold\nLa Booming Games ha mantenuto fede alla tradizione anche su altri aspetti, come ad esempio la dimensione della griglia, con 5 rulli e 3 righe. Le linee di pagamento sono variabili e possiamo decidere noi quante attivarne per un massimo di 20. Il costo minimo di una singola partita è di 0,01 € per linea, quindi se ne abbiamo attivato 20, il costo sarà di 0,20 €. Il tasto Max Bet ci consente di impostare la scommessa massima con un unico click. C’è poi il tasto Turbo che accelera la caduta dei simboli, e L’Autoplay, con cui far partire i giri automatici.\nLa volatilità è media, il ritorno teorico al giocatore (RTP) è del 96%.\nCome vincere a Gold Gold Gold\nPer conoscere in maniera dettagliata i pagamenti dei simboli, vi consigliamo di accedere alla tabella payments, mentre qui ci limiteremo a fare una panoramica veloce. Cominciamo dicendo che per vincere bisogna creare combo di 3, 4 o 5 simboli identici da sinistra a destra. A valere meno sono le fiches con i semi delle carte da gioco (cuori, picche, quadri e fiori), a seguire troviamo i lingotti d’oro, la stella e la campana. Il Wild ripaga più di tutti i simboli regolari e ricopre la funzione di Jolly, sostituendo ogni simbolo tranne lo Scatter. I simboli possono atterrare impilati, con quindi maggiori possibilità di ottenere una serie di icone vincenti. La scritta Gold Gold Gold è lo Scatter ed è anch’esso pagante, anzi è il simbolo che paga di più in assoluto. Da 3 a 5 Scatter attivano 10 Free Spins, che possono essere riattivati se sui rulli atterrano altri Scatter.\nDopo ogni vincita ci verrà proposto di usufruire della funzione Gamble, che ci dà la possibilità di incrementare la somma ottenuta ma anche di perderla completamente.\n\nDomande Frequenti \nA quanto corrisponde il ritorno teorico al giocatore?\n\nIn questo gioco il valore RTP è del 96%.\n\n\n\nQual è la vincita massima di Gold Gold Gold?\n\nSi può vincere fino a 2.000 volte la scommessa.\n\n\n\nPosso giocare anche su smartphone?\n\nSì, perché Gold Gold Gold ha un’architettura HTML5 che la fa girare su tutti i dispositivi mobili e con qualsiasi sistema operativo.\n\n\n\n",

They now try with Gold Gold Gold, a game with a retro style with classic symbols such as bells, stars and diamonds. The main characteristic is simplicity which is immediately visible in the graphics, without any frills. The purple background contrasts with the gold coins at the base of the main screen and the bordeaux colored grid. The symbols are drawn in an elementary way but the large size benefits the playability. The buttons are located on the right, one to start the game, one for the bets and one to access the paytable. An 80s dance style music accompanies us during the spins, with some sound effects after the wins.\nFeatures of Gold Gold Gold\nBooming Games has also maintained tradition on other aspects as well, such as the size of the grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are variable and we can decide how many to activate up to a maximum of 20. The minimum cost of a single game is € 0.01 per line, so if we have activated 20, the cost will be € 0.20. The Max Bet button allows us to set the maximum bet with a single click. There is also the Turbo button that speeds up the fall of the symbols, and the Autoplay, which starts the automatic spins. The volatility is medium, the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96%.\nHow to win at Gold Gold Gold\nTo know in detail the payment of symbols, we recommend accessing the payment table, while here we will provide a brief overview. First and foremost, to win you need to create combos of 3, 4 or 5 identical symbols from left to right. The chips with the playing card suits (hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs) are worth less, followed by the gold bars, the star and the bell. The Wild pays more than all regular symbols and acts as a Joker, replacing any symbol except for the Scatter. The symbols can land stacked, with increased chances of obtaining a series of winning icons. The Gold Gold Gold symbol is the Scatter and is also paying, indeed it is the highest paying symbol in the game. 3 to 5 Scatters activate 10 Free Spins, which can be reactivated if other Scatters land on the reels.\nAfter each win, we will be offered to use the Gamble feature, which gives us the opportunity to increase the amount obtained but also to lose it completely.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\nIn this game, the RTP value is 96%.\n\nWhat is the maximum win of Gold Gold Gold?\nYou can win up to 2,000 times the bet.\n\nCan I play on smartphones as well?\nYes, because Gold Gold Gold has an HTML5 architecture that makes it run on all mobile devices and with any operating system.\n            ",

They now try with Gold Gold Gold, a game with a retro style with classic symbols such as bells, stars and diamonds. The main characteristic is simplicity which is immediately visible in the graphics, without any frills. The purple background contrasts with the gold coins at the base of the main screen and the bordeaux colored grid. The symbols are drawn in an elementary way but the large size benefits the playability. The buttons are located on the right, one to start the game, one for the bets and one to access the paytable. An 80s dance style music accompanies us during the spins, with some sound effects after the wins.\nFeatures of Gold Gold Gold\nBooming Games has also maintained tradition on other aspects as well, such as the size of the grid, with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are variable and we can decide how many to activate up to a maximum of 20. The minimum cost of a single game is € 0.01 per line, so if we have activated 20, the cost will be € 0.20. The Max Bet button allows us to set the maximum bet with a single click. There is also the Turbo button that speeds up the fall of the symbols, and the Autoplay, which starts the automatic spins. The volatility is medium, the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96%.\nHow to win at Gold Gold Gold\nTo know in detail the payment of symbols, we recommend accessing the payment table, while here we will provide a brief overview. First and foremost, to win you need to create combos of 3, 4 or 5 identical symbols from left to right. The chips with the playing card suits (hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs) are worth less, followed by the gold bars, the star and the bell. The Wild pays more than all regular symbols and acts as a Joker, replacing any symbol except for the Scatter. The symbols can land stacked, with increased chances of obtaining a series of winning icons. The Gold Gold Gold symbol is the Scatter and is also paying, indeed it is the highest paying symbol in the game. 3 to 5 Scatters activate 10 Free Spins, which can be reactivated if other Scatters land on the reels.\nAfter each win, we will be offered to use the Gamble feature, which gives us the opportunity to increase the amount obtained but also to lose it completely.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\nIn this game, the RTP value is 96%.\n\nWhat is the maximum win of Gold Gold Gold?\nYou can win up to 2,000 times the bet.\n\nCan I play on smartphones as well?\nYes, because Gold Gold Gold has an HTML5 architecture that makes it run on all mobile devices and with any operating system.\n            ",
