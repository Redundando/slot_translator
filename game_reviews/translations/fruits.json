The clean and simple features such as Mystery Wrappers, Sticky Fruit Spins, and Lightning Rounds keep this game fresh from the first round until the end of time, a slot with true classic ingredients that is perfect for experienced gamblers.\n\n\"Fruits\" is a video slot with 116 fixed lines on a 6-reel area featuring 12 delicious symbols that spin individually in every position of the reel. The reel area adapts to the orientation used on the device, all to offer the best possible gaming experience on mobile and tablet.\n\nA fruity graphics\nThe \"Fruits\" slot from Nolimit City has fully embraced the mobile platform, offering gameplay mechanics that perfectly match the player's style. We weren't sure what to expect when we heard that Nolimit City was launching a casino game called \"Fruits\". Would it be a vintage-style fruit machine? Would it be a modern version of a classic? Additionally, there is no shortage of slots with fruit symbols, so what could the developer do with this title?\n\n\"Fruits\" is a colorful 6-reel, 116-payline slot from Nolimit City. Check out the Mystery Wrappers that can transform between 4 and 9 symbol positions to match each other. There are also streaks and a free test spin available. Play this medium to high variation game on all devices from 10p to £100 per spin.\n\nLaunched in 2019, \"Fruits\" truly brings something new to the table! First and foremost, it is built on an unusual set of reels - a nice break from the series of games that follow a predictable 5x3 pattern. Although the format hasn't entirely worn out, we've seen many games take on the same shape.\n\nThe truly interesting feature of \"Fruits\" isn't even an in-game bonus or anything like that. It is certainly a slot game built with a mobile-first attitude. The multitude of paylines are not static - they are adaptive, going from left to right when the device is held in landscape mode, and from top to bottom when the device is in portrait mode!\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nHere there is more of a social game feel to the imagery. You'll see 10 different fruit symbols spinning around the reels. The best payer is the blackberry which awards 50 times your bet if you land 6 on the same payline. There is also a wild, the star, which replaces all standard symbols. There are three extras on offer in the Fruit.\n\nThe Mystery Wrappers have the feature of being able to land randomly on any game basis. Between 4 and 9 symbol positions will be overlaid on the Mystery Wrappers. These all transform into the same matching symbol and a new payout calculation is made.\n\nSticky Fruit Spins Feature - this feature is triggered by landing 4 of the same matching symbol on reels 1 and 2. These symbols, plus any that match elsewhere on the reels, are held and the reels spin again. The streak continues to spin until a new matching symbol hits. A final payout calculation is then made.\n\nLightning Rounds Feature - land 3 or more of the Lightning Bolt symbol to activate this round. You will then get 5 free spins on the 4x3 part of the reels to collect as many Lightning Bolt symbols as possible. The more you collect, the bigger the prizes on offer. The 2x2 reels are also in play here. These can add additional free spins to the total or provide an update on the symbols.\n\nThe design here is simply made, but it works quite well. There's a decent variety on offer from the features as well. The variance is in the medium to high range. And with a potential maximum payout of 2,900 times your bet on each spin, \"Fruits\" can offer some truly tasty action.\n\nWhen it comes to free spins, keep an eye out for the lightning bolt symbols as these can trigger the lightning rounds! When three or more of these symbols land on the same spin, the player is awarded 5 extra spins. The aim of this part of the game is to collect as many lightning bolt symbols as possible within the 4x3 reel area.\n\nIt is also possible to trigger additional power-ups or bonus spins during this feature, and they will enhance the payout when a winning combination is reached. There is no limit to the number of power-ups that can be applied, meaning that the potential for a significant win is good.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nIf you have just discovered this software provider for Online Gambling and want to bet on other Slot Machines produced by Nolimit, you should also try playing \"Ice Ice Yeti\" by Nolimit City which is excellent and offers winnings of up to 8,820 times your bet on each spin! As an experienced gambler, you will enjoy the thrilling action and exciting gameplay of \"Fruits\" and other similar slot machine games produced by Nolimit City.",

This lush and simple video slot with an unconventional reel configuration invites you to play in portrait mode on your mobile device. Clean and simple features such as Mystery Wrappers, Sticky Fruit Spins, and Lightning Rounds keep the game fresh from the first round to the end of time, making it a slot with true classic ingredients.\n\n\"Fruits\" is a video slot with 116 fixed lines on a 6-reel area with 12 delicious symbols spinning individually in every position on the reel. The reel area adapts to the orientation used on the device, all to offer the best possible gaming experience on mobile and tablet.\n\nA fruity graphics design\n\nNolimit City's \"Fruits\" slot game has embraced the mobile platform completely, offering a gameplay that fits the player's style perfectly. We weren't sure what to expect when we heard that Nolimit City was launching a casino game called \"Fruits.\" Would it be a vintage-style fruit machine? Would it be a modern version of a classic? Besides, there is no shortage of slots with fruit symbols, so what could the developer do with this title?\n\n\"Fruits\" is a colorful 6-reel, 116-payline slot from Nolimit City. Check out the Mystery Wrappers here which can transform between 4 and 9 symbol positions to match. Also on offer are streaks and a free spin round. Play this medium to high variance game on all devices from 10p to £100 per spin.\n\nLaunched in 2019, \"Fruits\" really brings something new to the table! First of all, it's built on an unusual set of reels - a nice break from the string of games that follow a predictable 5x3 pattern. Although the format is not yet completely tired, we have seen many games take the same form.\n\nBut the really interesting feature of \"Fruits\" is not even an in-game bonus or anything like that. It is definitely a slot game built with a mobile-first attitude. The multitude of paylines are not static - they are adaptive, going from left to right when the device is held in landscape mode, and top to bottom when the device is in portrait mode!\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nHere there is more than just a social game feel to the visuals. You'll see 10 different fruit symbols spinning around the reels. The top payer is the blackberry that awards 50 times your bet if you land 6 on the same payline. There is also a wild, the star, which replaces all standard symbols. There are 3 extras on offer in \"Fruits\".\n\nThe Mystery Wrappers have the feature of being able to land randomly on any game spin. Between 4 and 9 symbol positions are overlaid with the Mystery Wrappers. These all transform into the same corresponding symbol and a new payout calculation is made.\n\nSticky Fruit Spins feature - this feature is triggered by landing 4 of the same matching symbols on reels 1 and 2. These symbols, plus any matching ones elsewhere on the reels, are held, and the reels spin again. The streak continues to spin as long as a new matching symbol hits. A final payout calculation is then made.\n\nLightning Rounds feature - land 3 or more of the Lightning Bolt symbol to trigger this round. You will then get 5 free spins on the 4x3 part of the reels to collect as many Lightning Bolt symbols as possible. The more you collect, the bigger the prizes on offer. The 2x2 reels are also in play here. These can add additional free spins to the total or provide a symbol upgrade.\n\nThe design here is simply done, but it works quite well. There's a decent variety on offer even from the features. The variance is medium to high. And with a potential maximum payout of 2,900 times your bet on each spin, \"Fruits\" can offer some truly juicy action.\n\nWhen it comes to free spins, watch out for the Lightning Bolt symbols as these can trigger the Lightning Rounds! When three or more of these symbols land on the same spin, the player is awarded 5 extra spins. The aim of this part of the game is to collect as many Lightning Bolt symbols as possible within the 4x3 reel area.\n\nIt is also possible to trigger additional enhancements or bonus spins during this feature, and they will improve the payout when a winning combination is achieved. There is no limit to the number of enhancements that can be applied, which means the potential for a significant win is good.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nIf you have just discovered this online gambling software provider and want to bet on other slot machines produced by Nolimit, I also recommend playing Nolimit City's \"Ice Ice Yeti,\" which is excellent and offers wins of up to 8,820 times your bet on every spin!"

Additionally, there is no shortage of slots with fruit symbols, so what could the developer do with this title?\n\n\"Fruits\" is a colorful 6-reel, 116-payline slot from Nolimit City. Check out the Mystery Wrappers that can transform between 4 and 9 symbol positions to match each other. There are also streaks and a free test spin available. Play this medium to high variation game on all devices from 10p to £100 per spin.\n\nLaunched in 2019, \"Fruits\" truly brings something new to the table! First and foremost, it is built on an unusual set of reels - a nice break from the series of games that follow a predictable 5x3 pattern. Although the format hasn't entirely worn out, we've seen many games take on the same shape.\n\nThe truly interesting feature of \"Fruits\" isn't even an in-game bonus or anything like that. It is certainly a slot game built with a mobile-first attitude. The multitude of paylines are not static - they are adaptive, going from left to right when the device is held in landscape mode, and from top to bottom when the device is in portrait mode!\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nHere there is more of a social game feel to the imagery. You'll see 10 different fruit symbols spinning around the reels. The best payer is the blackberry which awards 50 times your bet if you land 6 on the same payline. There is also a wild, the star, which replaces all standard symbols. There are three extras on offer in the Fruit.\n\nThe Mystery Wrappers have the feature of being able to land randomly on any game basis. Between 4 and 9 symbol positions will be overlaid on the Mystery Wrappers. These all transform into the same matching symbol and a new payout calculation is made.\n\nSticky Fruit Spins Feature - this feature is triggered by landing 4 of the same matching symbol on reels 1 and 2. These symbols, plus any that match elsewhere on the reels, are held and the reels spin again. The streak continues to spin until a new matching symbol hits. A final payout calculation is then made.\n\nLightning Rounds Feature - land 3 or more of the Lightning Bolt symbol to activate this round. You will then get 5 free spins on the 4x3 part of the reels to collect as many Lightning Bolt symbols as possible. The more you collect, the bigger the prizes on offer. The 2x2 reels are also in play here. These can add additional free spins to the total or provide an update on the symbols.\n\nThe design here is simply made, but it works quite well. There's a decent variety on offer from the features as well. The variance is in the medium to high range. And with a potential maximum payout of 2,900 times your bet on each spin, \"Fruits\" can offer some truly tasty action.\n\nWhen it comes to free spins, keep an eye out for the lightning bolt symbols as these can trigger the lightning rounds! When three or more of these symbols land on the same spin, the player is awarded 5 extra spins. The aim of this part of the game is to collect as many lightning bolt symbols as possible within the 4x3 reel area.\n\nIt is also possible to trigger additional power-ups or bonus spins during this feature, and they will enhance the payout when a winning combination is reached. There is no limit to the number of power-ups that can be applied, meaning that the potential for a significant win is good.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nIf you have just discovered this software provider for Online Gambling and want to bet on other Slot Machines produced by Nolimit, you should also try playing \"Ice Ice Yeti\" by Nolimit City which is excellent and offers winnings of up to 8,820 times your bet on each spin! As an experienced gambler, you will enjoy the thrilling action and exciting gameplay of \"Fruits\" and other similar slot machine games produced by Nolimit City.\n            ",

This lush and simple video slot with its unique reel configuration invites you to play in portrait mode on your cell phone. The clean and simple features such as Mystery Wrappers, Sticky Fruit Spins, and Lightning Rounds keep this game fresh from the first round until the end of time, a slot with true classic ingredients that is perfect for experienced gamblers.\n\n\"Fruits\" is a video slot with 116 fixed lines on a 6-reel area featuring 12 delicious symbols that spin individually in every position of the reel. The reel area adapts to the orientation used on the device, all to offer the best possible gaming experience on mobile and tablet.\n\nA fruity graphics\nThe \"Fruits\" slot from Nolimit City has fully embraced the mobile platform, offering gameplay mechanics that perfectly match the player's style. We weren't sure what to expect when we heard that Nolimit City was launching a casino game called \"Fruits\". Would it be a vintage-style fruit machine? Would it be a modern version of a classic? Additionally, there is no shortage of slots with fruit symbols, so what could the developer do with this title?\n\n\"Fruits\" is a colorful 6-reel, 116-payline slot from Nolimit City. Check out the Mystery Wrappers that can transform between 4 and 9 symbol positions to match each other. There are also streaks and a free test spin available. Play this medium to high variation game on all devices from 10p to £100 per spin.\n\nLaunched in 2019, \"Fruits\" truly brings something new to the table! First and foremost, it is built on an unusual set of reels - a nice break from the series of games that follow a predictable 5x3 pattern. Although the format hasn't entirely worn out, we've seen many games take on the same shape.\n\nThe truly interesting feature of \"Fruits\" isn't even an in-game bonus or anything like that. It is certainly a slot game built with a mobile-first attitude. The multitude of paylines are not static - they are adaptive, going from left to right when the device is held in landscape mode, and from top to bottom when the device is in portrait mode!\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nHere there is more of a social game feel to the imagery. You'll see 10 different fruit symbols spinning around the reels. The best payer is the blackberry which awards 50 times your bet if you land 6 on the same payline. There is also a wild, the star, which replaces all standard symbols. There are three extras on offer in the Fruit.\n\nThe Mystery Wrappers have the feature of being able to land randomly on any game basis. Between 4 and 9 symbol positions will be overlaid on the Mystery Wrappers. These all transform into the same matching symbol and a new payout calculation is made.\n\nSticky Fruit Spins Feature - this feature is triggered by landing 4 of the same matching symbol on reels 1 and 2. These symbols, plus any that match elsewhere on the reels, are held and the reels spin again. The streak continues to spin until a new matching symbol hits. A final payout calculation is then made.\n\nLightning Rounds Feature - land 3 or more of the Lightning Bolt symbol to activate this round. You will then get 5 free spins on the 4x3 part of the reels to collect as many Lightning Bolt symbols as possible. The more you collect, the bigger the prizes on offer. The 2x2 reels are also in play here. These can add additional free spins to the total or provide an update on the symbols.\n\nThe design here is simply made, but it works quite well. There's a decent variety on offer from the features as well. The variance is in the medium to high range. And with a potential maximum payout of 2,900 times your bet on each spin, \"Fruits\" can offer some truly tasty action.\n\nWhen it comes to free spins, keep an eye out for the lightning bolt symbols as these can trigger the lightning rounds! When three or more of these symbols land on the same spin, the player is awarded 5 extra spins. The aim of this part of the game is to collect as many lightning bolt symbols as possible within the 4x3 reel area.\n\nIt is also possible to trigger additional power-ups or bonus spins during this feature, and they will enhance the payout when a winning combination is reached. There is no limit to the number of power-ups that can be applied, meaning that the potential for a significant win is good.\n\nOther similar slot machines\nIf you have just discovered this software provider for Online Gambling and want to bet on other Slot Machines produced by Nolimit, you should also try playing \"Ice Ice Yeti\" by Nolimit City which is excellent and offers winnings of up to 8,820 times your bet on each spin! As an experienced gambler, you will enjoy the thrilling action and exciting gameplay of \"Fruits\" and other similar slot machine games produced by Nolimit City.\n            ",
