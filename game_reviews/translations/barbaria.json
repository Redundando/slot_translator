Set in the days of ancient Rome amid barbarian warfare, Barbaria is a stunning slot game, with gameplay that is both simple and intuitive and graphics that are truly impressive.\nAs you first set your eyes on Barbaria, you'll be captivated by the stunningly realistic, cartoon-style graphics. The symbols on the reels are exceptionally well-designed weapons that were commonly used during the barbarian era.\nBarbaria also offers players a comprehensive paytable that lists the value of all symbols and a guide to learning the tricks and features of the slot.\nThe game structure features five reels with twenty paylines, offering ample opportunity to win big prizes. The paylines are fixed, so players must bet on all twenty, with a minimum bet of 20 cents and a maximum of €40 per spin. The value of the bet can be adjusted to suit individual preferences by changing the coin value, which ranges from 1 cent to €2.\nThe game's theoretical return to player of 96.35% is in line with most online casino slot games. The game's volatility is medium, which means that while larger wins may be rarer, smaller prizes can be achieved more easily.\nBarbaria's symbols are primarily weapons, including a helmet, a heavy hammer, a horn, crossed axes and a single axe, as well as a thigh of unspecified animal. There's also a Wild symbol, representing a horned helmet, which acts as a joker, and a Scatter symbol, represented by a medallion, which triggers the Free Spins bonus when it appears on the reels at least three times.\nFinally, the game features a Bonus game, triggered by the appearance of three skull symbols on the reels, which functions like a wheel of fortune, offering multipliers ranging from x20 to x80.

The gameplay is easy to pick up, and the graphics of the game are astounding. Barbaria's symbols consist mainly of weapons used during the barbarian era, and its Wild symbol, a helmet with horns, replaces all other symbols except the Scatter to complete winning combinations. The medallion Scatter symbol can activate the free spins bonus that rewards the player with 15 free spins. Three symbols depicting a skull will activate the bonus game, a fortune wheel that gives multipliers ranging from x20 to x80.\n\nPay lines, betting, and RTP\n\nBarbaria has five reels and twenty pay lines that are fixed, with a minimum bet of 20 cents and a maximum of 40 € per spin. However, players may adjust the bet amount according to their needs, depending on the value of the token ranging from 1 cent to 2 €. Barbaria's RTP is 96.35%, which is a good return compared to most slot games found in online casinos. This slot machine's volatility is medium, meaning players can rely on small prizes that can be obtained more easily, albeit not frequently.\n\nSymbols and their significance\n\nBarbaria's symbols are weapons used during the barbarian era, including a helmet, a heavy hammer, a horn, crossed axes, a single axe, as well as a leg of an unspecified animal. The Wild symbol is a helmet with horns and acts like other Wild symbols by replacing all other symbols except the Scatter to complete a winning combination. The game's Scatter symbol is a medallion that can activate the free spins bonus, which rewards the player with 15 free spins. Three symbols that depict a skull can activate the bonus game, a fortune wheel that gives multipliers ranging from x20 to x80.\n\nFree Spin and Bonus game details\n\nThe medallion Scatter symbol can activate the free spins bonus that rewards the player with 15 free spins. Triggering the bonus game requires three symbols that depict a skull. This leads to a fortune wheel that gives multipliers ranging from x20 to x80. The bonus game can be randomly triggered during a spin and can potentially increase the player's winnings substantially.\n\nGraphics and overall game experience\n\nBarbaria is a beautifully crafted slot machine game. Upon playing, you can immediately tell how much effort and work went into making the game's graphics as realistic as possible. From the weapons on the reels to the subtle animations, the game's cartoon-style images are accurately reproduced with remarkable realism and quality, making for an immersive gaming experience. Barbaria is easy to play, offers a variety of betting options, has a good RTP and volatility, and comes with free spins and bonus features, giving players plenty of chances to win big. Overall, Barbaria is an excellent game that is sure to provide players with endless hours of fun and unmatched gaming experience.\n\n        \n            ",

The graphic settings can then be modified based on the device on which you are playing, whether it's a computer or a mobile device like an iPad or smartphone.\n\nThe symbols on the reels are exceptionally designed and drawn, and are mainly composed of the weapons commonly used during the barbarian era.\n\nBarbaria also offers its players a convenient paytable, which allows you to know the value of all symbols, and a guide to learn the tricks and features of the slot.\n\nGame structure, betting range, RTP and volatility\n\nWith the Barbaria slot machine you have the opportunity to win some pretty good prizes through its five reels and twenty pay lines. The paylines are fixed, so you must necessarily bet on all of them, with a minimum bet of 20 cents and a maximum of 40 € per spin. You can adjust the bet amount according to your needs by modifying the value of the token, which ranges from 1 cent to 2 €.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player is a good 96.35%, perfectly in line with most slot games found in online casinos.\n\nAs for volatility, Barbaria's is medium, which means that although winning streaks are not so frequent, players can also count on small prizes that can be obtained more easily.\n\nSymbols and special features\n\nAs we mentioned, Barbaria's symbols are primarily represented by weapons used during the barbarian era: we have a helmet, a heavy hammer, a horn, crossed axes, a single axe, as well as a leg of an unspecified animal.\n\nThere is a Wild symbol that is a helmet with horns and acts as the usual wild, replacing all other symbols except the Scatter to complete a winning combination.\n\nThe medallion is instead the game's Scatter: when it appears at least three times on the reels, it activates the Free Spins bonus, which allows you to get 15 free spins.\n\nIf three symbols depicting a skull appear on the screen, the Bonus game is activated, which is a kind of wheel of fortune that gives multipliers ranging from x20 to x80.\n            ",

The graphic settings can then be modified based on the device on which you are playing, whether it's a computer or a mobile device like an iPad or smartphone.\n\nThe symbols on the reels are exceptionally designed and drawn, and are mainly composed of the weapons commonly used during the barbarian era.\n\nBarbaria also offers its players a convenient paytable, which allows you to know the value of all symbols, and a guide to learn the tricks and features of the slot.\n\nGame structure, betting range, RTP and volatility\n\nWith the Barbaria slot machine you have the opportunity to win some pretty good prizes through its five reels and twenty pay lines. The paylines are fixed, so you must necessarily bet on all of them, with a minimum bet of 20 cents and a maximum of 40 € per spin. You can adjust the bet amount according to your needs by modifying the value of the token, which ranges from 1 cent to 2 €.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player is a good 96.35%, perfectly in line with most slot games found in online casinos.\n\nAs for volatility, Barbaria's is medium, which means that although winning streaks are not so frequent, players can also count on small prizes that can be obtained more easily.\n\nSymbols and special features\n\nAs we mentioned, Barbaria's symbols are primarily represented by weapons used during the barbarian era: we have a helmet, a heavy hammer, a horn, crossed axes, a single axe, as well as a leg of an unspecified animal.\n\nThere is a Wild symbol that is a helmet with horns and acts as the usual wild, replacing all other symbols except the Scatter to complete a winning combination.\n\nThe medallion is instead the game's Scatter: when it appears at least three times on the reels, it activates the Free Spins bonus, which allows you to get 15 free spins.\n\nIf three symbols depicting a skull appear on the screen, the Bonus game is activated, which is a kind of wheel of fortune that gives multipliers ranging from x20 to x80.\n            ",
