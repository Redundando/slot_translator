Set in a clandestine den, Dog Town Deal features a cast of lovable canines playing the role of gamblers, with each chip stamped with a paw print and Wild symbol depicted as a stylized bone. The background sees elegantly dressed dogs standing beside the game table. Tapping into the style of cartoon animation, each character is filled with personality, bringing the game to life. The attention to detail here is astounding; it's clear that Quickspin has left no stone unturned in crafting this masterpiece. An enchanting jazz soundtrack complements the gameplay, immersing players in the game's world.\n\nDog Town Deal features a classic 5x3 reel with a multiplier column ranging from 1x to 15x on the left-hand side, coupled with a row of progressive numbers from 16 to 21 to assist with Blackjack. There are 20 fixed paylines, and the minimum bet starts at 0.20€. Toggling the thunderbolt button allows players to speed up the spinning action, while the Autoplay feature can be activated to play from anywhere between 10 to 1,000 automatic spins.

The least profitable symbols are the four colourful chips with roughly the same value. The 4 dogs (Chihuahua, Beagle, Bulldog, and Greyhound) are more rewarding in terms of payout potential, with the Greyhound rewarding 3x more than the other three breeds. The Wild symbol serves as a substitute for all other symbols bar the special ones, and any combinations featuring 3 or more Wild symbols are rewarded with double the score of the Greyhound. The Scatter symbols are simple playing cards.

First and foremost, let us take a moment to appreciate the outstanding graphics that have become synonymous with this software house. Set in a clandestine den, Dog Town Deal features a cast of lovable canines playing the role of gamblers, with each chip stamped with a paw print and Wild symbol depicted as a stylized bone. The background sees elegantly dressed dogs standing beside the game table. Tapping into the style of cartoon animation, each character is filled with personality, bringing the game to life. The attention to detail here is astounding; it's clear that Quickspin has left no stone unturned in crafting this masterpiece. An enchanting jazz soundtrack complements the gameplay, immersing players in the game's world.\n\nDog Town Deal features a classic 5x3 reel with a multiplier column ranging from 1x to 15x on the left-hand side, coupled with a row of progressive numbers from 16 to 21 to assist with Blackjack. There are 20 fixed paylines, and the minimum bet starts at 0.20€, with the potential to win up to 1,116 times your initial stake. Toggling the thunderbolt button allows players to speed up the spinning action, while the Autoplay feature can be activated to play from anywhere between 10 to 1,000 automatic spins. The game's volatility is set at low, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.15%.\n\nTo give yourself the best chance of winning, keep an eye out for combo sets of 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols adjacent to each other starting from the first reel on the left and progressing towards the right. The least profitable symbols are the four colourful chips with roughly the same value. The 4 dogs (Chihuahua, Beagle, Bulldog, and Greyhound) are more rewarding in terms of payout potential, with the Greyhound rewarding 3x more than the other three breeds. The Wild symbol serves as a substitute for all other symbols bar the special ones, and any combinations featuring 3 or more Wild symbols are rewarded with double the score of the Greyhound. The Scatter symbols are simple playing cards. Landing two during a single spin will be flipped over; if the sum of the card total equals 16 or more, then a multiplier will be applied to the initial bet. If three or more Scatters land in a single spin, then up to 15 Free Spins will be awarded. During these spins, each winning combo delivers a card with which to play Blackjack, unlocking chances to hit higher payout multipliers.\n\nFAQ:\n-Where can I find Dog Town Deal?\nThis exciting new game will soon be available on all major Italian casinos that carry an AAMS certification.\n\n-What is the volatility of this game?\nThe volatility is low.\n\n-What is the maximum payout of Dog Town Deal?\nThe maximum payout is up to 1,116 times the initial stake.\n            ",

Set in a clandestine den, the game features a cast of lovable canines playing the role of gamblers, each chip stamped with a paw print. The game features 20 fixed paylines, and the minimum bet starts at 0.20€ with the potential to win up to 1,116 times your initial stake. The game's volatility is set at low, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.15%.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nDog Town Deal boasts outstanding graphics, with each character filled with personality, bringing the game to life. The attention to detail is astounding, and Quickspin has left no stone unturned in crafting this masterpiece. The game's enchanting jazz soundtrack complements the gameplay, immersing players in the game's world.\n\nGame Mechanics and Features\n\nDog Town Deal features a classic 5x3 reel with a multiplier column ranging from 1x to 15x on the left-hand side, with a row of progressive numbers from 16 to 21 to assist with Blackjack. The game includes an Autoplay feature that can be activated to play from anywhere between 10 to 1,000 automatic spins. The game's volatility is set at low, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.15%. During the Free Spins feature, each winning combo delivers a card with which to play Blackjack, unlocking chances to hit higher payout multipliers.\n\nHigh and Low Paying Symbols\n\nTo give yourself the best chance of winning, look out for combo sets of 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols adjacent to each other starting from the first reel on the left and progressing towards the right. The colourful chips are the least profitable symbols, with roughly the same value. The game features four dogs (Chihuahua, Beagle, Bulldog, and Greyhound), which are more rewarding in terms of payout potential. The Greyhound rewards 3x more than the other three breeds. The Wild symbol serves as a substitute for all other symbols bar the special ones, and any combinations featuring 3 or more Wild symbols are rewarded with double the score of the Greyhound.\n\nScatters and Free Spins\n\nThe Scatter symbols are simple playing cards. Land two during a single spin, and they will be flipped over. If the sum of the card total equals 16 or more, then a multiplier will be applied to the initial bet. If three or more Scatters land in a single spin, then up to 15 Free Spins will be awarded.\n\n        \n            ",

First and foremost, let us take a moment to appreciate the outstanding graphics that have become synonymous with this software house. Set in a clandestine den, Dog Town Deal features a cast of lovable canines playing the role of gamblers, with each chip stamped with a paw print and Wild symbol depicted as a stylized bone. The background sees elegantly dressed dogs standing beside the game table. Tapping into the style of cartoon animation, each character is filled with personality, bringing the game to life. The attention to detail here is astounding; it's clear that Quickspin has left no stone unturned in crafting this masterpiece. An enchanting jazz soundtrack complements the gameplay, immersing players in the game's world.\n\nDog Town Deal features a classic 5x3 reel with a multiplier column ranging from 1x to 15x on the left-hand side, coupled with a row of progressive numbers from 16 to 21 to assist with Blackjack. There are 20 fixed paylines, and the minimum bet starts at 0.20€, with the potential to win up to 1,116 times your initial stake. Toggling the thunderbolt button allows players to speed up the spinning action, while the Autoplay feature can be activated to play from anywhere between 10 to 1,000 automatic spins. The game's volatility is set at low, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.15%.\n\nTo give yourself the best chance of winning, keep an eye out for combo sets of 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols adjacent to each other starting from the first reel on the left and progressing towards the right. The least profitable symbols are the four colourful chips with roughly the same value. The 4 dogs (Chihuahua, Beagle, Bulldog, and Greyhound) are more rewarding in terms of payout potential, with the Greyhound rewarding 3x more than the other three breeds. The Wild symbol serves as a substitute for all other symbols bar the special ones, and any combinations featuring 3 or more Wild symbols are rewarded with double the score of the Greyhound. The Scatter symbols are simple playing cards. Landing two during a single spin will be flipped over; if the sum of the card total equals 16 or more, then a multiplier will be applied to the initial bet. If three or more Scatters land in a single spin, then up to 15 Free Spins will be awarded. During these spins, each winning combo delivers a card with which to play Blackjack, unlocking chances to hit higher payout multipliers.\n\nFAQ:\n-Where can I find Dog Town Deal?\nThis exciting new game will soon be available on all major Italian casinos that carry an AAMS certification.\n\n-What is the volatility of this game?\nThe volatility is low.\n\n-What is the maximum payout of Dog Town Deal?\nThe maximum payout is up to 1,116 times the initial stake.\n            ",
