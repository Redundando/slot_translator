The howling wolf at the moon is the Bonus symbol: when it appears 3 times, 8 free spins are activated, with 4 times there will be 10 spins, with 5 there will be 12 spins, and with 6, there will be 15 spins.\n\nDuring free spins, the golden-backed werewolf symbol may appear, and in that case, regular symbols are removed and replaced by the wolf symbol, and you are entitled to an additional free spin.\n            ",

A European legend that has become universal over the years is undoubtedly that of the werewolf, in which a man transforms into a bloodthirsty wolf during full moon nights. And it is precisely among the cobblestone streets of a small village that Curse of the Werewolf Megaways is set. The graphics resemble those of cartoons, with characters defined in every detail. Even facial expressions are so realistic as to give us an idea of the protagonists' character. The musical aspect contributes to creating the right amount of suspense, while the animations that occur after each win help us to immerse ourselves even more in the story.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nThe game grid has 6 reels and 6 baseline lines, a number that changes based on the size of the symbol, which can vary randomly. There are 46,656 ways to win and the volatility is high, meaning that the game pays less frequently, but when you win, the amounts are always at a certain level. The bet ranges from a minimum of €0.10 to a maximum of €100. When more wins occur on the same payline, only the highest one is paid out, whereas when winning combinations are found on different lines, the amounts are added up. Curse of the Werewolf Megaways has an RTP of 96.5% and up to 10 to 100 auto-spins can be activated.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Curse of the Werewolf Megaways\n\nThe cards from 10 to Ace are the symbols that pay the least of all, followed by the nerd with the green cap, the innkeeper with the black mustache, the innkeeper's daughter, and the young man with the brown cap. The werewolf is the highest-paying symbol of all. The parchment with the scratch of the wolf and the Wild writing represents the game's wild card, replacing all regular symbols but not the special ones. The wolf at sunset is the Mystery symbol, and when it appears, it transforms into another paying symbol, creating winning combinations. During regular play, stacked symbols can appear, guaranteeing big wins, or a Big Win Spin can be activated, which guarantees multiple paying combinations on different game lines. The howling wolf at the moon is the Bonus symbol: when it appears 3 times, 8 free spins are activated, with 4 times there will be 10 spins, with 5 there will be 12 spins, and with 6, there will be 15 spins.\n\nDuring free spins, the golden-backed werewolf symbol may appear, and in that case, regular symbols are removed and replaced by the wolf symbol, and you are entitled to an additional free spin.\n        ",
