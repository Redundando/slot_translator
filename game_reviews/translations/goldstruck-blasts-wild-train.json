The music complements perfectly the cartoon-like graphics of the slot. On the wooden scene objects that surround the reels, you can see a win counter that shows free spins and jackpot wins.\n\nThe symbols include colored gemstones, a pigeon in a cage, a bearded gold prospector, a lantern, and gold nugget symbols. When this last symbol appears on the reels simultaneously with a minecart and a drill, the Wild Train bonus feature is activated.\n\nHow to Trigger the Bonus Free Spins Features\n\nThere are no Scatter symbols in this game, so the only way to activate the free spins round is to collect enough gold nuggets during the Wild Train bonus game, which is activated randomly.\n\nEvery time the Wild Train bonus symbol appears on reel 5 simultaneously with at least one gold nugget Wild, the Bonus game starts. The train goes around, collecting gold nuggets and helmets.\n\nAs the train collects symbols, the girl rises with her lift, filling the space next to reel 1 with nuggets.

This can activate both the free spins and a jackpot bonus game.\n\nRound of Free Spins\n\nYou will need to collect 5 gold nuggets in the same round to trigger the free spins round. You will receive 3 FS to start. The Wild Train cart will be transferred from the initial spin, and step by step, you can collect gold nuggets and helmets as in the base game. The difference is that you get an additional spin for each helmet or gold nugget you collect, and the feature ends when there are no more free spins left.\n\nFixed Jackpot\n\nIf you are lucky enough to reach the top of the bonus bar, you will receive a fixed jackpot worth 1,000 times your bet!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are the strengths of the new slot Goldstruck Blast!?\n\nA fixed jackpot, mobile compatibility, the innovative Gold Drill bonus, and a fixed jackpot of up to 1,000x your bet.

When this last symbol appears on the reels simultaneously with a minecart and a drill, the Wild Train bonus feature is activated.\n\nHow to Trigger the Bonus Free Spins Features\n\nThere are no Scatter symbols in this game, so the only way to activate the free spins round is to collect enough gold nuggets during the Wild Train bonus game, which is activated randomly.\n\nEvery time the Wild Train bonus symbol appears on reel 5 simultaneously with at least one gold nugget Wild, the Bonus game starts. The train goes around, collecting gold nuggets and helmets.\n\nAs the train collects symbols, the girl rises with her lift, filling the space next to reel 1 with nuggets. After the train has finished collecting items, you are awarded a free respin, which could generate even more symbols to collect. This can activate both the free spins and a jackpot bonus game.\n\nRound of Free Spins\n\nYou will need to collect 5 gold nuggets in the same round to trigger the free spins round. You will receive 3 FS to start. The Wild Train cart will be transferred from the initial spin, and step by step, you can collect gold nuggets and helmets as in the base game. The difference is that you get an additional spin for each helmet or gold nugget you collect, and the feature ends when there are no more free spins left.\n\nFixed Jackpot\n\nIf you are lucky enough to reach the top of the bonus bar, you will receive a fixed jackpot worth 1,000 times your bet!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are the strengths of the new slot Goldstruck Blast!?\n\nA fixed jackpot, mobile compatibility, the innovative Gold Drill bonus, and a fixed jackpot of up to 1,000x your bet.
