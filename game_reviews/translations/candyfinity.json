With the provider's name, Yggdrasil, expectations are high, and we must admit that we were not disappointed. Upon opening the slot, we're immediately struck by an explosion of colors and shapes, ranging from red to pink to violet. The background features soft candy roads and snowy peaks of white icing, while the grid is a cookie divided into squares - the positions where our 3-dimensional symbols will land.\nOn the left, you'll find the counter that tells you how many ways to win there are, the value of the multiplier, the button to buy the Bonus, and the Golden Bet that we'll discuss later. Below, you'll find the variable for the bet, the Autoplay button, and Start.\nFeatures of Candyfinity\nThe reels spin smoothly, thanks to the HTML5 technology that allows you to play even on mobile devices. The base layout has 6 reels and 3 rows, with 729 ways to win, although these numbers are destined to soar during the Bonus game.\nThe minimum bet is €0.20, but for an extra €0.10, you can activate the Golden Bet, which increases your chances of getting Bonus symbols.\nWith the Autoplay feature, you can set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins, although the game allows you to make them go on infinitely. If you opt for this solution, it's best to set win and loss limits that will stop the game once exceeded.\nCandyfinity has medium volatility and an RTP of 96%.\nHow to win\nThe gameplay is very interesting. Every winning combination triggers a special function, where the reels move to the right and the winning symbols remain blocked. In the next Respin, a row will be added to the first reel, which will thus host 4 symbols instead of 3. Obtaining another combination will expand the reel to 5 rows, and so on, up to a maximum of 6. With 6 identical symbols, a x2 multiplier will be applied, which will increase by 1 with each subsequent win. The arrival of two Scatters can also trigger or continue the function.\nNow let's take a look at the symbols you'll find in Candyfinity. The playing card suits have a low value, while watermelon, orange slices, blue candy, and red candy pay much more. The Wild serves as a joker and concludes incomplete combos by replacing any symbol except the Scatter. The latter is represented by a gift box. 3, 4, 5, or 6 Scatters reward you with 6, 8, 10, and 12 Free Spins, respectively. Before starting the function, you'll be given the chance to increase the spins, but be careful because the risk is of losing them all.\n\nFAQ\nWhat's the theoretical return to the player (RTP)?\nCandyfinity has an RTP of 96%.\n\nWhere can I find Candyfinity?\nThis game is available on all legal online casinos.\n\nHow can I get Free Spins?\nThere are two ways: the first is to hope that at least 3 Scatters will land on the grid, and the second is to purchase 3 at a cost of 100 times your bet. If you spend a sum equal to 500 times your bet, you'll get 15 free spins (the maximum number).",

On the left, we find the counter that informs us about the number of ways to win, the value of the multiplier, the button to purchase the Bonus, and the golden bet, to be discussed later. At the bottom, we have the betting variance, the Autoplay button, and the Start button.\n\nCandyfinity has a fluid rotation mechanism without any hesitations, thanks to HTML5 technology, which also allows gameplay on mobile devices. The basic layout consists of 6 reels and 3 rows with 729 ways to win, although these numbers are destined to increase during the Bonus game.\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.20, but for an additional €0.10, the Golden Bet can be activated, increasing the chances of getting Bonus symbols. With the Autoplay function, you can choose to set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins, although the game offers the possibility to have them go infinitely. If you opt for this solution, it is better to set the winning and losing limits that will stop the game once exceeded. Candyfinity has medium volatility and an RTP of 96%.\n\nThe game's interesting gameplay mechanism starts with every winning combination launching a special function, where the reels move to the right, and the winning symbols remain blocked. A row will be added to the first reel, which will then host 4 symbols instead of 3 in the following Respin. With another combination, the reel will expand to 5 rows, and so on, up to maximum 6. With 6 identical symbols, a x2 multiplier will be applied, increasing by 1 with each subsequent win. The arrival of two Scatters can also trigger or continue the function.\n\nLet's now look at the symbols in Candyfinity. The playing card suits have a low value, while the watermelon, orange slice, blue candy, and red candy pay much higher. The Wild symbol acts as a Jolly and concludes incomplete combos by replacing any symbol but not the Scatter. The Scatter symbol is represented by a gift box. 3, 4, 5, or 6 Scatters reward respectively with 6, 8, 10, and 12 Free Spins. Before starting the function, you are offered the opportunity to increase the spins, but be careful because the risk is to lose them all.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player (RTP)?\n\nCandyfinity has an RTP of 96%.\n\nWhere can I find Candyfinity?\n\nThis game is available at all legal online casinos.\n\nHow can I get Free Spins?\n\nThere are two ways: the first is to hope that at least 3 Scatters land on the grid, the second is to purchase 3 Scatters at a cost of 100 times the bet. If you spend a sum equal to 500 times the bet, you will get the maximum of 15 free spins.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay and Features\nGraphics and Sound\nSpecial Symbols\nBetting Range\nJackpot\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Welcome to Candyfinity, a world of deliciousness with up to 46,656 ways to win, a golden bet, and various multipliers that ensure stellar wins! This soft slot game is filled with gummy candies, lollipops, sugary glazes, and all kinds of sweets that are the ingredients for this tasty and exciting slot game recently launched in the online entertainment market. With Yggdrasil as the provider, expectations were high and they were surely met. The explosion of colors and shapes, from red to pink and violet, will immediately strike you upon opening the slot game. The background consists of soft roads and snow-capped peaks of white glaze, while the grid is made up of a cookie divided into squares, where our three-dimensional symbols will land. On the left, we find the counter that informs us about the number of ways to win, the value of the multiplier, the button to purchase the Bonus, and the golden bet, to be discussed later. At the bottom, we have the betting variance, the Autoplay button, and the Start button.\n\nCandyfinity has a fluid rotation mechanism without any hesitations, thanks to HTML5 technology, which also allows gameplay on mobile devices. The basic layout consists of 6 reels and 3 rows with 729 ways to win, although these numbers are destined to increase during the Bonus game.\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.20, but for an additional €0.10, the Golden Bet can be activated, increasing the chances of getting Bonus symbols. With the Autoplay function, you can choose to set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins, although the game offers the possibility to have them go infinitely. If you opt for this solution, it is better to set the winning and losing limits that will stop the game once exceeded. Candyfinity has medium volatility and an RTP of 96%.\n\nThe game's interesting gameplay mechanism starts with every winning combination launching a special function, where the reels move to the right, and the winning symbols remain blocked. A row will be added to the first reel, which will then host 4 symbols instead of 3 in the following Respin. With another combination, the reel will expand to 5 rows, and so on, up to maximum 6. With 6 identical symbols, a x2 multiplier will be applied, increasing by 1 with each subsequent win. The arrival of two Scatters can also trigger or continue the function.\n\nLet's now look at the symbols in Candyfinity. The playing card suits have a low value, while the watermelon, orange slice, blue candy, and red candy pay much higher. The Wild symbol acts as a Jolly and concludes incomplete combos by replacing any symbol but not the Scatter. The Scatter symbol is represented by a gift box. 3, 4, 5, or 6 Scatters reward respectively with 6, 8, 10, and 12 Free Spins. Before starting the function, you are offered the opportunity to increase the spins, but be careful because the risk is to lose them all.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player (RTP)?\n\nCandyfinity has an RTP of 96%.\n\nWhere can I find Candyfinity?\n\nThis game is available at all legal online casinos.\n\nHow can I get Free Spins?\n\nThere are two ways: the first is to hope that at least 3 Scatters land on the grid, the second is to purchase 3 Scatters at a cost of 100 times the bet. If you spend a sum equal to 500 times the bet, you will get the maximum of 15 free spins.\n            ",

The basic layout consists of 6 reels and 3 rows with 729 ways to win, although these numbers are destined to increase during the Bonus game. The minimum bet is €0.20, but for an additional €0.10, the Golden Bet can be activated, increasing the chances of getting Bonus symbols. With the Autoplay function, you can choose to set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins, although the game offers the possibility to have them go infinitely. If you opt for this solution, it is better to set the winning and losing limits that will stop the game once exceeded. Candyfinity has medium volatility and an RTP of 96%.\n\nGraphics\n\nCandyfinity is a candy-themed slot game with an explosion of colors and shapes, from red to pink and violet, that will capture your attention immediately upon opening the game. The background consists of soft roads and snow-capped peaks of white glaze, while the grid is made up of a cookie divided into squares. The three-dimensional symbols perfectly fit the game's theme, from gummy candies to lollipops and sugary glazes.\n\nFeatures\n\nCandyfinity has various exciting features, including up to 46,656 ways to win, a golden bet, and various multipliers that ensure stellar wins. With the Golden Bet activated, the chances of getting Bonus symbols increase. The game's interesting gameplay mechanism starts with every winning combination launching a special function, where the reels move to the right, and the winning symbols remain blocked. A row will be added to the first reel, which will then host 4 symbols instead of 3 in the following Respin. With another combination, the reel will expand to 5 rows, and so on, up to maximum 6. With 6 identical symbols, a x2 multiplier will be applied, increasing by 1 with each subsequent win. The Scatter symbol triggers the Free Spins round: 3, 4, 5, or 6 Scatters reward respectively with 6, 8, 10, and 12 Free Spins. Before starting the function, you are offered the opportunity to increase the spins, but be careful because the risk is to lose them all.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nCandyfinity has medium volatility and an RTP of 96%. The game's various multipliers and Respins increase the chances of obtaining high wins and rewards. With 6 identical symbols, a x2 multiplier will be applied, increasing by 1 with each subsequent win. The Scatter symbol triggers the Free Spins round: 3, 4, 5, or 6 Scatters reward respectively with 6, 8, 10, and 12 Free Spins.

The presence of two Scatters can also trigger or advance the game's Respin function.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nCandyfinity features an explosion of colors and shapes that will leave players feeling like they've entered a world of deliciousness. The game's symbols are three-dimensional, adding an extra layer of depth to the game's design. The background is a soft palette of icy white glaze, contrasted by bold, vibrant primary colors. The soundtrack is playful and upbeat, making for a lively and engaging gaming experience.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nIn Candyfinity, the playing card suits have a low value, while the watermelon, orange slice, blue candy, and red candy pay much higher. The Wild symbol acts as a Jolly, replacing any symbol except for the Scatter to complete incomplete combos. The Scatter symbol is represented by a gift box. Landing 3, 4, 5, or 6 Scatters rewards players with 6, 8, 10, and 12 Free Spins, respectively. Before starting the game's Free Spins function, players can increase the number of spins by purchasing 3 Scatters at a cost of 100 times the bet. Players can spend a sum equal to 500 times the bet to receive a maximum of 15 free spins.\n\nBetting Range\n\nCandyfinity has a minimum bet of €0.20, with an additional €0.10 required to activate the Golden Bet feature.

The background consists of soft roads and snow-capped peaks of white glaze, while the grid is made up of a cookie divided into squares, where our three-dimensional symbols will land. On the left, we find the counter that informs us about the number of ways to win, the value of the multiplier, the button to purchase the Bonus, and the golden bet, to be discussed later. At the bottom, we have the betting variance, the Autoplay button, and the Start button.\n\nCandyfinity has a fluid rotation mechanism without any hesitations, thanks to HTML5 technology, which also allows gameplay on mobile devices. The basic layout consists of 6 reels and 3 rows with 729 ways to win, although these numbers are destined to increase during the Bonus game.\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.20, but for an additional €0.10, the Golden Bet can be activated, increasing the chances of getting Bonus symbols. With the Autoplay function, you can choose to set between 10 and 1,000 automatic spins, although the game offers the possibility to have them go infinitely. If you opt for this solution, it is better to set the winning and losing limits that will stop the game once exceeded. Candyfinity has medium volatility and an RTP of 96%.\n\nThe game's interesting gameplay mechanism starts with every winning combination launching a special function, where the reels move to the right, and the winning symbols remain blocked. A row will be added to the first reel, which will then host 4 symbols instead of 3 in the following Respin. With another combination, the reel will expand to 5 rows, and so on, up to maximum 6. With 6 identical symbols, a x2 multiplier will be applied, increasing by 1 with each subsequent win. The arrival of two Scatters can also trigger or continue the function.\n\nLet's now look at the symbols in Candyfinity. The playing card suits have a low value, while the watermelon, orange slice, blue candy, and red candy pay much higher. The Wild symbol acts as a Jolly and concludes incomplete combos by replacing any symbol but not the Scatter. The Scatter symbol is represented by a gift box. 3, 4, 5, or 6 Scatters reward respectively with 6, 8, 10, and 12 Free Spins. Before starting the function, you are offered the opportunity to increase the spins, but be careful because the risk is to lose them all.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the theoretical return to player (RTP)?\n\nCandyfinity has an RTP of 96%.\n\nWhere can I find Candyfinity?\n\nThis game is available at all legal online casinos.\n\nHow can I get Free Spins?\n\nThere are two ways: the first is to hope that at least 3 Scatters land on the grid, the second is to purchase 3 Scatters at a cost of 100 times the bet. If you spend a sum equal to 500 times the bet, you will get the maximum of 15 free spins.\n            ",
