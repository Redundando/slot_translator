La trama di questo racconto tanto caro a grandi e piccini è ben nota: a Jack viene affidata una mucca ed è costretto dalla madre a venderla. Il ragazzo sulla via del mercato incontra un anziano che in cambio dell’animale gli offre un sacchetto di fagioli magici, la madre si infuria e getta i semi dalla finestra. Durante la notte nasce un’enorme pianta di fagioli e la mattina dopo, Jack si arrampica raggiungendo il castello del gigante. Jack riesce a rubare in tre giorni consecutivi un sacchetto di monete d’oro, una gallina dalle uova d’oro e un’arpa dorata.\nIn Megaways Jack ritroviamo tutti i simboli che hanno reso popolare la storia. Il comparto grafico è curato nei minimi dettagli, dietro la griglia di gioco si intravede la casa di Jack e ai lati della cornice si trovano l’arpa dorata e la pianta di fagioli, che avranno un ruolo importante nel gioco. Sulla parte superiori sono indicati i vari moltiplicatori, mentre nella parte bassa possiamo visualizzare il valore della puntata, le linee di pagamento attive, il tasto Giri Automatici e quello per la rotazione manuale.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nLa griglia di gioco è particolare, i rulli sono sei, ma le righe possono ospitare da due sino a sette simboli. La puntata minima è di 0,20 €, la massima di 20 €, mentre il ritorno teorico al giocatore o RTP è pari al 96,20%. Le linee di pagamento sono 20 e non possono essere modificate. Si può decidere di impostare un numero variabile di giri automatici, da un minimo di 20 a un massimo di 999.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Megaways Jack\nI simboli che pagano meno di tutti sono quelli legati alle carte, dal 10 all’Asso. A seguire troviamo la mucca, l’oca, la moglie del gigante, il gigante e Jack. La particolarità di questa slot è che a ogni combinazione vincente i relativi simboli scompaiono e ne cadono di nuovi a occupare quelle posizioni, creando nuove possibilità di vittoria. Il simbolo Wild è rappresentato dall’uovo d’oro e sostituisce tutti gli altri simboli in una combinazione vincente. Il simbolo fagiolo magico invece può comparire solo dopo la scomparsa di un altro simbolo e può far avanzare il Jack verso i giri gratuiti. Ma cosa vuol dire? Praticamente, ogni volta che si ha una vincita, una foglia sulla pianta diventa d’oro e se si hanno almeno 8 vincite, Jack scala la pianta e arriva al castello sulle nuvole, il che permetterà di attivare i giri gratuiti. Da 10 vittorie consecutive in poi, oltre ai giri gratuiti si avrà anche un moltiplicatore dal valore variabile. Se durante i giri gratuiti compaiono sette simboli identici su uno stesso rullo, essi rimarranno attivi sino all’esaurimento dei Free Spins, inoltre si avrà diritto a un ulteriore moltiplicatore. C’è poi la funzione dell’arpa, che agisce in modo casuale e può regalare spin gratuiti, Wild aggiuntivi, fino a cinque moltiplicatoru sulle vincite e un massimo di tre posizioni sulla pianta per raggiungere il castello.\n",

The symbols that pay the least are the card-related ones, followed by cow, goose, giant's wife, giant, and Jack. Every time there is a winning combination, the corresponding symbols disappear, and new ones fill those positions, creating new possibilities for winnings. The Wild symbol is represented by the golden egg and can substitute for all other symbols in a winning combination. The magic bean symbol only appears after the disappearance of another symbol and can advance Jack toward free spins. With all these features, Megaways Jack offers a thrilling experience for all.\n\nSymbols and paytable\n\nThe game features iconic symbols from the beloved tale of Jack, including the cow, goose, giant's wife, giant, and Jack himself. These symbols pay out more than the card-related ones. The Wild symbol is represented by the golden egg, which can substitute for all other symbols in a winning combination. The magic bean is another significant symbol that advances Jack toward free spins.\n\nBonus rounds and free spins\n\nMegaways Jack has a unique feature that allows Jack to climb the beanstalk to reach the castle, which activates free spins and multipliers. Every time you win, a leaf on the beanstalk turns golden. If you have at least eight wins, you can climb the beanstalk to reach the castle in the clouds, allowing you to activate free spins. From ten consecutive wins onwards, in addition to free spins, you also get a variable multiplier. If seven identical symbols appear on the same reel during free spins, they will remain active until the end, and you will receive an additional multiplier. The harp feature acts randomly and can offer free spins, additional Wilds, up to five multipliers on your winnings, and a maximum of three positions on the beanstalk to reach the castle.\n\nBetting and paylines\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.20, and the maximum is €20, making the game accessible to all types of players. Megaways Jack features 20 active paylines that cannot be modified, and you can choose to set a variable number of automatic spins from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 999. The theoretical return rate to the player or RTP is 96.20%, which is reasonable for an online slot game.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nMegaways Jack's graphics are stunning, with exceptional attention to detail. The game board displays Jack's house in the background while the golden harp and beanstalk frame the sides. The top displays the various multipliers, and at the bottom, you can see the betting value, active paylines, the Autoplay button, and the manual spin button. The symbols are exciting and beautiful, with each one contributing to the game's overall design. The overall design is modern, sleek, and inviting.\n\n        \n            ",

The story follows the beloved tale of Jack, who sells his beloved cow and acquires a sack of magic beans from an old man in return. When the beans are tossed out the window, a giant beanstalk grows overnight, leading Jack on a journey to the giant's castle where he steals gold coins, a golden hen, and a magical harp in three consecutive days.\n\nMegaways Jack features all the iconic symbols that have made this story a classic, with stunning graphics and attention to detail. The game board displays Jack's house in the background while the golden harp and beanstalk frame the sides. The top displays the various multipliers, and at the bottom, you can see the betting value, active paylines, the Autoplay button, and the manual spin button.\n\nThe game board is unique with six reels and rows that can hold two to seven symbols each. The minimum bet is €0.20, the maximum is €20, and the theoretical return rate to the player or RTP is 96.20%. There are 20 active paylines that cannot be modified. You can choose to set a variable number of automatic spins from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 999.\n\nSymbols and Features of Megaways Jack\n\nThe symbols that pay the least are the card-related ones from 10 to Ace. They are followed by the cow, goose, giant's wife, giant, and Jack. One of this slot's unique features is that every time there is a winning combination, the corresponding symbols disappear, and new ones fill those positions, creating new possibilities for winnings. The Wild symbol is represented by the golden egg and can substitute for all other symbols in a winning combination.\n\nThe magic bean symbol only appears after the disappearance of another symbol and can advance Jack toward free spins. Every time you win, a leaf on the beanstalk turns golden. If you have at least eight wins, Jack can climb the beanstalk to reach the castle in the clouds, allowing you to activate free spins. From ten consecutive wins onwards, in addition to free spins, you also get a variable multiplier. If seven identical symbols appear on the same reel during free spins, they will remain active until the end, and you will receive an additional multiplier.\n\nThe harp feature acts randomly and can offer free spins, additional Wilds, up to five multipliers on your winnings, and a maximum of three positions on the beanstalk to reach the castle. With all these features, Megaways Jack offers a thrilling gambling experience for experts and novice players alike.\n            ",
