            "response": "Dreamzone\n\nThe Dreamzone slot game is a Cluster Pays title from ELK Studios. Played on a 5x5 grid, you need to land adjacent symbols to form winning clusters. With cascading wins, you collect Dreamzone Features on each win, which you can use in non-winning Spins. With 4 of them to benefit from, they also come into play in the Bonus Drops feature, where each level gives you more free spins and doubles the multiplier, up to 512x.\n\nDreamzone features five horizontal and five vertical reels that can form win clusters with at least three symbols. The results of the wins are removed from the board, but only to be replaced by new symbols, which can themselves create clusters. The game has medium-high variance and a theoretical return to player of 96.00% - just average.\n\nA 3D and Precious Graphics\n\nRegarding the graphics, ELK Gaming's slot experts gave the game a spatial theme that takes place in a multidimensional world, which, of course, must appear in 3D for the sake of our mental health. The symbols are multi-angular crystal shapes, ranging from hearts to cones, stars and cubes.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot does a great job of entertaining our visual field. As wins are achieved, the structure of the symbols disintegrates and their molecular scaffold is cast into space, but not for long, because another set of symbols quickly materializes on the grid, to have a chance of producing another win. Another impressive detail is the sound theme, which is right up the alley of sci-fi enthusiasts.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot has a space-inspired theme and is described by the developer as a \"state beyond time and place\". With a dark outer space background, the bright and colorful neon symbols contrast sharply to bring the gameplay to life. The soundtrack is modern and will remind you a bit of NetEnt's Starburst.\n\nSymbols on the reels include low-value gems. High-value symbols appear in 3D with the red gem being the most valuable symbol. 11 or more in a winning cluster will translate into a payout of 100 x bets. The ‘W’ symbol is the wild symbol.\n\nWith ELK as the first mobile developer, Dreamzone can be played on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops as standard. The 5x5 grid looks quite good on smartphone screens.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nELK Studios has their controls and button layout replicated even in this game. On the right side of the reels are the Spin and Autoplay buttons. On the lower left, there is the coin stack button, and in the upper corner, the menu.\n\nPressing the rotation button once spins the reels once for the amount of the active bet. Players can press Spin for each turn or play the game in Autoplay mode. Pressing that button opens the menu where you can choose the number of automatic spins.\n\nOptional settings related to the above include adding conditions that stop automatic spins when they have been met, such as a single win that occurs or a total loss of balance.\n\nTo choose bets and play the Dreamzone slot, select the coin stack symbol. The betting range starts at 20 cents and ends at a maximum of €100.00 per spin. There are multiple amounts that allow players to choose a suitable bet.\n\nWins in this game are made with at least three symbols that are connected next to each other. When a win is made, the game triggers cascades. These can continue uninterrupted until there are new winning symbols. In addition, each cascade comes with a multiplier, but this is in the bonus function.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot has a wild symbol that can replace any of the standard symbols. In terms of values, there are two categories of symbols. The low-cost symbols are the small gems, five in number. Their values range from 0.1x to 0.3 for groups of three. 11 or more symbols can pay between 4.8x and 6x.\n\nThe symbols that pay the most are the larger crystals. The purple pays 0.4x and the red 1x for three. The most valuable symbol is the red object-shaped one, which pays 100x for 11 or more symbols.\n\nThe unique and surprising thing about this game is that even non-winning drops that are part of a cascade can continue the cascade. This is possible thanks to the Dream Features, which are collected together with the gameplay.\n\nThe said features are Wilds, to add up to five wilds; Symbol Explore that removes up to four symbols; Symbol Upgrade upgrades low winning symbols to their higher counterparts; and the scatter symbol that pays out scattered wins.\n\nBy removing all symbols from the grid, you get the free drop bonus feature. During this operation, each drop results in a 2x multiplier, and this figure is multiplied by 2x for each consecutive win. The maximum amount of multiplier that Dreamzone is capable of generating is 512x.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nEuphoria is iSoftbet's slot machine with multipliers, wilds, and a buy feature that gives you a bonus of free spins at a cost of 100x the active bet. The multipliers during the bonus can stack on top of the reels and multiply what is already there. This could lead to potentially huge wins for those lucky enough to get repeated star symbols.",

A sinistra, in basso c’è il pulsante delle pile di monete e nell’angolo superiore il menu.\nPremendo una volta il pulsante di rotazione, i rulli girano una volta per l’importo della puntata attiva. I giocatori possono premere Spin per ogni turno o giocare la partita in modalità Autoplay. Premendo quel pulsante si apre il menu in cui è possibile scegliere il numero di giri automatici.\nLe impostazioni opzionali relative a quanto sopra includono l’aggiunta di condizioni che fermano i rotazioni automatiche quando sono state soddisfatte, come ad esempio una singola vincita che si verifica o una perdita totale del saldo.\nPer scegliere le scommesse e giocare alla slot Dreamzone, selezionare il simbolo delle pile di monete. La gamma di scommesse inizia con 20 centesimi e termina con un massimo di €100.00 per giro. Ci sono importi multipli che permettono ai giocatori di scegliere una scommessa adeguata.\nLe vincite in questo gioco sono fatte con almeno tre simboli che sono collegati uno accanto all’altro. Quando viene effettuata una vincita, il gioco scatena delle valanghe. Queste possono continuare ininterrottamente finché ci sono nuovi simboli vincenti. Inoltre, ogni valanga viene fornita con un moltiplicatore, ma questo è nella funzione bonus.\nLa slot Dreamzone ha un simbolo jolly che può sostituire uno qualsiasi dei simboli standard. In termini di valori, ci sono due categorie di simboli. I simboli a basso costo sono le piccole gemme, cinque in numero. I loro valori variano tra 0,1x e 0,3 per i gruppi di tre. 11 o più simboli possono pagare tra 4,8x e 6x.\nI simboli che pagano di più sono i cristalli più grandi. Il viola paga 0,4x e il rosso 1x per tre. Il simbolo più prezioso è quello a forma di oggetto rosso, che paga 100x per 11 o più simboli.\nLa cosa unica e sorprendente di questo gioco è che anche le gocce non vincenti che fanno parte di una valanga possono far sì che la valanga continui. Questo è possibile grazie alle Caratteristiche del Sogno, che vengono raccolte insieme al gameplay.\nLe caratteristiche dette sono Wilds, per aggiungere fino a cinque wilds; Symbol Explore che rimuove fino a quattro simboli; Symbol Upgrade aggiorna i simboli delle vittorie basse ai corrispondenti alti; e il simbolo scatter che paga le vittorie sparse.\nRimuovendo tutti i simboli dalla griglia, si ottiene la funzione di bonus a gocce gratuite. Durante questa operazione, ogni goccia risulta in un moltiplicatore di 2x e questa cifra viene moltiplicata per 2x per ogni vittoria consecutiva. L’importo massimo del moltiplicatore che Dreamzone è in grado di generare è 512x.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nEuphoria è la Slot Machine di iSoftbet dotata di moltiplicatori, wilds e una funzione buy che ti dà un bonus di giri gratis al costo di 100x sulla scommessa attiva. I moltiplicatori durante il bonus possono impilare sopra i rulli e moltiplicano ciò che è già presente. Questo potrebbe portare a vittorie potenzialmente enormi per coloro che sono fortunati ad ottenere simboli stellari ripetuti.\n\n        ",

The symbols are multi-angled crystalline shapes, ranging from hearts to cones, stars, and cubes.\nThe Dreamzone slot is successful in entertaining our visual field. As you achieve wins, the structure of the symbols disintegrates, and their molecular scaffold is thrown into space, but not for long, because another set of symbols materializes quickly on the grid, giving you the chance to produce another win.

The 5x5 grid looks pretty good on smartphone screens.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nELK Studios has replicated its controls and button layout even with this game. On the right side of the reels, there are buttons for Spin and Autoplay. On the left, at the bottom, is the button for the coin stacks, and in the upper corner is the menu.\nPressing the spin button once spins the reels once for the active bet amount. Players can press Spin for every turn or play the game in Autoplay mode. Pressing that button opens the menu where you can choose the number of automatic spins.\nOptional settings related to the above include adding conditions that stop automatic spins when they have been satisfied, such as a single win that occurs or a total loss of the balance.\nTo choose bets and play the Dreamzone slot, select the coin stack symbol. The betting range starts at 20 cents and ends at a maximum of €100.00 per spin. There are multiple amounts that allow players to choose an appropriate bet.\nWins in this game are made with at least three symbols that are connected next to each other. When a win is made, the game triggers cascades. These can continue uninterrupted until there are new winning symbols. Additionally, each cascade comes with a multiplier, but this is in the bonus feature.\nThe Dreamzone slot has a wild symbol that can replace any of the standard symbols. In terms of values, there are two categories of symbols. The low-cost symbols are the small gems, five in number. Their values range from 0.1x to 0.3 for groups of three. 11 or more symbols can pay between 4.8x and 6x.\nThe highest paying symbols are the larger crystals.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay features\nVisuals and theme\nBonus features\nVariance and RTP\nSymbols and betting range\nAvailability on different devices\nWild symbol and symbol categories\nNon-winning drops and Dream Features\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Dreamzone\n\nThe Dreamzone slot game is a Cluster Pays title from ELK Studios. Played on a 5x5 grid, you need to land adjacent symbols to form winning clusters. With cascading wins, you collect Dreamzone Features on each win, which you can use in non-winning Spins. With 4 of them to benefit from, they also come into play in the Bonus Drops feature, where each level gives you more free spins and doubles the multiplier, up to 512x.\n\nDreamzone features five horizontal and five vertical reels that can form win clusters with at least three symbols. The results of the wins are removed from the board, but only to be replaced by new symbols, which can themselves create clusters. The game has medium-high variance and a theoretical return to player of 96.00% - just average.\n\nA 3D and Precious Graphics\n\nRegarding the graphics, ELK Gaming's slot experts gave the game a spatial theme that takes place in a multidimensional world, which, of course, must appear in 3D for the sake of our mental health. The symbols are multi-angular crystal shapes, ranging from hearts to cones, stars and cubes.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot does a great job of entertaining our visual field. As wins are achieved, the structure of the symbols disintegrates and their molecular scaffold is cast into space, but not for long, because another set of symbols quickly materializes on the grid, to have a chance of producing another win. Another impressive detail is the sound theme, which is right up the alley of sci-fi enthusiasts.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot has a space-inspired theme and is described by the developer as a \"state beyond time and place\". With a dark outer space background, the bright and colorful neon symbols contrast sharply to bring the gameplay to life. The soundtrack is modern and will remind you a bit of NetEnt's Starburst.\n\nSymbols on the reels include low-value gems. High-value symbols appear in 3D with the red gem being the most valuable symbol. 11 or more in a winning cluster will translate into a payout of 100 x bets. The ‘W’ symbol is the wild symbol.\n\nWith ELK as the first mobile developer, Dreamzone can be played on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops as standard. The 5x5 grid looks quite good on smartphone screens.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nELK Studios has their controls and button layout replicated even in this game. On the right side of the reels are the Spin and Autoplay buttons. On the lower left, there is the coin stack button, and in the upper corner, the menu.\n\nPressing the rotation button once spins the reels once for the amount of the active bet. Players can press Spin for each turn or play the game in Autoplay mode. Pressing that button opens the menu where you can choose the number of automatic spins.\n\nOptional settings related to the above include adding conditions that stop automatic spins when they have been met, such as a single win that occurs or a total loss of balance.\n\nTo choose bets and play the Dreamzone slot, select the coin stack symbol. The betting range starts at 20 cents and ends at a maximum of €100.00 per spin. There are multiple amounts that allow players to choose a suitable bet.\n\nWins in this game are made with at least three symbols that are connected next to each other. When a win is made, the game triggers cascades. These can continue uninterrupted until there are new winning symbols. In addition, each cascade comes with a multiplier, but this is in the bonus function.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot has a wild symbol that can replace any of the standard symbols. In terms of values, there are two categories of symbols. The low-cost symbols are the small gems, five in number. Their values range from 0.1x to 0.3 for groups of three. 11 or more symbols can pay between 4.8x and 6x.\n\nThe symbols that pay the most are the larger crystals. The purple pays 0.4x and the red 1x for three. The most valuable symbol is the red object-shaped one, which pays 100x for 11 or more symbols.\n\nThe unique and surprising thing about this game is that even non-winning drops that are part of a cascade can continue the cascade. This is possible thanks to the Dream Features, which are collected together with the gameplay.\n\nThe said features are Wilds, to add up to five wilds; Symbol Explore that removes up to four symbols; Symbol Upgrade upgrades low winning symbols to their higher counterparts; and the scatter symbol that pays out scattered wins.\n\nBy removing all symbols from the grid, you get the free drop bonus feature. During this operation, each drop results in a 2x multiplier, and this figure is multiplied by 2x for each consecutive win. The maximum amount of multiplier that Dreamzone is capable of generating is 512x.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nEuphoria is iSoftbet's slot machine with multipliers, wilds, and a buy feature that gives you a bonus of free spins at a cost of 100x the active bet. The multipliers during the bonus can stack on top of the reels and multiply what is already there. This could lead to potentially huge wins for those lucky enough to get repeated star symbols.\n            ",

You need to land adjacent symbols to form winning clusters. With cascading wins, you collect Dreamzone Features on each win, which you can use in non-winning Spins. With 4 of them to benefit from, they also come into play in the Bonus Drops feature, where each level gives you more free spins and doubles the multiplier, up to 512x.\n\nVisuals and Theme\n\nDreamzone has a space-inspired theme and is described by the developer as a 'state beyond time and place'. With a dark outer space background, the bright and colorful neon symbols contrast sharply to bring the gameplay to life. The sound theme is reminiscent of sci-fi, and the symbols are multi-angular crystal shapes, ranging from hearts to cones, stars, and cubes. The game is designed in 3D with precious graphics that entertain our visual field.\n\nBonus Features\n\nDreamzone has a Free Drop Bonus feature, which is triggered when all symbols are removed from the grid. During this feature, each drop results in a 2x multiplier, and this figure is multiplied by 2x for each consecutive win. The maximum amount of multiplier that Dreamzone is capable of generating is 512x. The game also has four Dream Features that are collected together with the gameplay: Wilds, Symbol Explore, Symbol Upgrade, and Scatter symbol.\n\nVariance and RTP\n\nDreamzone has a medium-high variance and a theoretical return to player of 96.00% - just average.\n\nSymbols and Betting Range\n\nSymbols on the reels include low-value gems. High-value symbols appear in 3D with the red gem being the most valuable symbol. Players can choose bets and play the Dreamzone slot by selecting the coin stack symbol. The betting range starts at 20 cents and ends at a maximum of €100.00 per spin.\n\nAvailability on Different Devices\n\nDreamzone can be played on mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers.\n\nWild Symbol and Symbol Categories\n\nThe 'W' symbol in Dreamzone is the game's wild symbol that can replace any of the standard symbols. In terms of values, there are two categories of symbols. The low-cost symbols are the small gems, and five are available in number. Their values range from 0.1x to 0.3 for groups of three. 11 or more symbols can pay between 4.8x and 6x. The symbols that pay the most are the larger crystals. The purple pays 0.4x and the red 1x for three. The most valuable symbol is the red object-shaped one, which pays 100x for 11 or more symbols.\n\nNon-Winning Drops and Dream Features\n\nEven non-winning drops that are part of a cascade in Dreamzone can continue the cascade. This is possible thanks to the Dream Features, which are collected together with the gameplay. The features are Wilds, Symbol Explore, Symbol Upgrade, and the Scatter symbol that pays out scattered wins.\n\n        \n            ",

With cascading wins, players can collect Dreamzone Features on each win and use them in non-winning spins. Aside from a standard wild feature, Dreamzone has four Dream Features, which are Wilds, Symbol Explore, Symbol Upgrade, and Scatter symbol. These unique features add an extra layer of excitement to every spin.\n\nVisuals and Soundtrack\n\nELK Studios did a great job with the visuals and soundtrack of Dreamzone. The game has a space-inspired theme with a dark outer space background and bright and colorful neon symbols that contrast sharply to bring the gameplay to life. The symbols are multi-angular crystal shapes, ranging from hearts to cones, stars and cubes, all cast into space in 3D with impressive visual effects. The soundtrack is modern and sci-fi themed, which perfectly complements the graphics and overall theme.\n\nBonus Features\n\nDreamzone has a Free Drops bonus feature, which is triggered by removing all symbols from the grid. During this feature, each drop results in a 2x multiplier, and this figure is multiplied by 2x for each consecutive win. The maximum amount of multiplier that Dreamzone is capable of generating is 512x. In addition to the Free Drops feature, Dreamzone also has the Bonus Drops feature, where each level gives players more free spins and doubles the multiplier. With four Dream Features, Wilds, Symbol Explore, Symbol Upgrade, and Scatter symbol, players have more chances of winning big.\n\nCompatibility\n\nAs one of the first mobile-first developers, ELK Studios ensures that Dreamzone is compatible with all devices, including mobiles and tablets. The 5x5 grid looks good on smartphone screens, and players can enjoy Dreamzone on their preferred device without sacrificing gameplay quality.\n\nVariance and RTP\n\nDreamzone has medium-high variance and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.00%, which is average in the industry. This means players can expect to win frequently enough, and with a max win of up to 2,500x, there's a chance to land some big wins.\n\nSymbols and Values\n\nThe symbols in Dreamzone are crystal shapes, with the red gem being the most valuable symbol. Low-value symbols are the small gems, and five of them have values ranging from 0.1x to 0.3x for groups of three. 11 or more symbols can pay between 4.8x and 6x. The symbols that pay the most are the larger crystals, and the red, object-shaped one is the most valuable symbol, which pays 100x for 11 or more symbols. The 'W' symbol is the wild symbol and can replace any of the standard symbols.\n\nDreamzone Features\n\nOne of Dreamzone's unique features is the Dream Features. These are collected along with the gameplay and can be used in non-winning spins. The Wilds feature adds up to five wilds, which can increase the chances of creating winning clusters. Symbol Explore removes up to four symbols from the grid, increasing the chances of creating new clusters. Symbol Upgrade upgrades low-value symbols to their higher counterparts, which can increase the payout. Scatter symbol pays out scattered wins, increasing the Total Payout of each spin.\n\nBetting Range\n\nTo choose bets and play the Dreamzone slot, select the coin stack symbol. The betting range starts at 20 cents and ends at a maximum of €100.00 per spin, giving players multiple amounts to choose a suitable bet. Optional settings allow players to add conditions that stop automatic spins when certain criteria are met, such as a single win or a total loss of balance.\n\n        \n            ",

Played on a 5x5 grid, you need to land adjacent symbols to form winning clusters. With cascading wins, you collect Dreamzone Features on each win, which you can use in non-winning Spins. With 4 of them to benefit from, they also come into play in the Bonus Drops feature, where each level gives you more free spins and doubles the multiplier, up to 512x.\n\nDreamzone features five horizontal and five vertical reels that can form win clusters with at least three symbols. The results of the wins are removed from the board, but only to be replaced by new symbols, which can themselves create clusters. The game has medium-high variance and a theoretical return to player of 96.00% - just average.\n\nA 3D and Precious Graphics\n\nRegarding the graphics, ELK Gaming's slot experts gave the game a spatial theme that takes place in a multidimensional world, which, of course, must appear in 3D for the sake of our mental health. The symbols are multi-angular crystal shapes, ranging from hearts to cones, stars and cubes.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot does a great job of entertaining our visual field. As wins are achieved, the structure of the symbols disintegrates and their molecular scaffold is cast into space, but not for long, because another set of symbols quickly materializes on the grid, to have a chance of producing another win. Another impressive detail is the sound theme, which is right up the alley of sci-fi enthusiasts.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot has a space-inspired theme and is described by the developer as a \"state beyond time and place\". With a dark outer space background, the bright and colorful neon symbols contrast sharply to bring the gameplay to life. The soundtrack is modern and will remind you a bit of NetEnt's Starburst.\n\nSymbols on the reels include low-value gems. High-value symbols appear in 3D with the red gem being the most valuable symbol. 11 or more in a winning cluster will translate into a payout of 100 x bets. The ‘W’ symbol is the wild symbol.\n\nWith ELK as the first mobile developer, Dreamzone can be played on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops as standard. The 5x5 grid looks quite good on smartphone screens.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nELK Studios has their controls and button layout replicated even in this game. On the right side of the reels are the Spin and Autoplay buttons. On the lower left, there is the coin stack button, and in the upper corner, the menu.\n\nPressing the rotation button once spins the reels once for the amount of the active bet. Players can press Spin for each turn or play the game in Autoplay mode. Pressing that button opens the menu where you can choose the number of automatic spins.\n\nOptional settings related to the above include adding conditions that stop automatic spins when they have been met, such as a single win that occurs or a total loss of balance.\n\nTo choose bets and play the Dreamzone slot, select the coin stack symbol. The betting range starts at 20 cents and ends at a maximum of €100.00 per spin. There are multiple amounts that allow players to choose a suitable bet.\n\nWins in this game are made with at least three symbols that are connected next to each other. When a win is made, the game triggers cascades. These can continue uninterrupted until there are new winning symbols. In addition, each cascade comes with a multiplier, but this is in the bonus function.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot has a wild symbol that can replace any of the standard symbols. In terms of values, there are two categories of symbols. The low-cost symbols are the small gems, five in number. Their values range from 0.1x to 0.3 for groups of three. 11 or more symbols can pay between 4.8x and 6x.\n\nThe symbols that pay the most are the larger crystals. The purple pays 0.4x and the red 1x for three. The most valuable symbol is the red object-shaped one, which pays 100x for 11 or more symbols.\n\nThe unique and surprising thing about this game is that even non-winning drops that are part of a cascade can continue the cascade. This is possible thanks to the Dream Features, which are collected together with the gameplay.\n\nThe said features are Wilds, to add up to five wilds; Symbol Explore that removes up to four symbols; Symbol Upgrade upgrades low winning symbols to their higher counterparts; and the scatter symbol that pays out scattered wins.\n\nBy removing all symbols from the grid, you get the free drop bonus feature. During this operation, each drop results in a 2x multiplier, and this figure is multiplied by 2x for each consecutive win. The maximum amount of multiplier that Dreamzone is capable of generating is 512x.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nEuphoria is iSoftbet's slot machine with multipliers, wilds, and a buy feature that gives you a bonus of free spins at a cost of 100x the active bet. The multipliers during the bonus can stack on top of the reels and multiply what is already there. This could lead to potentially huge wins for those lucky enough to get repeated star symbols.\n            ",

Played on a 5x5 grid, you need to land adjacent symbols to form winning clusters. With cascading wins, you collect Dreamzone Features on each win, which you can use in non-winning Spins. With 4 of them to benefit from, they also come into play in the Bonus Drops feature, where each level gives you more free spins and doubles the multiplier, up to 512x.\n\nDreamzone features five horizontal and five vertical reels that can form win clusters with at least three symbols. The results of the wins are removed from the board, but only to be replaced by new symbols, which can themselves create clusters. The game has medium-high variance and a theoretical return to player of 96.00% - just average.\n\nA 3D and Precious Graphics\n\nRegarding the graphics, ELK Gaming's slot experts gave the game a spatial theme that takes place in a multidimensional world, which, of course, must appear in 3D for the sake of our mental health. The symbols are multi-angular crystal shapes, ranging from hearts to cones, stars and cubes.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot does a great job of entertaining our visual field. As wins are achieved, the structure of the symbols disintegrates and their molecular scaffold is cast into space, but not for long, because another set of symbols quickly materializes on the grid, to have a chance of producing another win. Another impressive detail is the sound theme, which is right up the alley of sci-fi enthusiasts.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot has a space-inspired theme and is described by the developer as a \"state beyond time and place\". With a dark outer space background, the bright and colorful neon symbols contrast sharply to bring the gameplay to life. The soundtrack is modern and will remind you a bit of NetEnt's Starburst.\n\nSymbols on the reels include low-value gems. High-value symbols appear in 3D with the red gem being the most valuable symbol. 11 or more in a winning cluster will translate into a payout of 100 x bets. The ‘W’ symbol is the wild symbol.\n\nWith ELK as the first mobile developer, Dreamzone can be played on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops as standard. The 5x5 grid looks quite good on smartphone screens.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nELK Studios has their controls and button layout replicated even in this game. On the right side of the reels are the Spin and Autoplay buttons. On the lower left, there is the coin stack button, and in the upper corner, the menu.\n\nPressing the rotation button once spins the reels once for the amount of the active bet. Players can press Spin for each turn or play the game in Autoplay mode. Pressing that button opens the menu where you can choose the number of automatic spins.\n\nOptional settings related to the above include adding conditions that stop automatic spins when they have been met, such as a single win that occurs or a total loss of balance.\n\nTo choose bets and play the Dreamzone slot, select the coin stack symbol. The betting range starts at 20 cents and ends at a maximum of €100.00 per spin. There are multiple amounts that allow players to choose a suitable bet.\n\nWins in this game are made with at least three symbols that are connected next to each other. When a win is made, the game triggers cascades. These can continue uninterrupted until there are new winning symbols. In addition, each cascade comes with a multiplier, but this is in the bonus function.\n\nThe Dreamzone slot has a wild symbol that can replace any of the standard symbols. In terms of values, there are two categories of symbols. The low-cost symbols are the small gems, five in number. Their values range from 0.1x to 0.3 for groups of three. 11 or more symbols can pay between 4.8x and 6x.\n\nThe symbols that pay the most are the larger crystals. The purple pays 0.4x and the red 1x for three. The most valuable symbol is the red object-shaped one, which pays 100x for 11 or more symbols.\n\nThe unique and surprising thing about this game is that even non-winning drops that are part of a cascade can continue the cascade. This is possible thanks to the Dream Features, which are collected together with the gameplay.\n\nThe said features are Wilds, to add up to five wilds; Symbol Explore that removes up to four symbols; Symbol Upgrade upgrades low winning symbols to their higher counterparts; and the scatter symbol that pays out scattered wins.\n\nBy removing all symbols from the grid, you get the free drop bonus feature. During this operation, each drop results in a 2x multiplier, and this figure is multiplied by 2x for each consecutive win. The maximum amount of multiplier that Dreamzone is capable of generating is 512x.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nEuphoria is iSoftbet's slot machine with multipliers, wilds, and a buy feature that gives you a bonus of free spins at a cost of 100x the active bet. The multipliers during the bonus can stack on top of the reels and multiply what is already there. This could lead to potentially huge wins for those lucky enough to get repeated star symbols.\n            ",
