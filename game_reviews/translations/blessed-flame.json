It's like attending a fancy dress party with every single character in a book. The symbols at the low end of the pay scale will be instantly recognizable to card players, the typical spades, flowers, hearts and diamonds. However, in this game, they are magically imbued, which is much fancier than your average deck of cards. </p>\n\n  <p>The medium-value symbols are said to be giants, although I've always been unsure about the difference between a giant and a really, really big person. Either way, Nyarlathotep, Hastur and Cthulhu have been given the honor of being medium-paying symbols in this game. The high-paying symbols, as expected, are the gods themselves: Hercules, Athena and Zeus. I was deeply disappointed to find out that the gods don't show up in thunderbolts or on clouds, but instead are just regular symbols with fancy graphics.</p>\n\n  <p>The game doesn't have a permanent wild, but it does have something almost as good: any Olympic or Giant symbol can temporarily act as a wild during free spins and bonus rounds. If only I could be temporarily wild in real life, like on the weekends! On a more serious note, this feature can be a real advantage for players.
