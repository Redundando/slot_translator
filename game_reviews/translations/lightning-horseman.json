Basata sul classico racconto di Sleepy Hollow, la video slot Lightning Horseman è ambientata in una cittadina americana terrorizzata da un demone a cavallo di un cavallo nero e accompagnata da una zucca luminosa. Forzieri del tesoro, corvi e ponti coperti si uniscono ai personaggi di Katrina Van Tassel e Ichabod Crane in questa slot a cinque rulli e 40 linee che proviene da Lightning Box Games. In un lampo di ispirazione, gli sviluppatori hanno dato a un fulmine il potere di innescare giri liberi dove le vincite sono garantite. Il punto sui jackpot assegnati alla fine di Lightning Respins o Flippin Retrigger Feature è corretto.\nCon il Cavaliere come simbolo wild ad alto rendimento, e dandovi la possibilità di richiedere grandi jackpot durante i giri bonus, questa slot machine può essere giocata per scommesse in denaro reale di soli 0,40€ per giro. Si può godere di tutta l’azione macabra sui PC desktop, oltre a poter far girare i rulli su iPhone, iPad, e altri dispositivi mobili alimentati da Windows e Android. Lighting Box Games ha sede a Sydney, Australia. Potrebbe non essere il più noto sviluppatore di slot online e mobile ottimizzati, ma questo è in parte dovuto al fatto che produce molti giochi per altri sviluppatori. Hits come Dolphin’s Gold, Super Happy Fortune Cat e Lost Temple sono in realtà slot che sono stati sviluppati da Lightning Box Games ma rilasciati da aziende partner.\nUna grafica spaventosa\nLa Leggenda di Sleepy Hollow è stata raccontata molte volte in passato, ma ecco un rapido riassunto. Ichabod Crane è il maestro del villaggio. Una notte, incontra il fantasma di un soldato dell’Assia che ha perso la testa a causa di una palla di cannone. Segue un inseguimento verso un ponte coperto, dove Crane e il cavaliere spariscono in un lampo di fuoco e zolfo. Raccontata nel film di Tim Burton del 1999 e nelle serie televisive, è una storia classica e duratura che è diventata particolarmente popolare intorno ad Halloween.\nTorniamo al presente e diamo un’occhiata alla postazione video di Lightning Horseman. Tutti gli elementi essenziali della storia sono stati sapientemente intrecciati nei rulli. Tra questi, un’immagine di sfondo della città, alberi contorti della foresta circostante e una colonna sonora in stile gotico che sicuramente vi farà venire i brividi. Ha un aspetto magnifico, anche se la grafica è forse un po’ datata.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nIl Cavaliere, senza testa ma con una zucca scolpita in mano, sarà la vostra caratteristica wild e il simbolo che paga di più i clienti abituali (600 volte la scommessa della linea). Il ruolo abituale in cui lo vedrete apparire sarà quello del sostituto, e in questa veste vi aiuterà di più. Può essere utile anche se appare una sola volta, ma non fa niente per voi se è lo scatter che deve essere sostituito. Anche gli scatters Lightning Bolt possono apparire, e possono farlo anche su più posizioni su ogni bobina. Si finisce per avere bisogno di almeno 6 di questi scatter per innescare un Lightning Respin, anche se ben 13 possono agire in questa funzione. La funzione Lightning Respin vi dà 3 colpi all’inizio, con gli scatters innescanti bloccati per tutta la durata. Solo le altre posizioni girano. L’obiettivo è quello di ottenere dei Lightning Bolts extra, in modo che possano anche bloccarsi in posizione e resettare il numero di respin a 3. Alla fine della funzione, i Lightning Bolts si girano e vi danno dei premi.\nSe si riesce a riempire le bobine con 15 Lightning Bolts, allora si ottiene il Flippin Retrigger. Si capovolgono tutti i Lightning Bolts, e si ottengono premi da tutti.\nIl simbolo del fulmine non vale niente di per sé, ma ha alcuni talenti molto speciali che portano ad alcune caratteristiche premianti. Se si vedono da sei a 13 fulmini contemporaneamente in qualsiasi luogo, si attiva la funzione Lightning Respin. All’inizio si effettuano solo tre giri liberi, con tutti i fulmini bloccati. Se compaiono altri fulmini, anche questi rimarranno al loro posto, e si effettuano altri tre giri gratuiti. Questo continua ad accumulare il totale dei simboli dei fulmini fino a quando si ottengono tre rotazioni senza che appaiano altri simboli, o fino a quando tutte e 15 le posizioni sulle bobine sono state occupate con questi simboli. Alla fine del giro, tutti i fulmini si capovolgono per rivelare i premi. Anche se non tutti avranno alcun valore, è garantito che si otterranno almeno alcune vincite dalla funzione Lightning Respins. Questo cambia se tutte e 15 le posizioni delle bobine sono state riempite dal Lightning Bolt, in quanto la funzione Flippin’ Retrigger assicura che tutti i simboli abbiano un valore. Alla fine di Lightning Respins, durante la funzione Flippin’ Retrigger, potresti essere premiato a caso con un premio Mini, Minor, Major o Grand jackpot. Questi non sono jackpot progressivi, ma possono comunque valere somme consistenti. A livelli di scommessa più alti, le probabilità di ottenere un jackpot – così come la dimensione dei premi – saliranno.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nLa video slot Haunted Horseman di High 5 Games si basa sulla stessa storia. È un gioco a cinque rulli con 99 linee di pagamento regolabili, in cui sono presenti Ichabod, Katrina, Zucche e il Cavaliere Assassino. Ha un sistema Tumbling Reels, dove tutti i simboli che fanno parte di una combinazione vincente spariscono per essere sostituiti da nuovi che cadono dall’alto. Se questo crea nuove vittorie, allora le bobine cadranno di nuovo più e più volte fino a quando non si verificherà una caduta non vincente. Anche i giri liberi e le sostituzioni wild sono presenti in questa spaventosa slot machine.\n",

Based on the classic tale of Sleepy Hollow, Lightning Horseman is set in an American town haunted by a demon on a black horse and accompanied by a glowing pumpkin. With treasure chests, crows, covered bridges, and the characters of Katrina Van Tassel and Ichabod Crane, this five-reel, 40-line slot from Lightning Box Games features cutting-edge features, including the power of lightning to trigger free spins for guaranteed winnings. And with the Knight as the high-earning wild symbol, this slot offers players the opportunity to win big jackpots during bonus rounds, all for bets as low as 0.40€ per spin. Enjoy all the macabre action on desktop PCs and mobile devices powered by Windows and Android, and get ready for a gaming experience that will leave you electrified.\n\nA Terrifying Visual Experience\n\nThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow has been told many times before, but in Lightning Horseman online slot, all of the story's essential elements have been expertly woven into the reels. The background features an image of the town, contorted trees in the surrounding forest, and a gothic-style soundtrack that will surely send chills down your spine. The game looks fantastic, but the graphics may be a bit dated for some players.\n\nFeatures and Symbols\n\nThe Headless Knight, holding a carved pumpkin, serves as your wild feature and the highest-paying regular symbol (600 times the line bet). Its usual role is as a substitute, and in this guise, it is most helpful. It can be useful even if it appears only once, but it doesn't do anything for you if it's the scatter that needs to be replaced. Lightning Bolt scatters can also appear and can do so on multiple positions on each reel. You'll need at least six of these scatters to trigger a Lightning Respin, although as many as 13 can act in this feature. The Lightning Respin feature gives you three hits at the outset, with the triggering scatters frozen in place throughout. Only the other positions spin. The goal is to land extra Lightning Bolts so that they, too, can freeze in place and reset the number of respins to three. At the end of the feature, the Lightning Bolts flip over to reveal the prizes.\n\nIf you manage to fill the reels with 15 Lightning Bolts, you get the Flippin Retrigger feature. All the Lightning Bolts are flipped over, and you get prizes from all of them.\n\nThe Lightning Bolt symbol is worthless by itself, but it has some very special talents that lead to some rewarding features. If you see six to 13 Lightning Bolt symbols at once anywhere, you trigger the Lightning Respin feature. At the outset, you get only three free spins, with all the Lightning Bolts frozen. If more Lightning Bolts appear, they too will be frozen in place, and you get another set of three free spins. This continues to pile up the total number of Lightning Bolt symbols until you get three spins without any more appearing or until all 15 positions on the reels are filled with these symbols. At the end of the round, all the Lightning Bolts are flipped over to reveal prize values. Although not all will have value, it is guaranteed that you'll get at least some winnings from the Lightning Respin feature. This changes if all 15 positions on the reels are filled with Lightning Bolts as the Flippin Retrigger feature ensures that all the symbols have a value. At the end of the Lightning Respin feature, during the Flippin Retrigger feature, you may be randomly awarded a Mini, Minor, Major, or Grand jackpot prize. Although these are not progressive jackpots, they can still be worth substantial sums. For higher bet levels, the odds of winning a jackpot—and the size of the prizes—will increase.\n\nSimilar Online Slots\n\nIf you like the spooky theme of this online slot, then you might also want to check out High 5 Games' Haunted Horseman online slot, which is based on the same story. It's a five-reel slot with 99 adjustable paylines that features Ichabod, Katrina, Pumpkins, and the Killer Knight. It has a Tumbling Reels system, where all symbols involved in a winning combination disappear to be replaced by new symbols that drop from above. If this creates new wins, then the reels will drop again and again until a non-winning drop occurs. Free spins and wild substitutions are also featured in this spooky slot game.",

Treasure chests, crows, and covered bridges come together with Katrina Van Tassel and Ichabod Crane in this Lightning Box Games creation. With a flash of inspiration, developers have empowered lightning to trigger free spins where wins are guaranteed. The point on jackpots awarded following Lightning Respins or Flippin Retrigger Feature is correct.\nWith the headless rider as the high-paying wild symbol, offering you the chance to claim big jackpots during bonus spins, this slot machine can be played for real money bets for as little as €0.40 per spin. You can enjoy all the macabre action on desktop PCs, as well as on iPhones, iPads, and other Windows- and Android-powered mobile devices. Lightning Box Games is based in Sydney, Australia. It may not be the most well-known developer of online and mobile-optimized slots, but that is partly due to the fact that it produces many games for other developers. Hits such as Dolphin's Gold, Super Happy Fortune Cat, and Lost Temple are actually slots that have been developed by Lightning Box Games but released by partner companies.\nEerie graphics\nThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow has been told many times in the past, but here's a quick summary. Ichabod Crane is the schoolmaster of the village. One night, he encounters the ghost of a Hessian soldier who lost his head due to a cannonball. This is followed by a chase to a covered bridge, where Crane and the rider disappear in a flash of fire and sulfur. Told in Tim Burton's 1999 film and in TV series, it's a classic and enduring story that became particularly popular around Halloween.\nLet's return to the present and take a look at the Lightning Horseman video slot station. All the essential elements of the story have been cleverly woven into the reels. Among them, a background image of the town, twisted trees of the surrounding forest, and a gothic soundtrack that is sure to give you chills. It looks magnificent, although the graphics are perhaps a bit dated.\nSlot machine functions and symbols\nThe headless rider, with a carved pumpkin in hand, will be your wild feature and the symbol paying the highest to regular customers (600 times the line bet). The usual role in which you will see him appear will be that of substitute, and in this role he will help you the most. It can still help even if it appears only once, but it does nothing for you if it is the scatter that needs to be replaced. Lightning Bolt scatters can also appear, and they can do so on multiple positions on each reel. You end up needing at least 6 of these scatters to trigger a Lightning Respin, although as many as 13 can act in this feature. The Lightning Respin feature gives you 3 shots at the start, with the triggering scatters locked in place for the duration. Only the other positions spin. The goal is to get extra Lightning Bolts, so that they too can lock in place and reset the number of respins to 3. At the end of the feature, the Lightning Bolts flip over and give you prizes.\nIf you manage to fill the reels with 15 Lightning Bolts, then you get the Flippin Retrigger. All Lightning Bolts are flipped over and you receive prizes from them all.\nThe lightning bolt symbol is worth nothing on its own, but it has some very special talents that lead to some rewarding features. If you see six to 13 lightning bolts simultaneously anywhere, the Lightning Respin feature is activated. At the beginning, you get only three free spins, with all the lightning bolts locked in. If more lightning bolts appear, they too will stay in place, and you get another three free spins. This continues to accumulate the total symbol of lightning bolts until you get three rotations without any more symbols appearing, or until all 15 positions on the reels are occupied with these symbols. At the end of the spin, all the Lightning Bolts flip over to reveal prizes. Although not all of them will have any value, it is guaranteed that you will get at least some wins from the Lightning Respins feature. This changes if all 15 positions on the reels are filled with the Lightning Bolt, as the Flippin' Retrigger feature ensures that all symbols have a value. At the end of the Lightning Respins feature, during the Flippin' Retrigger feature you may be randomly awarded a Mini, Minor, Major, or Grand jackpot prize. These are not progressive jackpots, but they can still be worth sizable sums. At higher bet levels, the chances of hitting a jackpot - as well as the prize size - will rise.\nOther similar slot machines\nHigh 5 Games' Haunted Horseman video slot is based on the same story. It is a 5-reel game with 99 adjustable paylines, featuring Ichabod, Katrina, Pumpkins, and the Killer Rider.

Questo cambia se tutte e 15 le posizioni delle bobine sono state riempite dal Lightning Bolt, in quanto la funzione Flippin’ Retrigger assicura che tutti i simboli abbiano un valore. Alla fine di Lightning Respins, durante la funzione Flippin’ Retrigger, potresti essere premiato a caso con un premio Mini, Minor, Major o Grand jackpot. Questi non sono jackpot progressivi, ma possono comunque valere somme consistenti. A livelli di scommessa più alti, le probabilità di ottenere un jackpot – così come la dimensione dei premi – saliranno.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nLa video slot Haunted Horseman di High 5 Games si basa sulla stessa storia. È un gioco a cinque rulli con 99 linee di pagamento regolabili, in cui sono presenti Ichabod, Katrina, Zucche e il Cavaliere Assassino. Ha un sistema Tumbling Reels, dove tutti i simboli che fanno parte di una combinazione vincente spariscono per essere sostituiti da nuovi che cadono dall’alto. Se questo crea nuove vittorie, allora le bobine cadranno di nuovo più e più volte fino a quando non si verificherà una caduta non vincente. Anche i giri liberi e le sostituzioni wild sono presenti in questa spaventosa slot machine.\n\n        ",

                            "content": "Get ready to face the terrifying Headless Horseman in the thrilling slot game Lightning Horseman, featuring cutting-edge features. Based on the classic tale of Sleepy Hollow, this 5-reel and 40-line video slot is set in an American town haunted by a demon riding a black horse and accompanied by a glowing pumpkin. Treasure chests, crows, and covered bridges come together with Katrina Van Tassel and Ichabod Crane in this Lightning Box Games creation. With a flash of inspiration, developers have empowered lightning to trigger free spins where wins are guaranteed. The point on jackpots awarded following Lightning Respins or Flippin Retrigger Feature is correct.\nWith the headless rider as the high-paying wild symbol, offering you the chance to claim big jackpots during bonus spins, this slot machine can be played for real money bets for as little as €0.40 per spin. You can enjoy all the macabre action on desktop PCs, as well as on iPhones, iPads, and other Windows- and Android-powered mobile devices. Lightning Box Games is based in Sydney, Australia. It may not be the most well-known developer of online and mobile-optimized slots, but that is partly due to the fact that it produces many games for other developers. Hits such as Dolphin's Gold, Super Happy Fortune Cat, and Lost Temple are actually slots that have been developed by Lightning Box Games but released by partner companies.\nEerie graphics\nThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow has been told many times in the past, but here's a quick summary. Ichabod Crane is the schoolmaster of the village. One night, he encounters the ghost of a Hessian soldier who lost his head due to a cannonball. This is followed by a chase to a covered bridge, where Crane and the rider disappear in a flash of fire and sulfur. Told in Tim Burton's 1999 film and in TV series, it's a classic and enduring story that became particularly popular around Halloween.\nLet's return to the present and take a look at the Lightning Horseman video slot station. All the essential elements of the story have been cleverly woven into the reels. Among them, a background image of the town, twisted trees of the surrounding forest, and a gothic soundtrack that is sure to give you chills. It looks magnificent, although the graphics are perhaps a bit dated.\nSlot machine functions and symbols\nThe headless rider, with a carved pumpkin in hand, will be your wild feature and the symbol paying the highest to regular customers (600 times the line bet). The usual role in which you will see him appear will be that of substitute, and in this role he will help you the most. It can still help even if it appears only once, but it does nothing for you if it is the scatter that needs to be replaced. Lightning Bolt scatters can also appear, and they can do so on multiple positions on each reel. You end up needing at least 6 of these scatters to trigger a Lightning Respin, although as many as 13 can act in this feature. The Lightning Respin feature gives you 3 shots at the start, with the triggering scatters locked in place for the duration. Only the other positions spin. The goal is to get extra Lightning Bolts, so that they too can lock in place and reset the number of respins to 3. At the end of the feature, the Lightning Bolts flip over and give you prizes.\nIf you manage to fill the reels with 15 Lightning Bolts, then you get the Flippin Retrigger. All Lightning Bolts are flipped over and you receive prizes from them all.\nThe lightning bolt symbol is worth nothing on its own, but it has some very special talents that lead to some rewarding features. If you see six to 13 lightning bolts simultaneously anywhere, the Lightning Respin feature is activated. At the beginning, you get only three free spins, with all the lightning bolts locked in. If more lightning bolts appear, they too will stay in place, and you get another three free spins. This continues to accumulate the total symbol of lightning bolts until you get three rotations without any more symbols appearing, or until all 15 positions on the reels are occupied with these symbols. At the end of the spin, all the Lightning Bolts flip over to reveal prizes. Although not all of them will have any value, it is guaranteed that you will get at least some wins from the Lightning Respins feature. This changes if all 15 positions on the reels are filled with the Lightning Bolt, as the Flippin' Retrigger feature ensures that all symbols have a value. At the end of the Lightning Respins feature, during the Flippin' Retrigger feature you may be randomly awarded a Mini, Minor, Major, or Grand jackpot prize. These are not progressive jackpots, but they can still be worth sizable sums. At higher bet levels, the chances of hitting a jackpot - as well as the prize size - will rise.\nOther similar slot machines\nHigh 5 Games' Haunted Horseman video slot is based on the same story. It is a 5-reel game with 99 adjustable paylines, featuring Ichabod, Katrina, Pumpkins, and the Killer Rider. It has a Tumbling Reels system, where all symbols that are part of a winning combination disappear to be replaced by new ones that fall from above. If this creates new wins, then the reels will fall again and again until there is a non-winning fall. Free spins and wild substitutes are also present in this eerie slot machine."

Based on the classic tale of Sleepy Hollow, this 5-reel and 40-line video slot is set in an American town haunted by a demon riding a black horse and accompanied by a glowing pumpkin. Treasure chests, crows, and covered bridges come together with Katrina Van Tassel and Ichabod Crane in this Lightning Box Games creation. With a flash of inspiration, developers have empowered lightning to trigger free spins where wins are guaranteed. The point on jackpots awarded following Lightning Respins or Flippin Retrigger Feature is correct.\nWith the headless rider as the high-paying wild symbol, offering you the chance to claim big jackpots during bonus spins, this slot machine can be played for real money bets for as little as €0.40 per spin. You can enjoy all the macabre action on desktop PCs, as well as on iPhones, iPads, and other Windows- and Android-powered mobile devices. Lightning Box Games is based in Sydney, Australia. It may not be the most well-known developer of online and mobile-optimized slots, but that is partly due to the fact that it produces many games for other developers. Hits such as Dolphin's Gold, Super Happy Fortune Cat, and Lost Temple are actually slots that have been developed by Lightning Box Games but released by partner companies.\nEerie graphics\nThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow has been told many times in the past, but here's a quick summary. Ichabod Crane is the schoolmaster of the village. One night, he encounters the ghost of a Hessian soldier who lost his head due to a cannonball. This is followed by a chase to a covered bridge, where Crane and the rider disappear in a flash of fire and sulfur. Told in Tim Burton's 1999 film and in TV series, it's a classic and enduring story that became particularly popular around Halloween.\nLet's return to the present and take a look at the Lightning Horseman video slot station. All the essential elements of the story have been cleverly woven into the reels. Among them, a background image of the town, twisted trees of the surrounding forest, and a gothic soundtrack that is sure to give you chills. It looks magnificent, although the graphics are perhaps a bit dated.\nSlot machine functions and symbols\nThe headless rider, with a carved pumpkin in hand, will be your wild feature and the symbol paying the highest to regular customers (600 times the line bet). The usual role in which you will see him appear will be that of substitute, and in this role he will help you the most. It can still help even if it appears only once, but it does nothing for you if it is the scatter that needs to be replaced. Lightning Bolt scatters can also appear, and they can do so on multiple positions on each reel. You end up needing at least 6 of these scatters to trigger a Lightning Respin, although as many as 13 can act in this feature. The Lightning Respin feature gives you 3 shots at the start, with the triggering scatters locked in place for the duration. Only the other positions spin. The goal is to get extra Lightning Bolts, so that they too can lock in place and reset the number of respins to 3. At the end of the feature, the Lightning Bolts flip over and give you prizes.\nIf you manage to fill the reels with 15 Lightning Bolts, then you get the Flippin Retrigger. All Lightning Bolts are flipped over and you receive prizes from them all.\nThe lightning bolt symbol is worth nothing on its own, but it has some very special talents that lead to some rewarding features. If you see six to 13 lightning bolts simultaneously anywhere, the Lightning Respin feature is activated. At the beginning, you get only three free spins, with all the lightning bolts locked in. If more lightning bolts appear, they too will stay in place, and you get another three free spins. This continues to accumulate the total symbol of lightning bolts until you get three rotations without any more symbols appearing, or until all 15 positions on the reels are occupied with these symbols. At the end of the spin, all the Lightning Bolts flip over to reveal prizes. Although not all of them will have any value, it is guaranteed that you will get at least some wins from the Lightning Respins feature. This changes if all 15 positions on the reels are filled with the Lightning Bolt, as the Flippin' Retrigger feature ensures that all symbols have a value. At the end of the Lightning Respins feature, during the Flippin' Retrigger feature you may be randomly awarded a Mini, Minor, Major, or Grand jackpot prize. These are not progressive jackpots, but they can still be worth sizable sums. At higher bet levels, the chances of hitting a jackpot - as well as the prize size - will rise.\nOther similar slot machines\nHigh 5 Games' Haunted Horseman video slot is based on the same story. It is a 5-reel game with 99 adjustable paylines, featuring Ichabod, Katrina, Pumpkins, and the Killer Rider. It has a Tumbling Reels system, where all symbols that are part of a winning combination disappear to be replaced by new ones that fall from above. If this creates new wins, then the reels will fall again and again until there is a non-winning fall. Free spins and wild substitutes are also present in this eerie slot machine.\n            ",

Developed by Lightning Box Games, the game features 5 reels and 40 paylines. The game is set in an American town haunted by a demon riding a black horse and accompanied by a glowing pumpkin. Treasure chests, crows, covered bridges, Katrina Van Tassel and Ichabod Crane are among the symbols.\n\nFeatures and graphics of Lightning Horseman slot game\n\nLightning Horseman features a gothic soundtrack that is sure to give you chills and the graphics are superbly eerie. The headless rider acts as a high-paying wild symbol in the game and is capable of helping you claim big jackpots during bonus spins. The game can be played on desktop PCs as well as on iPhones, iPads, and other Windows- and Android-powered mobile devices.\n\nHeadless rider as high-paying wild symbol\n\nThe headless rider symbol is the highest paying in the game and can reward you up to 600 times your line bet. It also acts as a substitute symbol. In this role, it can help you form winning combinations by replacing other symbols. However, it cannot substitute for the scatter symbol that needs to be replaced.\n\nLightning Respin feature\n\nThe Lightning Respin feature is activated when you have six to thirteen Lightning Bolt scatter symbols on the reels. At the start of the feature, you get three free spins, with all the triggering Lightning Bolt symbols locked in place. If more Lightning Bolt symbols appear, they too will remain in place, and you get another three free spins. If you fill 15 positions on the reels with these symbols, you trigger the Flippin Retrigger feature. All symbols will flip over, revealing prizes. During this feature, you may randomly be awarded a Mini, Minor, Major, or Grand jackpot prize. These are not progressive jackpots, but they can still be worth significant sums.\n\nFlippin' Retrigger feature\n\nThe Flippin' Retrigger feature is activated when you fill all 15 positions on the reels with the Lightning Bolt symbol during the Lightning Respin feature. All symbols will flip over to reveal prizes.\n\nJackpot prizes\n\nLightning Horseman does not offer progressive jackpots, but during the Flippin Retrigger feature, you may randomly be awarded a Mini, Minor, Major, or Grand jackpot prize. The Flippin Retrigger feature is activated when you fill all 15 positions on the reels with the Lightning Bolt symbol during the Lightning Respin feature. The chances of hitting a jackpot and the prize size increase at higher bet levels.\n\nLightning Box Games\n\nLightning Box Games is an online slot game developer based in Sydney, Australia. While it may not be the most well-known developer of online and mobile-optimized slots, it produces many games for other developers. Hits such as Dolphin's Gold, Super Happy Fortune Cat, and Lost Temple are actually slots that have been developed by Lightning Box Games but released by partner companies.\n\nSimilar slot machines\n\nHigh 5 Games' Haunted Horseman video slot is based on the same story as Lightning Horseman. It features 5 reels and 99 adjustable paylines, and it has a Tumbling Reels system, where all symbols that are part of a winning combination disappear to be replaced by new ones that fall from above. The game has free spins and wild substitutes.\n\n        \n            ",

Based on the classic tale of Sleepy Hollow, this 5-reel and 40-line video slot is set in an American town haunted by a demon riding a black horse and accompanied by a glowing pumpkin. Treasure chests, crows, and covered bridges come together with Katrina Van Tassel and Ichabod Crane in this Lightning Box Games creation. With a flash of inspiration, developers have empowered lightning to trigger free spins where wins are guaranteed. The point on jackpots awarded following Lightning Respins or Flippin Retrigger Feature is correct.\nWith the headless rider as the high-paying wild symbol, offering you the chance to claim big jackpots during bonus spins, this slot machine can be played for real money bets for as little as €0.40 per spin. You can enjoy all the macabre action on desktop PCs, as well as on iPhones, iPads, and other Windows- and Android-powered mobile devices. Lightning Box Games is based in Sydney, Australia. It may not be the most well-known developer of online and mobile-optimized slots, but that is partly due to the fact that it produces many games for other developers. Hits such as Dolphin's Gold, Super Happy Fortune Cat, and Lost Temple are actually slots that have been developed by Lightning Box Games but released by partner companies.\nEerie graphics\nThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow has been told many times in the past, but here's a quick summary. Ichabod Crane is the schoolmaster of the village. One night, he encounters the ghost of a Hessian soldier who lost his head due to a cannonball. This is followed by a chase to a covered bridge, where Crane and the rider disappear in a flash of fire and sulfur. Told in Tim Burton's 1999 film and in TV series, it's a classic and enduring story that became particularly popular around Halloween.\nLet's return to the present and take a look at the Lightning Horseman video slot station. All the essential elements of the story have been cleverly woven into the reels. Among them, a background image of the town, twisted trees of the surrounding forest, and a gothic soundtrack that is sure to give you chills. It looks magnificent, although the graphics are perhaps a bit dated.\nSlot machine functions and symbols\nThe headless rider, with a carved pumpkin in hand, will be your wild feature and the symbol paying the highest to regular customers (600 times the line bet). The usual role in which you will see him appear will be that of substitute, and in this role he will help you the most. It can still help even if it appears only once, but it does nothing for you if it is the scatter that needs to be replaced. Lightning Bolt scatters can also appear, and they can do so on multiple positions on each reel. You end up needing at least 6 of these scatters to trigger a Lightning Respin, although as many as 13 can act in this feature. The Lightning Respin feature gives you 3 shots at the start, with the triggering scatters locked in place for the duration. Only the other positions spin. The goal is to get extra Lightning Bolts, so that they too can lock in place and reset the number of respins to 3. At the end of the feature, the Lightning Bolts flip over and give you prizes.\nIf you manage to fill the reels with 15 Lightning Bolts, then you get the Flippin Retrigger. All Lightning Bolts are flipped over and you receive prizes from them all.\nThe lightning bolt symbol is worth nothing on its own, but it has some very special talents that lead to some rewarding features. If you see six to 13 lightning bolts simultaneously anywhere, the Lightning Respin feature is activated. At the beginning, you get only three free spins, with all the lightning bolts locked in. If more lightning bolts appear, they too will stay in place, and you get another three free spins. This continues to accumulate the total symbol of lightning bolts until you get three rotations without any more symbols appearing, or until all 15 positions on the reels are occupied with these symbols. At the end of the spin, all the Lightning Bolts flip over to reveal prizes. Although not all of them will have any value, it is guaranteed that you will get at least some wins from the Lightning Respins feature. This changes if all 15 positions on the reels are filled with the Lightning Bolt, as the Flippin' Retrigger feature ensures that all symbols have a value. At the end of the Lightning Respins feature, during the Flippin' Retrigger feature you may be randomly awarded a Mini, Minor, Major, or Grand jackpot prize. These are not progressive jackpots, but they can still be worth sizable sums. At higher bet levels, the chances of hitting a jackpot - as well as the prize size - will rise.\nOther similar slot machines\nHigh 5 Games' Haunted Horseman video slot is based on the same story. It is a 5-reel game with 99 adjustable paylines, featuring Ichabod, Katrina, Pumpkins, and the Killer Rider. It has a Tumbling Reels system, where all symbols that are part of a winning combination disappear to be replaced by new ones that fall from above. If this creates new wins, then the reels will fall again and again until there is a non-winning fall. Free spins and wild substitutes are also present in this eerie slot machine.\n            ",

Based on the classic tale of Sleepy Hollow, this 5-reel and 40-line video slot is set in an American town haunted by a demon riding a black horse and accompanied by a glowing pumpkin. Treasure chests, crows, and covered bridges come together with Katrina Van Tassel and Ichabod Crane in this Lightning Box Games creation. With a flash of inspiration, developers have empowered lightning to trigger free spins where wins are guaranteed. The point on jackpots awarded following Lightning Respins or Flippin Retrigger Feature is correct.\nWith the headless rider as the high-paying wild symbol, offering you the chance to claim big jackpots during bonus spins, this slot machine can be played for real money bets for as little as €0.40 per spin. You can enjoy all the macabre action on desktop PCs, as well as on iPhones, iPads, and other Windows- and Android-powered mobile devices. Lightning Box Games is based in Sydney, Australia. It may not be the most well-known developer of online and mobile-optimized slots, but that is partly due to the fact that it produces many games for other developers. Hits such as Dolphin's Gold, Super Happy Fortune Cat, and Lost Temple are actually slots that have been developed by Lightning Box Games but released by partner companies.\nEerie graphics\nThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow has been told many times in the past, but here's a quick summary. Ichabod Crane is the schoolmaster of the village. One night, he encounters the ghost of a Hessian soldier who lost his head due to a cannonball. This is followed by a chase to a covered bridge, where Crane and the rider disappear in a flash of fire and sulfur. Told in Tim Burton's 1999 film and in TV series, it's a classic and enduring story that became particularly popular around Halloween.\nLet's return to the present and take a look at the Lightning Horseman video slot station. All the essential elements of the story have been cleverly woven into the reels. Among them, a background image of the town, twisted trees of the surrounding forest, and a gothic soundtrack that is sure to give you chills. It looks magnificent, although the graphics are perhaps a bit dated.\nSlot machine functions and symbols\nThe headless rider, with a carved pumpkin in hand, will be your wild feature and the symbol paying the highest to regular customers (600 times the line bet). The usual role in which you will see him appear will be that of substitute, and in this role he will help you the most. It can still help even if it appears only once, but it does nothing for you if it is the scatter that needs to be replaced. Lightning Bolt scatters can also appear, and they can do so on multiple positions on each reel. You end up needing at least 6 of these scatters to trigger a Lightning Respin, although as many as 13 can act in this feature. The Lightning Respin feature gives you 3 shots at the start, with the triggering scatters locked in place for the duration. Only the other positions spin. The goal is to get extra Lightning Bolts, so that they too can lock in place and reset the number of respins to 3. At the end of the feature, the Lightning Bolts flip over and give you prizes.\nIf you manage to fill the reels with 15 Lightning Bolts, then you get the Flippin Retrigger. All Lightning Bolts are flipped over and you receive prizes from them all.\nThe lightning bolt symbol is worth nothing on its own, but it has some very special talents that lead to some rewarding features. If you see six to 13 lightning bolts simultaneously anywhere, the Lightning Respin feature is activated. At the beginning, you get only three free spins, with all the lightning bolts locked in. If more lightning bolts appear, they too will stay in place, and you get another three free spins. This continues to accumulate the total symbol of lightning bolts until you get three rotations without any more symbols appearing, or until all 15 positions on the reels are occupied with these symbols. At the end of the spin, all the Lightning Bolts flip over to reveal prizes. Although not all of them will have any value, it is guaranteed that you will get at least some wins from the Lightning Respins feature. This changes if all 15 positions on the reels are filled with the Lightning Bolt, as the Flippin' Retrigger feature ensures that all symbols have a value. At the end of the Lightning Respins feature, during the Flippin' Retrigger feature you may be randomly awarded a Mini, Minor, Major, or Grand jackpot prize. These are not progressive jackpots, but they can still be worth sizable sums. At higher bet levels, the chances of hitting a jackpot - as well as the prize size - will rise.\nOther similar slot machines\nHigh 5 Games' Haunted Horseman video slot is based on the same story. It is a 5-reel game with 99 adjustable paylines, featuring Ichabod, Katrina, Pumpkins, and the Killer Rider. It has a Tumbling Reels system, where all symbols that are part of a winning combination disappear to be replaced by new ones that fall from above. If this creates new wins, then the reels will fall again and again until there is a non-winning fall. Free spins and wild substitutes are also present in this eerie slot machine.\n        ",
