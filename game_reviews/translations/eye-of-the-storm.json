Instead of the usual depiction of the interiors of pyramids, we find ourselves on a balcony overlooking the city, from which we can admire some palaces and a pyramid.

In ascending order of value, we find the sun and the key of life, followed by the golden scarab beetle, then the dove, the cheetah, and finally the Eye of Ra.\n\nThe queen is the Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except for the Scatter one and expanding to cover the entire reel. The Scatter is represented by the pyramid. Besides appearing on all reels and rewarding with free spins, it also functions as a multiplier: 3 Scatters double the bet, 4 Scatters repay 20x the bet, and with 5 Scatters, we’ll see our initial wager multiplied by 50!\n\nBut that’s not all, as a special multilevel function is linked to Free Spins.

The game features a 5x3 grid with 10 fixed paylines, a minimum stake of 0.10 €, and a maximum of 250 €. It boasts an RTP of 96.71% and high volatility. The slot supports automatic spins, including some win or loss limits.\n\nSymbols and Special Features\n\nEye of the Storm has ten basic symbols, including four low-value ones represented by playing cards' figures and six high-value ones related to the Egyptian theme, such as the Eye of Ra, the scarab beetle, and the dove, among others. The queen is the slot's Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except for the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by the pyramid and appears on all reels, and it also functions as a multiplier. Eye of the Storm features a special multilevel function linked to Free Spins.\n\nMultilevel Function during Free Spins\n\nBefore starting the Bonus, the grid changes appearance, with the six high-value symbols arranged at the top of the reels. The multilevel function progresses like this: level 2: all sun symbols transform into key-of-life symbols; level 3: all key-of-life symbols become scarab beetles; level 4: all scarab beetles become doves; level 5: all doves transform into jaguars, and level 6: all jaguars become Eye of Ra symbols. During the special function, an additional Free Spin will be awarded for every Wild that appears on the reels. If 3 or more Scatters land on the reels, the free spins function will start all over again.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nEye of the Storm has an RTP of 96.71%, which is quite decent, and high volatility. Players should be aware that this means that the game can be risky but also rewarding if they manage to land some big wins.\n\nOverall Appeal and Recommendation\n\nEye of the Storm is a well-designed Egyptian-themed slot game that stands out for its graphics, animations, and soundtrack. It features a classic game grid and ten basic symbols, including a Wild and a Scatter. The multilevel function linked to Free Spins is undoubtedly a highlight of the game, providing players with significant potential winnings. The game's high volatility may not be suitable for casual players, but it's perfect for those looking for more excitement and thrill. Therefore, we recommend Eye of the Storm to fans of Egyptian-themed slots who seek high-risk, high-reward gameplay.\n\n        \n            ",

It’s a well-known fact that the mysteries and riches of this ancient period have always aroused great interest among gambling enthusiasts all over the world.\n\nAn Egyptian-themed slot game inevitably requires top-notch graphics, and we must admit that Reel Kingdom has done an excellent job. Instead of the usual depiction of the interiors of pyramids, we find ourselves on a balcony overlooking the city, from which we can admire some palaces and a pyramid. Next to the game grid, there are two columns decorated with various hieroglyphs, among which we can recognize those dedicated to the God Anubis. The clouds on the horizon and the lightning that occasionally disrupts the sky seem like an excellent way to increase the suspense.\n\nThe graphical experience is completed by an engrossing soundtrack and a few animations, mainly linked to victories.\n\nFeatures of the slot\nThe grid is a classic 5x3, with 10 fixed paylines, a minimum stake of 0.10 € and a maximum of 250 €. It’s possible to activate automatic spins, including some win or loss limits. The slot boasts an RTP of 96.71% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and features of Eye of the Storm\nTen basic symbols: four low-value and six high-value ones. The first four are represented by the three figures of playing cards, plus the Ace. The remaining six refer to the theme of Egypt. In ascending order of value, we find the sun and the key of life, followed by the golden scarab beetle, then the dove, the cheetah, and finally the Eye of Ra.\n\nThe queen is the Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except for the Scatter one and expanding to cover the entire reel. The Scatter is represented by the pyramid. Besides appearing on all reels and rewarding with free spins, it also functions as a multiplier: 3 Scatters double the bet, 4 Scatters repay 20x the bet, and with 5 Scatters, we’ll see our initial wager multiplied by 50!\n\nBut that’s not all, as a special multilevel function is linked to Free Spins. Before starting the Bonus, the grid changes appearance, with the six high-value symbols arranged at the top of the reels. We start with the normal level and then progress like this:\n\nlevel 2: all sun symbols transform into key-of-life symbols\nlevel 3: all key-of-life symbols become scarab beetles\nlevel 4: all scarab beetles become doves\nlevel 5: all doves transform into jaguars\nlevel 6: all jaguars become Eye of Ra symbols\n\nDuring the special function, an additional Free Spin will be awarded for every Wild that appears on the reels. If 3 or more Scatters land on the reels, the free spins function will start all over again.\n            ",

It’s a well-known fact that the mysteries and riches of this ancient period have always aroused great interest among gambling enthusiasts all over the world.\n\nAn Egyptian-themed slot game inevitably requires top-notch graphics, and we must admit that Reel Kingdom has done an excellent job. Instead of the usual depiction of the interiors of pyramids, we find ourselves on a balcony overlooking the city, from which we can admire some palaces and a pyramid. Next to the game grid, there are two columns decorated with various hieroglyphs, among which we can recognize those dedicated to the God Anubis. The clouds on the horizon and the lightning that occasionally disrupts the sky seem like an excellent way to increase the suspense.\n\nThe graphical experience is completed by an engrossing soundtrack and a few animations, mainly linked to victories.\n\nFeatures of the slot\nThe grid is a classic 5x3, with 10 fixed paylines, a minimum stake of 0.10 € and a maximum of 250 €. It’s possible to activate automatic spins, including some win or loss limits. The slot boasts an RTP of 96.71% and high volatility.\n\nSymbols and features of Eye of the Storm\nTen basic symbols: four low-value and six high-value ones. The first four are represented by the three figures of playing cards, plus the Ace. The remaining six refer to the theme of Egypt. In ascending order of value, we find the sun and the key of life, followed by the golden scarab beetle, then the dove, the cheetah, and finally the Eye of Ra.\n\nThe queen is the Wild symbol, replacing all symbols except for the Scatter one and expanding to cover the entire reel. The Scatter is represented by the pyramid. Besides appearing on all reels and rewarding with free spins, it also functions as a multiplier: 3 Scatters double the bet, 4 Scatters repay 20x the bet, and with 5 Scatters, we’ll see our initial wager multiplied by 50!\n\nBut that’s not all, as a special multilevel function is linked to Free Spins. Before starting the Bonus, the grid changes appearance, with the six high-value symbols arranged at the top of the reels. We start with the normal level and then progress like this:\n\nlevel 2: all sun symbols transform into key-of-life symbols\nlevel 3: all key-of-life symbols become scarab beetles\nlevel 4: all scarab beetles become doves\nlevel 5: all doves transform into jaguars\nlevel 6: all jaguars become Eye of Ra symbols\n\nDuring the special function, an additional Free Spin will be awarded for every Wild that appears on the reels. If 3 or more Scatters land on the reels, the free spins function will start all over again.\n            ",
