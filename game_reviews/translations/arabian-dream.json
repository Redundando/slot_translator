There are animations and interactive objects in the most unexpected places. The symbols are also perfectly matched to the theme, with precious gems, camels, flying carpets, the Sultan, and the Princess. Of course, the magic lamp could not be missing, which serves as the Wild symbol. There is also a bonus symbol recognizable by the word “Bonus” decorated in the typical style of Oriental art. \n\nThe sound design is exceptional, contributing perfectly to immerse the player in this magical and surreal atmosphere.

Depending on the winning color, the player will receive a different number of free spins, accompanied by a multiplier, for a maximum of 30 free spins and a 3x multiplier.

The allure is undeniable, as evidenced by the famous tale of the magic lamp and of course, the Disney film Aladdin. Zeusplay immerses players in these magical nights with Arabian Dream, where you find yourself in a royal palace, with the opportunity to realize your dreams. \n\nBut have they really created a slot machine worthy of such a theme? Let us analyze the artistic design and gameplay of this promising slot. \n\nBetween Dreams and the Stars of Arabian Dream\n\nArabian Dream takes us to the balcony of a royal palace, possibly that of the princess’s chamber. From here you can see a starry sky, which serves as a backdrop to the classic 5x3 grid with a frame perfectly in line with the art and architecture of the Orient. \n\nIn its simplicity, the slot is surprisingly detailed. There are animations and interactive objects in the most unexpected places. The symbols are also perfectly matched to the theme, with precious gems, camels, flying carpets, the Sultan, and the Princess. Of course, the magic lamp could not be missing, which serves as the Wild symbol. There is also a bonus symbol recognizable by the word “Bonus” decorated in the typical style of Oriental art. \n\nThe sound design is exceptional, contributing perfectly to immerse the player in this magical and surreal atmosphere. The background music is perfect, evocative, and hypnotic. The sound effects are similar to the gentle clinking of coins, and accompany the music gracefully. \n\nRealize Your Dreams with Arabian Dream\n\nWith Arabian Dream, Zeusplay offers traditional gameplay alongside an intriguing bonus mode perfectly matched to the rest of the slot. As mentioned earlier, the basic gameplay of Arabian Dream is that of a classic slot machine, hypnotic and relaxing, especially due to the design and music. This makes gameplay without too many complications perfect for players who want to be transported into the world of Arabian Dream. \n\nThe bonus mode we mentioned earlier is the magic lamp function. Finding three or more bonus symbols in a single play will activate it. Once activated, 20 magic lamps appear on the grid, and by selecting them, the player must find three of the same color. Depending on the winning color, the player will receive a different number of free spins, accompanied by a multiplier, for a maximum of 30 free spins and a 3x multiplier. These free spins will increase in case of new combinations with bonus symbols. \n\nSimilar Slots to Arabian Dream\n\nWith its low volatility and RTP of 96%, perfectly in the middle range, Arabian Dream is an interesting experience worth trying, even just for a few plays. Both players looking for more traditional slots and those seeking unique and memorable bonus functions will be satisfied. If you are looking for similar slots to Arabian Dream, we recommend trying Arabian Nights and Genie’s Palace.\n            ",
