Mondo tipicamente maschile, questa slot rovescia tutte le regole del gioco ponendo al centro della scena tre fanciulle dall’aspetto molto più che gradevole ma non per questo meno determinate!\nLa grafica di Bounty Belles pur non essendo super dettagliata, ha il pregio di ricreare le atmosfere degne del nome Western, anche grazie alla colonna sonora, la stessa che si ritrova in tanti film a tema.

Sulla sinistra ci sono i tasti Play e Autoplay, per il resto si trova tutto nel menù.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nUna griglia a 5 rulli e 3 righe, con i primi due rulli segnalati dalla cornice di legno per rendere evidente la funzione Wild Bounty che illustreremo tra poco.

A typically masculine world, this slot turns all the rules of the game upside down by placing three girls at the center of the stage, who are not only pleasant to look at but also extremely determined!\n\nThe graphics of Bounty Belles, while not super detailed, have the merit of recreating Western-style atmospheres, thanks also to the soundtrack, the same one found in many themed films. In the background, we can admire a saloon in the middle of a desert landscape, while in the foreground is the game grid complete with logo and jackpot. On the left are the Play and Autoplay buttons, while everything else can be found in the menu.\n\nSlot features\n\nA grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, with the first two reels marked by a wooden frame to highlight the Wild Bounty function that we will illustrate shortly. There are 243 ways to win. You can bet from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €20. There is also a Turbo function, and you can select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins. The volatility is high and has an RTP of 95.99%.\n\nSymbols and functionality\n\nIn Bounty Belles, there are 9 basic symbols, 5 of low value and 4 of high value. The first are represented by playing cards good for a royal flush, while the second are Western-themed: the hat and horseshoe are of equal value, the dollar bag is slightly higher, followed by the safe, and finally, the guns.\n\nThe sheriff's star is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The latter is represented by the word Bonus.\n\nIf 2 Wild symbols appear on reels 1 and 2, the Wild Bounty mode is activated. In practice, the reels expand by 1 or 2 rows starting from the third reel, thus passing from a 5x3 grid to a 5x4 or 5x5 grid. If one of the 3 girls stops on the reels during the Wild Bounty function, then the amounts associated with her will be won.\n\nAs for the Scatter, the free spins are distributed as follows:\n\n3 Bonus symbols = 10 Free Spins\n4 Bonus symbols = 12 Free Spins\n5 Bonus symbols = 15 Free Spins\n\nMoreover, before each Free Spin, a card is shown on which the multiplier that will be applied to each win is indicated.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that on the 5th reel, the symbol with one of the 3 available jackpots can appear: with the minor, you win 30x your bet, with the major 50x, and with the grand 100x!\n            ",

A typically masculine world, this slot turns all the rules of the game upside down by placing three girls at the center of the stage, who are not only pleasant to look at but also extremely determined!\n\nThe graphics of Bounty Belles, while not super detailed, have the merit of recreating Western-style atmospheres, thanks also to the soundtrack, the same one found in many themed films. In the background, we can admire a saloon in the middle of a desert landscape, while in the foreground is the game grid complete with logo and jackpot. On the left are the Play and Autoplay buttons, while everything else can be found in the menu.\n\nSlot features\n\nA grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, with the first two reels marked by a wooden frame to highlight the Wild Bounty function that we will illustrate shortly. There are 243 ways to win. You can bet from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €20. There is also a Turbo function, and you can select between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins. The volatility is high and has an RTP of 95.99%.\n\nSymbols and functionality\n\nIn Bounty Belles, there are 9 basic symbols, 5 of low value and 4 of high value. The first are represented by playing cards good for a royal flush, while the second are Western-themed: the hat and horseshoe are of equal value, the dollar bag is slightly higher, followed by the safe, and finally, the guns.\n\nThe sheriff's star is the Wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The latter is represented by the word Bonus.\n\nIf 2 Wild symbols appear on reels 1 and 2, the Wild Bounty mode is activated. In practice, the reels expand by 1 or 2 rows starting from the third reel, thus passing from a 5x3 grid to a 5x4 or 5x5 grid. If one of the 3 girls stops on the reels during the Wild Bounty function, then the amounts associated with her will be won.\n\nAs for the Scatter, the free spins are distributed as follows:\n\n3 Bonus symbols = 10 Free Spins\n4 Bonus symbols = 12 Free Spins\n5 Bonus symbols = 15 Free Spins\n\nMoreover, before each Free Spin, a card is shown on which the multiplier that will be applied to each win is indicated.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that on the 5th reel, the symbol with one of the 3 available jackpots can appear: with the minor, you win 30x your bet, with the major 50x, and with the grand 100x!\n            ",
