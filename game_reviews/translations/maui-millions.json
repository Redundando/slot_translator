It is in fact a Scatter symbol and finding at least three in a single play will activate the bonus mode.\nIn this mode there will be many more multipliers on the winnings and the possibility of unlocking further free spins (although this is not guaranteed and may last very little).\nThere is an additional bonus mode called \"Cash Spins\", during which we will be able to fill our game grid with only symbols, each with a win and a multiplier on the final win.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics\n\nMaui Millions is an online slot game developed by Kalamba Games with a game layout with five reels and three horizontal lines, which dissociates from the 6*4 layout often proposed by Kalamba Games. The slot has an RTP (Return to Player) of 97.39%, with a rather high volatility, and 243 winning lines.\n\nBonus Modes\n\nMaui Millions offers two bonus modes, the first one is activated when you find at least three Scatter symbols, represented by palm trees. During this mode, players will benefit from more multipliers on winnings, and the possibility of unlocking additional free spins. The second bonus mode, called 'Cash Spins,' involves a game grid filled with only symbols, each with a win and a multiplier on the final win. This mode provides access to truly extraordinary wins.\n\nGraphics and Music\n\nMaui Millions has impressive graphics and offers a colorful, tropical feel with an interface adorned with bright colors, flowers, sandals, coconut, guitars, drums, and more. The sound follows suit, with a light music accompanying the games that blends well with the game's visuals.\n\nComparisons to Similar Games\n\nFor those who enjoy staying on a tropical atoll and on the sea, Maui Millions is a great choice. Those who are fans of pirate-themed slots like Boom Pirates by Foxium or Pirates Charm by Quickspin will also find Maui Millions enjoyable. Fans of Merkur Gaming will appreciate Tropical Heat's tropical aesthetic.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP)\n\nWith an RTP of 97.39%, Maui Millions offers players a high chance of winning. However, with a rather high volatility, players may experience many unsuccessful games before receiving a large payout.\n\n        \n            ",
