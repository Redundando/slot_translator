Television is also a source of inspiration, and Mega Jackpots: Wheel of Fortune On Air from IGT is a slot game inspired by the famous TV game show known in Italy as \"Ruota della Fortuna\".\nWith its eye-catching graphics and nostalgia for a television program that has been a part of many of our lives, Mega Jackpots: Wheel of Fortune On Air is definitely a very interesting slot game.\nNow, let's proceed with the review, starting with its graphical appearance.\nMega Jackpots: Wheel of Fortune On Air – The graphical aspect\nThis slot game immediately brings to mind the game show \"Wheel of Fortune\". The game grid is set against a beautiful starry sky background, with a multitude of bright colors standing out particularly.\nMega Jackpots: Wheel of Fortune On Air catches the eye immediately with its use of vivid and typical game show colors, but above all with the actual wheel of fortune located on the left side of the grid. The grid itself is reminiscent of the program board where the letters appeared.\nInstead of phrases to be composed, we will see symbols. These are divided between classic symbols like those of playing cards, namely the simple initials A, K, Q and J, and special symbols that represent the concept of wealth that characterizes Mega Jackpots slots. Such as yachts, private jets, jewelry, and sports cars.\nThe graphics of Mega Jackpots: Wheel of Fortune On Air are actually very simple, and its charm lies almost entirely in being a tribute to a beloved television program. The sound effects blend perfectly with the jingles and even the noise of the audience in the background.\nLet's now move on to a more technical review of this slot game.\nMega Jackpots: Wheel of Fortune On Air – The actual game\nFrom a strictly mechanical point of view, the slot game combines a traditional game grid based on five reels and three lines (displaying fifteen symbols on each spin) with unique special functions.\nOn the left side of the slot game, in fact, is the Wheel of Fortune: by finding at least three matching symbols, we can obtain a spin of the wheel and win the corresponding prize. The various prizes available on the wheel are different, from simple multipliers on the bet (6X, for example, allows you to win 6 times the value of the bet) to mysterious symbols. In this case, a random number of symbols in the game screen will be transformed into a single symbol, with the possibility of obtaining much higher winnings.\nBy finding four Scatter symbols, we will obtain the Super Wheel, where multipliers become much higher (x30 and x40) and by finding five, these multipliers become even higher, reaching values even up to x250).\nBy obtaining the Jackpot symbol, we will access a special mode where we will have to open envelopes hoping to obtain a jackpot that can reach astronomical figures!\nSlot games similar to Mega Jackpots: Wheel of Fortune On Air\nIf we are looking for similar titles (perhaps shorter), we can opt for Who Wants to be a Millionaire or even Britain's Got Talent from Ash Gaming.\n        ",
