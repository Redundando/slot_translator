Ti sembra il tuo genere di accordo?\nBeh, se è così, allora non perdete tempo a pensare – Black Forest, una video slot della Spearhead Studios colpirà la vostra fantasia meglio della maggior parte delle altre slot.

Con niente, a parte i rulli e la costruzione in legno dove le opzioni sono posizionate sul fondo dei rulli, ci si può aspettare un design sorprendente. Sviluppato nel 2015, offre la migliore grafica e la musica è in qualche modo mistica e intrigante. Quindi, prima di premere il pulsante Spin, date un’occhiata a come è il gameplay qui sotto e come potete vincere i prezzi migliori.\nCi sono decine di slot irlandesi, e molte di queste sono già state recensite da noi qui. Se si sfogliano queste slot irlandesi, una cosa sarebbe molto chiara: quasi tutte cercano di portare nel mix lo stile di vita rilassato e la cultura festaiola per cui l’Irlanda è conosciuta in tutto il mondo, a volte ricorrendo a simboli ovvi, altre volte prendendo aiuto dalla ricca mitologia.\nMa Black Forest è un po’ diverso da tutte queste altre slot, in quanto non cerca mai di stereotipare l’Irlanda. Sceglie piuttosto di cercare il maggior aiuto possibile da vari miti gaelici, senza mai sottomettersi alle pressioni della commercializzazione. Questo potrebbe sembrare banale, soprattutto se si considera che si tratta di una slot giocabile a partire da un centesimo. Ma piccole cose come queste contano alla lunga, e noi abbiamo certamente un occhio di riguardo!\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nBene, finora tutto è andato secondo i piani e le aspettative. Vediamo se il gameplay ci riserva qualche sorpresa.\nCominciamo con l’indicare i parametri più importanti del gameplay. Questo slot ha 5 bobine standard e 20 linee di pagamento statiche. Le linee di pagamento non possono essere regolate in base alle vostre esigenze o richieste, e questo dovrebbe essere visto come una benedizione sotto mentite spoglie, in particolare dai principianti, perché questo significa che c’è una cosa in meno di cui preoccuparsi. Tutto quello che devono fare è mettere in gioco le monete e lasciare che le bobine si strappino!\nCi sarebbe sicuramente piaciuto vedere almeno altre dieci linee di pagamento in più per portare una sorta di uniformità nel gameplay, ma l’attuale assetto non è da disprezzare in alcun modo.\nSe siete entusiasti di esplorare questa foresta oscura alla ricerca di quelle ricchezze mitiche, dovrete però sapere dove colpire più duramente.\nCi sono nove simboli normali in questo gioco, e sono tutti in tema – da una ghianda a un libro di incantesimi, due streghe e pozioni, funghi e alberi, e un calderone come simboli standard del gioco. Cose tipiche che potreste trovare se vi imbattete in una foresta magica intorno alla vostra città.\nCi sono due simboli speciali che sono qui per rendere le cose più piccanti in questo gioco, e sono il simbolo del Wild Card che si può notare da due fantasmi che girano in cerchio e il simbolo del bonus rappresentato da un ragno.\nC’è una caratteristica bonus in Black Forest e si chiama Bonus Tesoro del Ragno. Questo viene attivato da tre o più simboli di ragno bonus e una volta che si riesce a farli atterrare, si verrà portati su una nuova schermata dove sarà necessario scegliere tra i bozzoli e rivelare i moltiplicatori al loro interno. Il totale dei moltiplicatori ricevuti sarà applicato alla vostra scommessa.\nPer fare la differenza, però, dovrete sfruttare al massimo i simboli speciali. Il simbolo Wild di questa slot è un folletto malizioso – tutto vestito di verde, e che lampeggia un sigaro e una moneta d’oro. Il jolly – oltre a prendersi cura delle combinazioni di metà cuore – paga generosamente, 7500 monete per combo cinque contro cinque.\nCome se non bastasse, la dispersione rende le cose davvero interessanti, offrendo una taglia extra di 2.000 monete e fino a 10 giri gratis con un moltiplicatore 3x senza senso.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nGiocate all’eccellente nuova release di Habanero Gaming chiamata Magic Oak.

But fear not for it is not all too dark. In fact, you'll see the possibility of winning the elusive leprechaun's treasure and if you do, you'll climb up to glory and power in one swift stroke. Does this sound like your kind of deal?\nWell then, don't waste any time thinking – Black Forest, a video slot game from Spearhead Studios will captivate your imagination better than most other slots. Keep on reading to learn more about this slot and how you can turn small bets into big jackpots.\nWith mesmerizing symbols, a bonus multiplier game, and a lucrative jackpot, you'll surely find everything you desire in a slot game!\nDark and Magical Graphics\nA dark yet magical forest is the first thing you'll see when you open the game. With nothing but the reels and wooden structure where the options are placed at the bottom of the reels, you can expect stunning designs. Developed in 2015, it offers the best graphics, and the music is somewhat mystical and intriguing. So, before you press the Spin button, take a look at the gameplay below and see how you can win the best rewards.\nThere are plenty of Irish-themed slots out there, and many of them have been reviewed by us here. If you browse through these Irish slots, one thing would be very clear: almost all of them try to bring into the mix the relaxed lifestyle and party culture for which Ireland is known worldwide, sometimes resorting to obvious symbols, other times taking help from the rich mythology.\nBut Black Forest is a bit different from all these other slots, as it never tries to stereotype Ireland. It chose rather to seek as much help as possible from various Gaelic myths, without ever succumbing to the pressures of commercialization. This might seem trivial, especially considering that it's a playable slot starting from a penny. But small things like these count in the long run, and we certainly have an eye for details!\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nWell, so far, everything has gone according to plan and expectations. Let's see if the gameplay has any surprises in store for us.\nLet's start by pointing out the most important parameters of the gameplay. This slot has 5 standard reels and 20 static paylines. The paylines cannot be adjusted according to your needs or requests, and this should be seen as a blessing in disguise, particularly by beginners, because it means there's one less thing to worry about. All they have to do is wager the coins and let the reels rip!\nWe would have certainly liked to see at least another ten paylines to bring some sort of uniformity in the gameplay, but the current setup is not to be disdained in any way.\nIf you're excited to explore this dark forest in search of those mythical riches, you will need to know where to hit hardest.\nThere are nine regular symbols in this game, and they're all themed – from an acorn to a spellbook, two witches and potions, mushrooms and trees, and a cauldron as standard game symbols. Typical things you might find if you stumble upon a magical forest around your city.\nThere are two special symbols that are here to spice things up in this game, and they are the Wild Card symbol which can be noticed by two ghosts circling and the bonus symbol represented by a spider.\nThere is a bonus feature in Black Forest and it's called the Spider Treasure Bonus. This is triggered by three or more bonus spider symbols and once you manage to land them, you'll be taken to a new screen where you'll need to choose between cocoons and reveal the multipliers inside them. The total of the multipliers received will be applied to your bet.\nTo make a difference, however, you'll need to make the most out of the special symbols. The Wild symbol of this slot is a mischievous leprechaun – all dressed in green, and flashing a cigar and a gold coin. The Wild – apart from taking care of the half-heart combinations – pays generously, 7500 coins for a combo of five against five.\nAs if that wasn't enough, the scatter makes things really interesting, offering an extra bounty of 2,000 coins and up to 10 free spins with a senseless 3x multiplier.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nPlay the excellent new release from Habanero Gaming called Magic Oak. It's a four by four game with no paylines but with cluster wins. Experience magical gameplay that has a super-powerful Wild symbol that delivers the game's biggest prize.

But it's not all too dark - you can see the chance of winning the elusive treasure of the gnome, and if you do, you'll reach your passageway up to glory and power in one go. Does this sound like your kind of deal?\nWell, if it is, then don't waste time thinking - Black Forest, a video slot by Spearhead Studios will hit your imagination better than most other slots. Keep reading to find out more about this slot and how you can turn meagre bets into big jackpots.\nWith appealing symbols, a bonus multiplier game, and a lucrative jackpot, you'll surely find everything you desire in a slot game!\nA dark and magical graphics\nA dark yet magical forest is the first sight of the game you'll see once the game is opened. With nothing else but the reels and wooden structure where the options are placed at the bottom of the reels, one can expect a stunning design. Developed in 2015, it offers the best graphics and music is somewhat mystical and intriguing. So, before pressing the Spin button, take a look at how the gameplay is beneath and how you can win the best prizes.\nThere are dozens of Irish slots, and many of these have already been reviewed by us here. If you browse through these Irish slots, one thing would be very clear: almost all of them try to bring into the mix the laid-back lifestyle and festive culture for which Ireland is known around the world, sometimes resorting to obvious symbols, other times taking help from rich mythology.\nBut Black Forest is somewhat different from all these other slots, as it never tries to stereotype Ireland. Rather, it chooses to seek as much help as possible from various Gaelic myths, without ever succumbing to the pressures of commercialization. This may seem trivial, especially considering that it is a playable slot starting from a penny. But little things like these count in the long run, and we certainly have an eye for it!\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\nWell, so far everything has gone according to plan and expectations. Let's see if the gameplay has any surprises in store for us.\nLet's start by indicating the most important parameters of gameplay. This slot has 5 standard reels and 20 static paylines. Paylines cannot be adjusted according to your needs or requests, and this should be seen as a blessing in disguise, particularly by beginners, because this means there is one less thing to worry about. All they have to do is stake the coins and let the reels rip!\nWe would have certainly liked to see at least ten more paylines to bring a sort of uniformity in gameplay, but the current setup is by no means to be despised.\nIf you are excited to explore this dark forest in search of those mythical riches, you will need to know where to hit harder.\nThere are nine normal symbols in this game, and they are all in theme - from an acorn to a spellbook, two witches and potions, mushrooms and trees, and a cauldron as standard game symbols. Typical things you might find if you stumble upon a magical forest around your town.\nThere are two special symbols that are here to spice things up in this game, and they are the Wild Card symbol that can be noticed by two ghosts circling around and the bonus symbol represented by a spider.\nThere is a bonus feature in Black Forest and it is called Spider's Treasure Bonus. This is triggered by three or more bonus spider symbols and once you manage to land them, you will be taken to a new screen where you will need to choose from cocoons and reveal the multipliers inside them. The total multipliers received will be applied to your bet.\nTo make a difference, though, you will need to make the most of the special symbols. The Wild symbol of this slot is a mischievous gnome - all dressed in green, and flashing a cigar and a gold coin. The wild - apart from taking care of the half heart combinations - pays handsomely, 7500 coins for a five-to-five combo.\nAs if that wasn't enough, the scatter makes things really interesting, offering an extra 2,000 coins award and up to 10 free spins with meaningless 3x multiplier.\nOther similar Slot Machines\nPlay Habanero Gaming's excellent new release called Magic Oak. It is a four-by-four game with no paylines, but with cluster payout. Experience a magical gameplay that has a super powerful Wild symbol that delivers the biggest prize of the game. Additionally, Magic Oak has a progressive jackpot and a big jackpot prize, as well as two smaller pots. Both can be won. Start playing with a welcome offer that you can claim from this page."

All they have to do is wager the coins and let the reels rip!\nWe would have certainly liked to see at least another ten paylines to bring some sort of uniformity in the gameplay, but the current setup is not to be disdained in any way.\nIf you're excited to explore this dark forest in search of those mythical riches, you will need to know where to hit hardest.\nThere are nine regular symbols in this game, and they're all themed – from an acorn to a spellbook, two witches and potions, mushrooms and trees, and a cauldron as standard game symbols. Typical things you might find if you stumble upon a magical forest around your city.\nThere are two special symbols that are here to spice things up in this game, and they are the Wild Card symbol which can be noticed by two ghosts circling and the bonus symbol represented by a spider.\nThere is a bonus feature in Black Forest and it's called the Spider Treasure Bonus. This is triggered by three or more bonus spider symbols and once you manage to land them, you'll be taken to a new screen where you'll need to choose between cocoons and reveal the multipliers inside them. The total of the multipliers received will be applied to your bet.\nTo make a difference, however, you'll need to make the most out of the special symbols. The Wild symbol of this slot is a mischievous leprechaun – all dressed in green, and flashing a cigar and a gold coin. The Wild – apart from taking care of the half-heart combinations – pays generously, 7500 coins for a combo of five against five.\nAs if that wasn't enough, the scatter makes things really interesting, offering an extra bounty of 2,000 coins and up to 10 free spins with a senseless 3x multiplier.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nPlay the excellent new release from Habanero Gaming called Magic Oak. It's a four by four game with no paylines but with cluster wins. Experience magical gameplay that has a super-powerful Wild symbol that delivers the game's biggest prize. Additionally, Magic Oak has a progressive jackpot and a big jackpot prize, plus two smaller pots. Both can be won.

The forest is calling you with a whisper and you have no choice but to answer the call. But fear not for it is not all too dark. In fact, you'll see the possibility of winning the elusive leprechaun's treasure and if you do, you'll climb up to glory and power in one swift stroke. Does this sound like your kind of deal?\nWell then, don't waste any time thinking – Black Forest, a video slot game from Spearhead Studios will captivate your imagination better than most other slots. Keep on reading to learn more about this slot and how you can turn small bets into big jackpots.\nWith mesmerizing symbols, a bonus multiplier game, and a lucrative jackpot, you'll surely find everything you desire in a slot game!\nDark and Magical Graphics\nA dark yet magical forest is the first thing you'll see when you open the game. With nothing but the reels and wooden structure where the options are placed at the bottom of the reels, you can expect stunning designs. Developed in 2015, it offers the best graphics, and the music is somewhat mystical and intriguing. So, before you press the Spin button, take a look at the gameplay below and see how you can win the best rewards.\nThere are plenty of Irish-themed slots out there, and many of them have been reviewed by us here. If you browse through these Irish slots, one thing would be very clear: almost all of them try to bring into the mix the relaxed lifestyle and party culture for which Ireland is known worldwide, sometimes resorting to obvious symbols, other times taking help from the rich mythology.\nBut Black Forest is a bit different from all these other slots, as it never tries to stereotype Ireland. It chose rather to seek as much help as possible from various Gaelic myths, without ever succumbing to the pressures of commercialization. This might seem trivial, especially considering that it's a playable slot starting from a penny. But small things like these count in the long run, and we certainly have an eye for details!\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nWell, so far, everything has gone according to plan and expectations.

It is a playable slot starting from a penny and offers a bonus multiplier game, a lucrative jackpot, and mesmerizing symbols that you can win big with. It features five standard reels and 20 static paylines. The paylines cannot be adjusted, making it simpler for beginners to play. The regular symbols are themed with two special symbols, the Wild Card symbol represented by two circling ghosts and the bonus symbol represented by a spider.\n\nDeveloper and game features\n\nDeveloped in 2015 by Spearhead Studios, Black Forest is a slot game that has outstanding graphics and sound effects that will take players on a magical journey through a dark forest. It features the most important parameters a slot game needs – 20 static paylines, a bonus multiplier game, a jackpot, and nine themed regular symbols as well as two special symbols, the Wild Card and Bonus symbol, to spice things up.\n\nGame graphics and soundtrack\n\nBlack Forest's graphics are dark yet magical, lending the game a mystical and intriguing theme. The wooden structure at the bottom of the reels contrasts beautifully with the darker hues of the background, and the sound effects and music perfectly capture the essence of a dark forest.\n\nReels and paylines\n\nBlack Forest features five standard reels and 20 static paylines that cannot be adjusted according to the needs or requests of the player. This makes it a great game for beginners as they only need to wager the coins and spin the reels.\n\nThemed symbols and Wild symbol\n\nBlack Forest's nine regular symbols are themed, ranging from an acorn to a spellbook, two witches and potions, mushrooms and trees, and a cauldron as standard game symbols. The Wild symbol is a mischievous leprechaun that not only takes care of the half-heart combinations; it pays generously, 7500 coins for a combo of five against five, flashing a cigar and a gold coin. \n\nSpider bonus feature and multipliers\n\nBlack Forest features a Spider Treasure Bonus that is triggered by landing three or more bonus spider symbols. This takes you to a new screen where you select between cocoons to reveal multipliers that are applied to your bet. The total of the multipliers received can boost your winnings significantly. The scatter symbol also offers an extra bounty of 2,000 coins and up to 10 free spins with a 3x multiplier.\n\nComparison to other Irish-themed slots\n\nUnlike many other Irish-themed slots that focus on the relaxed lifestyle and party culture of Ireland or use obvious symbols, Black Forest seeks help from various Gaelic myths, without ever succumbing to the pressures of commercialization. This unique take on an Irish-themed slot is refreshing and a definite must-try for players looking for something different. \n\n        \n            ",

The forest is calling you with a whisper and you have no choice but to answer the call. But fear not for it is not all too dark. In fact, you'll see the possibility of winning the elusive leprechaun's treasure and if you do, you'll climb up to glory and power in one swift stroke. Does this sound like your kind of deal?\nWell then, don't waste any time thinking – Black Forest, a video slot game from Spearhead Studios will captivate your imagination better than most other slots. Keep on reading to learn more about this slot and how you can turn small bets into big jackpots.\nWith mesmerizing symbols, a bonus multiplier game, and a lucrative jackpot, you'll surely find everything you desire in a slot game!\nDark and Magical Graphics\nA dark yet magical forest is the first thing you'll see when you open the game. With nothing but the reels and wooden structure where the options are placed at the bottom of the reels, you can expect stunning designs. Developed in 2015, it offers the best graphics, and the music is somewhat mystical and intriguing. So, before you press the Spin button, take a look at the gameplay below and see how you can win the best rewards.\nThere are plenty of Irish-themed slots out there, and many of them have been reviewed by us here. If you browse through these Irish slots, one thing would be very clear: almost all of them try to bring into the mix the relaxed lifestyle and party culture for which Ireland is known worldwide, sometimes resorting to obvious symbols, other times taking help from the rich mythology.\nBut Black Forest is a bit different from all these other slots, as it never tries to stereotype Ireland. It chose rather to seek as much help as possible from various Gaelic myths, without ever succumbing to the pressures of commercialization. This might seem trivial, especially considering that it's a playable slot starting from a penny. But small things like these count in the long run, and we certainly have an eye for details!\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nWell, so far, everything has gone according to plan and expectations. Let's see if the gameplay has any surprises in store for us.\nLet's start by pointing out the most important parameters of the gameplay. This slot has 5 standard reels and 20 static paylines. The paylines cannot be adjusted according to your needs or requests, and this should be seen as a blessing in disguise, particularly by beginners, because it means there's one less thing to worry about. All they have to do is wager the coins and let the reels rip!\nWe would have certainly liked to see at least another ten paylines to bring some sort of uniformity in the gameplay, but the current setup is not to be disdained in any way.\nIf you're excited to explore this dark forest in search of those mythical riches, you will need to know where to hit hardest.\nThere are nine regular symbols in this game, and they're all themed – from an acorn to a spellbook, two witches and potions, mushrooms and trees, and a cauldron as standard game symbols. Typical things you might find if you stumble upon a magical forest around your city.\nThere are two special symbols that are here to spice things up in this game, and they are the Wild Card symbol which can be noticed by two ghosts circling and the bonus symbol represented by a spider.\nThere is a bonus feature in Black Forest and it's called the Spider Treasure Bonus. This is triggered by three or more bonus spider symbols and once you manage to land them, you'll be taken to a new screen where you'll need to choose between cocoons and reveal the multipliers inside them. The total of the multipliers received will be applied to your bet.\nTo make a difference, however, you'll need to make the most out of the special symbols. The Wild symbol of this slot is a mischievous leprechaun – all dressed in green, and flashing a cigar and a gold coin. The Wild – apart from taking care of the half-heart combinations – pays generously, 7500 coins for a combo of five against five.\nAs if that wasn't enough, the scatter makes things really interesting, offering an extra bounty of 2,000 coins and up to 10 free spins with a senseless 3x multiplier.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nPlay the excellent new release from Habanero Gaming called Magic Oak. It's a four by four game with no paylines but with cluster wins. Experience magical gameplay that has a super-powerful Wild symbol that delivers the game's biggest prize. Additionally, Magic Oak has a progressive jackpot and a big jackpot prize, plus two smaller pots. Both can be won.

In fact, you'll see the possibility of winning the elusive leprechaun's treasure and if you do, you'll climb up to glory and power in one swift stroke. Does this sound like your kind of deal?\nWell then, don't waste any time thinking – Black Forest, a video slot game from Spearhead Studios will captivate your imagination better than most other slots. Keep on reading to learn more about this slot and how you can turn small bets into big jackpots.\nWith mesmerizing symbols, a bonus multiplier game, and a lucrative jackpot, you'll surely find everything you desire in a slot game!\nDark and Magical Graphics\nA dark yet magical forest is the first thing you'll see when you open the game. With nothing but the reels and wooden structure where the options are placed at the bottom of the reels, you can expect stunning designs. Developed in 2015, it offers the best graphics, and the music is somewhat mystical and intriguing. So, before you press the Spin button, take a look at the gameplay below and see how you can win the best rewards.\nThere are plenty of Irish-themed slots out there, and many of them have been reviewed by us here. If you browse through these Irish slots, one thing would be very clear: almost all of them try to bring into the mix the relaxed lifestyle and party culture for which Ireland is known worldwide, sometimes resorting to obvious symbols, other times taking help from the rich mythology.\nBut Black Forest is a bit different from all these other slots, as it never tries to stereotype Ireland. It chose rather to seek as much help as possible from various Gaelic myths, without ever succumbing to the pressures of commercialization. This might seem trivial, especially considering that it's a playable slot starting from a penny. But small things like these count in the long run, and we certainly have an eye for details!\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nWell, so far, everything has gone according to plan and expectations. Let's see if the gameplay has any surprises in store for us.\nLet's start by pointing out the most important parameters of the gameplay. This slot has 5 standard reels and 20 static paylines. The paylines cannot be adjusted according to your needs or requests, and this should be seen as a blessing in disguise, particularly by beginners, because it means there's one less thing to worry about. All they have to do is wager the coins and let the reels rip!\nWe would have certainly liked to see at least another ten paylines to bring some sort of uniformity in the gameplay, but the current setup is not to be disdained in any way.\nIf you're excited to explore this dark forest in search of those mythical riches, you will need to know where to hit hardest.\nThere are nine regular symbols in this game, and they're all themed – from an acorn to a spellbook, two witches and potions, mushrooms and trees, and a cauldron as standard game symbols. Typical things you might find if you stumble upon a magical forest around your city.\nThere are two special symbols that are here to spice things up in this game, and they are the Wild Card symbol which can be noticed by two ghosts circling and the bonus symbol represented by a spider.\nThere is a bonus feature in Black Forest and it's called the Spider Treasure Bonus. This is triggered by three or more bonus spider symbols and once you manage to land them, you'll be taken to a new screen where you'll need to choose between cocoons and reveal the multipliers inside them. The total of the multipliers received will be applied to your bet.\nTo make a difference, however, you'll need to make the most out of the special symbols. The Wild symbol of this slot is a mischievous leprechaun – all dressed in green, and flashing a cigar and a gold coin. The Wild – apart from taking care of the half-heart combinations – pays generously, 7500 coins for a combo of five against five.\nAs if that wasn't enough, the scatter makes things really interesting, offering an extra bounty of 2,000 coins and up to 10 free spins with a senseless 3x multiplier.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nPlay the excellent new release from Habanero Gaming called Magic Oak. It's a four by four game with no paylines but with cluster wins. Experience magical gameplay that has a super-powerful Wild symbol that delivers the game's biggest prize. Additionally, Magic Oak has a progressive jackpot and a big jackpot prize, plus two smaller pots. Both can be won. Start playing with a welcome offer that you can claim from this page.\n        ",
