            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Bondi Break\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nBondi Break is the perfect virtual environment for any experienced gambler looking to enjoy a day at an Australian-style beach. Developed by Lightning Box Games, this volatile slot game is played on a 5-reel, 25-payline game engine, but the real highlight is its free spins feature. Once triggered, players can look forward to 10 free spins, with the chance to land the Surfer Collect symbol, which pays out the total amount won during free spins. Collect up to 50 of these symbols and you could receive some spectacular rewards. Discover more in our detailed review of Bondi Break.\n\nBased on one of Australia's most popular and dangerous beaches, Bondi, Lightning Box has done an excellent job of creating a lively beach-themed mix of Australian images, surf and sand. Designed with the usual 5x3 reel setup, and with 25 paylines for potential decent wins, payouts of up to €250,000 are possible with a maximum return of up to 6,250x the stake offered.\n\nThe slot's graphics are well-suited for experienced gamblers with its surf-themed visuals. You'll see the beach, the sea and the golden sand behind the spinners, all appearing clearly enough to provide an engaging experience. The guitar soundtrack that plays while you spin may not be the most obvious choice for a surf-themed slot, but its adjustable volume adds a nice touch to the in-game experience.\n\nOn the reels, you'll encounter A to 10 royals, a straw hat, a pelican, a camper, and a surfer. These are joined by three different lifeguard symbols, each of which can be used to make a winner. The bare-chested lifeguard pays out the most, delivering 10, 20 or 200 times the wager for 3, 4 or 5 in combination. The two girls on the beach form the wild symbol, which can only appear on the three middle reels. As usual, the wild symbol replaces all standard symbols in a winning combination.\n\nThis beach adventure is available on all devices, presented in a simple yet fun gameplay style perfectly suited for experienced gamblers. The game's functions and symbols include the Girl Wild and the Bonus Scatter icon among others. Triggering the free spins feature awards players with 10 free spins and the chance to collect symbols with the Collect message that can then be converted into multiplied winnings once the feature comes to an end.\n\nWith bet sizes starting from €0.25, Bondi Break offers potential wins of up to 6,250x the stake, with a maximum bet per spin set at €40. RTP is slightly on the lower side, with the slot's volatility set at high.\n\nIf you're in the mood for some virtual beach time, Bondi Break could be just what you're looking for. Another similar option for a surf-themed slot is the NetEnt-developed Wild Water, with multipliers of up to 2,000x your bets.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\ngameplay features\ndesign and graphics\nbetting options\npayout potential\ntarget audience\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Bondi Break is the perfect virtual environment for any experienced gambler looking to enjoy a day at an Australian-style beach. Developed by Lightning Box Games, this volatile slot game is played on a 5-reel, 25-payline game engine, but the real highlight is its free spins feature. Once triggered, players can look forward to 10 free spins, with the chance to land the Surfer Collect symbol, which pays out the total amount won during free spins. Collect up to 50 of these symbols and you could receive some spectacular rewards. Discover more in our detailed review of Bondi Break.\n\nBased on one of Australia's most popular and dangerous beaches, Bondi, Lightning Box has done an excellent job of creating a lively beach-themed mix of Australian images, surf and sand. Designed with the usual 5x3 reel setup, and with 25 paylines for potential decent wins, payouts of up to €250,000 are possible with a maximum return of up to 6,250x the stake offered.\n\nThe slot's graphics are well-suited for experienced gamblers with its surf-themed visuals. You'll see the beach, the sea and the golden sand behind the spinners, all appearing clearly enough to provide an engaging experience. The guitar soundtrack that plays while you spin may not be the most obvious choice for a surf-themed slot, but its adjustable volume adds a nice touch to the in-game experience.\n\nOn the reels, you'll encounter A to 10 royals, a straw hat, a pelican, a camper, and a surfer. These are joined by three different lifeguard symbols, each of which can be used to make a winner. The bare-chested lifeguard pays out the most, delivering 10, 20 or 200 times the wager for 3, 4 or 5 in combination. The two girls on the beach form the wild symbol, which can only appear on the three middle reels. As usual, the wild symbol replaces all standard symbols in a winning combination.\n\nThis beach adventure is available on all devices, presented in a simple yet fun gameplay style perfectly suited for experienced gamblers. The game's functions and symbols include the Girl Wild and the Bonus Scatter icon among others. Triggering the free spins feature awards players with 10 free spins and the chance to collect symbols with the Collect message that can then be converted into multiplied winnings once the feature comes to an end.\n\nWith bet sizes starting from €0.25, Bondi Break offers potential wins of up to 6,250x the stake, with a maximum bet per spin set at €40. RTP is slightly on the lower side, with the slot's volatility set at high.\n\nIf you're in the mood for some virtual beach time, Bondi Break could be just what you're looking for. Another similar option for a surf-themed slot is the NetEnt-developed Wild Water, with multipliers of up to 2,000x your bets.\n            ",

Developed by Lightning Box Games, this volatile slot game is played on a 5-reel, 25-payline game engine, but the real highlight is its free spins feature. Once triggered, players can look forward to 10 free spins, with the chance to land the Surfer Collect symbol, which pays out the total amount won during free spins. Collect up to 50 of these symbols and you could receive some spectacular rewards. Discover more in our detailed review of Bondi Break.\n\nBased on one of Australia's most popular and dangerous beaches, Bondi, Lightning Box has done an excellent job of creating a lively beach-themed mix of Australian images, surf and sand. Designed with the usual 5x3 reel setup, and with 25 paylines for potential decent wins, payouts of up to €250,000 are possible with a maximum return of up to 6,250x the stake offered.\n\nThe slot's graphics are well-suited for experienced gamblers with its surf-themed visuals. You'll see the beach, the sea and the golden sand behind the spinners, all appearing clearly enough to provide an engaging experience. The guitar soundtrack that plays while you spin may not be the most obvious choice for a surf-themed slot, but its adjustable volume adds a nice touch to the in-game experience.\n\nOn the reels, you'll encounter A to 10 royals, a straw hat, a pelican, a camper, and a surfer. These are joined by three different lifeguard symbols, each of which can be used to make a winner. The bare-chested lifeguard pays out the most, delivering 10, 20 or 200 times the wager for 3, 4 or 5 in combination. The two girls on the beach form the wild symbol, which can only appear on the three middle reels. As usual, the wild symbol replaces all standard symbols in a winning combination.\n\nThis beach adventure is available on all devices, presented in a simple yet fun gameplay style perfectly suited for experienced gamblers. The game's functions and symbols include the Girl Wild and the Bonus Scatter icon among others. Triggering the free spins feature awards players with 10 free spins and the chance to collect symbols with the Collect message that can then be converted into multiplied winnings once the feature comes to an end.\n\nWith bet sizes starting from €0.25, Bondi Break offers potential wins of up to 6,250x the stake, with a maximum bet per spin set at €40. RTP is slightly on the lower side, with the slot's volatility set at high.\n\nIf you're in the mood for some virtual beach time, Bondi Break could be just what you're looking for. Another similar option for a surf-themed slot is the NetEnt-developed Wild Water, with multipliers of up to 2,000x your bets.\n            ",

Developed by Lightning Box Games, this volatile slot game is played on a 5-reel, 25-payline game engine, but the real highlight is its free spins feature. Once triggered, players can look forward to 10 free spins, with the chance to land the Surfer Collect symbol, which pays out the total amount won during free spins. Collect up to 50 of these symbols and you could receive some spectacular rewards. Discover more in our detailed review of Bondi Break.\n\nBased on one of Australia's most popular and dangerous beaches, Bondi, Lightning Box has done an excellent job of creating a lively beach-themed mix of Australian images, surf and sand. Designed with the usual 5x3 reel setup, and with 25 paylines for potential decent wins, payouts of up to €250,000 are possible with a maximum return of up to 6,250x the stake offered.\n\nThe slot's graphics are well-suited for experienced gamblers with its surf-themed visuals. You'll see the beach, the sea and the golden sand behind the spinners, all appearing clearly enough to provide an engaging experience. The guitar soundtrack that plays while you spin may not be the most obvious choice for a surf-themed slot, but its adjustable volume adds a nice touch to the in-game experience.\n\nOn the reels, you'll encounter A to 10 royals, a straw hat, a pelican, a camper, and a surfer. These are joined by three different lifeguard symbols, each of which can be used to make a winner. The bare-chested lifeguard pays out the most, delivering 10, 20 or 200 times the wager for 3, 4 or 5 in combination. The two girls on the beach form the wild symbol, which can only appear on the three middle reels. As usual, the wild symbol replaces all standard symbols in a winning combination.\n\nThis beach adventure is available on all devices, presented in a simple yet fun gameplay style perfectly suited for experienced gamblers. The game's functions and symbols include the Girl Wild and the Bonus Scatter icon among others. Triggering the free spins feature awards players with 10 free spins and the chance to collect symbols with the Collect message that can then be converted into multiplied winnings once the feature comes to an end.\n\nWith bet sizes starting from €0.25, Bondi Break offers potential wins of up to 6,250x the stake, with a maximum bet per spin set at €40. RTP is slightly on the lower side, with the slot's volatility set at high.\n\nIf you're in the mood for some virtual beach time, Bondi Break could be just what you're looking for. Another similar option for a surf-themed slot is the NetEnt-developed Wild Water, with multipliers of up to 2,000x your bets.\n            ",
