The Castle symbol is the Wild, which can appear on any reel and replace everything except the Scatter. During the base game, it can expand to fill the entire reel, and during the Free Spins feature, it transforms into an extended Sticky Wild. The mysterious Masked Lady is the Scatter and activates the Free Spins feature when three or more of them land anywhere on the reels.\n\nFree Spins and Expanding Wilds\n\nIf three or more Scatter symbols land anywhere on the reels, the Free Spins feature is triggered. Players can win up to 20 free spins during this feature, and every time a Wild lands, it will expand and become frozen in that same position for the rest of the free spins. This is known as the extended Sticky Wild feature.\n\nRandom Multipliers and Winning Potential\n\nDuring the Free Spins feature, players can also benefit from a random multiplier that can increase their winnings from 2 up to 10 times. With a maximum bet of €100.00, players have the potential to win big with the Musketeer Slot.\n\nTarget Audience and Playing Options\n\nThe Musketeer Slot is ideal for fans of Alexandre Dumas' novel and players who enjoy story-based slot games.

The main focus of the image should be a happy Maya warrior wearing glasses, with a background that depicts a castle or a medieval European town. The warrior should be holding a pistol or a crossbow, and the image should also include the three Musketeers on horseback. The color scheme should feature shades of purple, as this is the dominant color of the slot game's background. Make sure the image is eye-catching and captures the adventurous spirit of the game."
