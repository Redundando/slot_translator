The biggest cash multiplier on the bonus features is 250x.\n\nRetro Graphics\nYou'll enter an empty space full of vibrant colors and classic slot symbols. These are arranged on an unusual reel-set that can provide winning results on 10 paylines.

The overall design invites fun reel action, as No Limit City developers paid attention to detail to complete a fully retro/classic version.\n\nInnovative Gameplay\nThe game is innovative in that it offers three bonus features that are triggered not by landing scatters but by standard symbols during base gameplay. The reel set consists of a central set of three by three and two reels on its sides consisting of two rows.\n\nWe can't get enough of the graphic design of this slot. The gameplay is fully supported by the smooth rolling of the reels, with every single symbol animated. The entire reel-set on the Hot 4 Cash slot jumps and shakes with energy, so it's no wonder that No Limit City has been touted as the next big thing in online slots.\n\nThe audio theme is quite decent, producing swooshes and jingles with every action on the slots.

The payout table shows what triggers the special features, as well as the rules of the game.\n\nThe most rewarding symbol in the game is sevens.

Next is the green seven, which pays 25x, followed by the blue seven, which pays 20x.\n\nThe dynamic payout table can display the specific symbol win results when using the minus and plus buttons to change the bet size.

Triggering symbols will become wild during the entire bonus, and if you land other triggering symbols, they will also become sticky wilds.\n\nLanding four of the same types of symbols, which can be of different colors, will trigger the Colossal Spins. In this case, the central reel becomes a single huge symbol, and the sides spin. This is a two-way pay game.\n\nThis bonus occurs when four of the same colors land in the hot zones. They can be different symbols but must be the same color. In this case, the player can spin the Wheel of Fortune. If the wedge stops on the UP sign, you move on to the larger wheel. Each of the three wheels has a higher set of multipliers.

The reel set consists of a central 3 by 3 set and two reels on its sides consisting of two rows.\n\nWe can never get enough of the graphical design of this slot. The gameplay is fully supported by the regular rolling of the reels and every single symbol is animated. The entire reel-set on the Hot 4 Cash slots jumps and shakes with energy, so it's no wonder that No Limit City has been advertised as the next big thing in online slots.\n\nThe audio theme is decent enough, launching swooshes and jingles at every action on the slots. So, overall, every player should have a world of fun while enjoying this release, no matter if playing with the smallest bet or aiming for a higher stakes game.\n\nFor a retro slot, players will find more features than usual. Especially the corner blocks on the central reel, where landing on a specific combination of symbols and colors will trigger one of the Hot 4 Cash slot's three features.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nTo view the pay symbol, access the paytable from the game menu in the bottom right corner. The paytable shows what triggers the special features, as well as the game rules.\n\nThe most profitable symbol in the game is the sevens. These are available in three colors, of which the red pays out the most, at 30x multiplied by the winning bet, when five of the same fall on a line. The next is the green seven, which pays out 25x and is followed by the blue seven, which pays out 20x.\n\nThe dynamic paytable can display the specific symbol win results when using the plus and minus buttons to change the bet size. The biggest base game win comes from five red sevens that pay out 3000 euros when the maximum bet is 100.00 euros.\n\nThe rest of the symbols are gems that come in three colors and the cherry symbol, which also comes in red, green and blue.\n\nThe wild symbol replaces any other symbol, given that there is no scatter on the Hot 4 Cash slots.\n\nWhen four of the same symbol land on the four Hot Zones, the game triggers seven Super Free Spins. The triggering symbols will become wilds throughout the bonus and if more triggering symbols land, they will also become sticky wilds.\n\nLand four of the same types of symbols, which can be of different colors, to trigger Colossal Spins. In this case, the central reel will become one huge symbol and the sides will spin. This is a two-way pay game.\n\nThis bonus occurs when four of the same colors land in the hot zones. They can be different symbols, but the same color is needed. In this case, the player can spin the Wheel of Fortune. If the wedge lands on the UP sign, you move to the next bigger wheel. Each of the three wheels has a set of higher multipliers. The biggest prize is 250x on the triggering bet.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\n\nIf you liked the design and feel of the Hot 4 Cash slot, the good news is that it's similar to a couple of other great games, such as the Space Arcade video slot, which also comes from NoLimit City. It's a 3-reel, 9-line slot with abstract colored symbols and winning multipliers.\n\nThe Neon Staxx slot by NetEnt is another game that has in common with the Hot 4 Cash slot machine. This futuristic slot boasts high-quality graphics and a rewarding stacked symbols feature."

This is the deal on the Hot 4 Cash slot by Nolimit City. The game can offer a maximum payout of 30x on the most profitable symbol, in addition to three bonus features triggered in an innovative way, using the Hot Zones. The biggest cash multiplier on the bonus features is 250x.\n\nA retro graphic\n\nYou are on the threshold of an empty space full of vivid colors and classic slot symbols. These are arranged on an unusual reel-set capable of providing winning results on 10 paylines. In addition to the novelty in design, the Hot 4 Cash slot offers a decent payout, few bonus features and something called Hot Zones. The overall design invites for fun reel action, given that No Limit City developers have paid attention to detail to complete a retro/classic full version.\n\nThe game is innovative, for a change, as it offers three bonus features that are activated not by landing scatters, but by standard game symbols during the base game. The reel set consists of a central 3 by 3 set and two reels on its sides consisting of two rows.\n\nWe can never get enough of the graphical design of this slot. The gameplay is fully supported by the regular rolling of the reels and every single symbol is animated. The entire reel-set on the Hot 4 Cash slots jumps and shakes with energy, so it's no wonder that No Limit City has been advertised as the next big thing in online slots.\n\nThe audio theme is decent enough, launching swooshes and jingles at every action on the slots. So, overall, every player should have a world of fun while enjoying this release, no matter if playing with the smallest bet or aiming for a higher stakes game.\n\nFor a retro slot, players will find more features than usual. Especially the corner blocks on the central reel, where landing on a specific combination of symbols and colors will trigger one of the Hot 4 Cash slot's three features.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nTo view the pay symbol, access the paytable from the game menu in the bottom right corner. The paytable shows what triggers the special features, as well as the game rules.\n\nThe most profitable symbol in the game is the sevens. These are available in three colors, of which the red pays out the most, at 30x multiplied by the winning bet, when five of the same fall on a line. The next is the green seven, which pays out 25x and is followed by the blue seven, which pays out 20x.\n\nThe dynamic paytable can display the specific symbol win results when using the plus and minus buttons to change the bet size. The biggest base game win comes from five red sevens that pay out 3000 euros when the maximum bet is 100.00 euros.\n\nThe rest of the symbols are gems that come in three colors and the cherry symbol, which also comes in red, green and blue.\n\nThe wild symbol replaces any other symbol, given that there is no scatter on the Hot 4 Cash slots.\n\nWhen four of the same symbol land on the four Hot Zones, the game triggers seven Super Free Spins. The triggering symbols will become wilds throughout the bonus and if more triggering symbols land, they will also become sticky wilds.\n\nLand four of the same types of symbols, which can be of different colors, to trigger Colossal Spins.

The central reels have three rows while the rest have two rows. The game has a unique design and offers a decent payout, three bonus features, and Hot Zones which trigger the bonus rounds. The Hot 4 Cash slot is different from typical slots as it offers features that are activated by standard game symbols during the base game.\n\nPayout values and symbols\n\nThe most profitable symbol in the game is the red seven that pays out at 30x multiplied by the winning bet when five of the same fall on a line. The other two seven symbols come in green and blue colors and pay out 25x and 20x respectively. The wild symbol replaces any other symbol, and the game does not feature any scatter symbols. Besides the sevens, the game has gems that come in three colors and the cherry symbol, which also comes in red, green, and blue.\n\nBonus features\n\nHot 4 Cash features three bonus rounds that can be triggered by landing symbols in the Hot Zones. The three bonus rounds are the Super Free Spins, Colossal Spins, and Wheel of Fortune. Super Free Spins are triggered by landing four of the same symbols on the four Hot Zones. Colossal Spins are activated when four of the same symbols land on the reels, and the central reel becomes one massive symbol. The Wheel of Fortune feature requires players to land four symbols of the same color in the Hot Zones. The biggest cash multiplier on the bonus features is 250x.\n\nGame design and audio\n\nThe Hot 4 Cash slot has a retro design with vivid colors and classic slot symbols. The game's reel-set is unusual and provides winning results on 10 paylines. The graphics are animated, and attention has been paid to every detail to provide an immersive retro/classic full version experience. The audio theme is decent, with swooshes and jingles launched at every action on the slots. The overall design invites players for fun reel action, and it's no wonder that No Limit City developers have been advertised as the next big thing in online slots.\n\nWild and scatter symbols\n\nThe game features a wild symbol that replaces all other symbols in the game. There are no scatter symbols in the game.\n\nSuper Free Spins\n\nThe Super Free Spins feature is triggered by landing four of the same symbol on the four Hot Zones. During the Super Free Spins, the triggering symbols become wild, and if more triggering symbols land, they become sticky wilds. Players get seven Super Free Spins.\n\nSimilar slot game recommendations\n\nIf you like the Hot 4 Cash slot game, there are other great games with similar gameplay and design. One such game is the Space Arcade video slot from Nolimit City which has 3 reels and 9 paylines with abstract colored symbols and winning multipliers. Another game with similarities is the Neon Staxx slot by NetEnt. This futuristic slot boasts high-quality graphics and a rewarding stacked symbols feature.\n\n        \n            ",

The game has a central reel set of 3 by 3 with two rows on its sides. Hot 4 Cash has a unique innovation, as it offers three bonus features that are triggered by standard game symbols during the base game. The bonus features are Colossal Free Spins, Super Free Spins, and a Wheel of Fortune.\n\nPayouts and Bonuses\n\nThe red-colored sevens are the most profitable symbol, paying out 30x multiplied by the winning bet when five of the same fall on a line. The second most profitable is the green seven, which pays out 25x, followed by the blue seven that pays out 20x. The Wild symbol replaces any other symbol but does not have a Scatter symbol.

The game features a vivid color scheme that complements the electric theme of the slots. The animation of the symbols on the reels is engaging, making for exciting gameplay that players will enjoy. The audio theme complements the gameplay by launching swooshes and jingles with every action on the slots.\n\nMost Profitable Symbols\n\nThe Sevens are the most profitable symbols in Hot 4 Cash.

The other colors of Seven also payout well, with the green paying out 25x and the blue paying out 20x. There are also gems in three colors, and each color of the cherry symbol pays out differently.\n\nWild Symbol and Scatter\n\nThe Wild symbol in Hot 4 Cash replaces any other symbol but does not have a Scatter symbol. Land four identical symbols on the four Hot Zones to trigger Super Free Spins, which will reward players with seven free spins. If four of the same symbols, regardless of color, land in the Hot Zones, players trigger Colossal Free Spins. In this case, the central reel will become one huge symbol, and the sides will spin, with a two-way pay game. There is no Scatter symbol.\n\nSuper Free Spins and Wheel of Fortune\n\nSuper Free Spins is one of the three bonus features in Hot 4 Cash, which is triggered when four of the same symbols land on the four Hot Zones. The triggering symbols will become wilds throughout the bonus, and any more triggering symbols that land will also become sticky wilds. Another bonus feature is the Colossal Free Spins that is triggered when four of the same types of symbols, regardless of the color, land in the Hot Zones. The third feature is the Wheel of Fortune that is triggered when four of the same colors land in the hot zones. The wedge on the wheel can land on the UP sign, which moves a player to the next bigger wheel. Each of the three wheels has a set of higher multipliers, with the biggest prize being 250x on the triggering bet.\n\nSimilar Games by NetEnt\n\nHot 4 Cash has similar gameplay and design to NetEnt's Neon Staxx slot, which is a futuristic slot game with rewarding stacked symbol features. Another game that players might find to be similar to Hot 4 Cash is NetEnt's Space Arcade video slot that boasts abstract-colored symbols and winning multipliers.\n\n        \n            ",

This is the deal on the Hot 4 Cash slot by Nolimit City. The game can offer a maximum payout of 30x on the most profitable symbol, in addition to three bonus features triggered in an innovative way, using the Hot Zones. The biggest cash multiplier on the bonus features is 250x.\n\nA retro graphic\n\nYou are on the threshold of an empty space full of vivid colors and classic slot symbols. These are arranged on an unusual reel-set capable of providing winning results on 10 paylines. In addition to the novelty in design, the Hot 4 Cash slot offers a decent payout, few bonus features and something called Hot Zones. The overall design invites for fun reel action, given that No Limit City developers have paid attention to detail to complete a retro/classic full version.\n\nThe game is innovative, for a change, as it offers three bonus features that are activated not by landing scatters, but by standard game symbols during the base game. The reel set consists of a central 3 by 3 set and two reels on its sides consisting of two rows.\n\nWe can never get enough of the graphical design of this slot. The gameplay is fully supported by the regular rolling of the reels and every single symbol is animated. The entire reel-set on the Hot 4 Cash slots jumps and shakes with energy, so it's no wonder that No Limit City has been advertised as the next big thing in online slots.\n\nThe audio theme is decent enough, launching swooshes and jingles at every action on the slots. So, overall, every player should have a world of fun while enjoying this release, no matter if playing with the smallest bet or aiming for a higher stakes game.\n\nFor a retro slot, players will find more features than usual. Especially the corner blocks on the central reel, where landing on a specific combination of symbols and colors will trigger one of the Hot 4 Cash slot's three features.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nTo view the pay symbol, access the paytable from the game menu in the bottom right corner. The paytable shows what triggers the special features, as well as the game rules.\n\nThe most profitable symbol in the game is the sevens. These are available in three colors, of which the red pays out the most, at 30x multiplied by the winning bet, when five of the same fall on a line. The next is the green seven, which pays out 25x and is followed by the blue seven, which pays out 20x.\n\nThe dynamic paytable can display the specific symbol win results when using the plus and minus buttons to change the bet size. The biggest base game win comes from five red sevens that pay out 3000 euros when the maximum bet is 100.00 euros.\n\nThe rest of the symbols are gems that come in three colors and the cherry symbol, which also comes in red, green and blue.\n\nThe wild symbol replaces any other symbol, given that there is no scatter on the Hot 4 Cash slots.\n\nWhen four of the same symbol land on the four Hot Zones, the game triggers seven Super Free Spins. The triggering symbols will become wilds throughout the bonus and if more triggering symbols land, they will also become sticky wilds.\n\nLand four of the same types of symbols, which can be of different colors, to trigger Colossal Spins. In this case, the central reel will become one huge symbol and the sides will spin. This is a two-way pay game.\n\nThis bonus occurs when four of the same colors land in the hot zones. They can be different symbols, but the same color is needed. In this case, the player can spin the Wheel of Fortune. If the wedge lands on the UP sign, you move to the next bigger wheel.

This is the deal on the Hot 4 Cash slot by Nolimit City. The game can offer a maximum payout of 30x on the most profitable symbol, in addition to three bonus features triggered in an innovative way, using the Hot Zones. The biggest cash multiplier on the bonus features is 250x.\n\nA retro graphic\n\nYou are on the threshold of an empty space full of vivid colors and classic slot symbols. These are arranged on an unusual reel-set capable of providing winning results on 10 paylines. In addition to the novelty in design, the Hot 4 Cash slot offers a decent payout, few bonus features and something called Hot Zones. The overall design invites for fun reel action, given that No Limit City developers have paid attention to detail to complete a retro/classic full version.\n\nThe game is innovative, for a change, as it offers three bonus features that are activated not by landing scatters, but by standard game symbols during the base game. The reel set consists of a central 3 by 3 set and two reels on its sides consisting of two rows.\n\nWe can never get enough of the graphical design of this slot. The gameplay is fully supported by the regular rolling of the reels and every single symbol is animated. The entire reel-set on the Hot 4 Cash slots jumps and shakes with energy, so it's no wonder that No Limit City has been advertised as the next big thing in online slots.\n\nThe audio theme is decent enough, launching swooshes and jingles at every action on the slots. So, overall, every player should have a world of fun while enjoying this release, no matter if playing with the smallest bet or aiming for a higher stakes game.\n\nFor a retro slot, players will find more features than usual. Especially the corner blocks on the central reel, where landing on a specific combination of symbols and colors will trigger one of the Hot 4 Cash slot's three features.\n\nFunctions and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nTo view the pay symbol, access the paytable from the game menu in the bottom right corner. The paytable shows what triggers the special features, as well as the game rules.\n\nThe most profitable symbol in the game is the sevens. These are available in three colors, of which the red pays out the most, at 30x multiplied by the winning bet, when five of the same fall on a line. The next is the green seven, which pays out 25x and is followed by the blue seven, which pays out 20x.\n\nThe dynamic paytable can display the specific symbol win results when using the plus and minus buttons to change the bet size. The biggest base game win comes from five red sevens that pay out 3000 euros when the maximum bet is 100.00 euros.\n\nThe rest of the symbols are gems that come in three colors and the cherry symbol, which also comes in red, green and blue.\n\nThe wild symbol replaces any other symbol, given that there is no scatter on the Hot 4 Cash slots.\n\nWhen four of the same symbol land on the four Hot Zones, the game triggers seven Super Free Spins. The triggering symbols will become wilds throughout the bonus and if more triggering symbols land, they will also become sticky wilds.\n\nLand four of the same types of symbols, which can be of different colors, to trigger Colossal Spins. In this case, the central reel will become one huge symbol and the sides will spin. This is a two-way pay game.\n\nThis bonus occurs when four of the same colors land in the hot zones. They can be different symbols, but the same color is needed. In this case, the player can spin the Wheel of Fortune. If the wedge lands on the UP sign, you move to the next bigger wheel. Each of the three wheels has a set of higher multipliers. The biggest prize is 250x on the triggering bet.\n\nOther similar Slot Machines\n\nIf you liked the design and feel of the Hot 4 Cash slot, the good news is that it's similar to a couple of other great games, such as the Space Arcade video slot, which also comes from NoLimit City. It's a 3-reel, 9-line slot with abstract colored symbols and winning multipliers.\n\nThe Neon Staxx slot by NetEnt is another game that has in common with the Hot 4 Cash slot machine.
