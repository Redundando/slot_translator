La vicenda si svolge in un regno fantastico popolato da draghi, mostri di pietra e una donna con poteri magici che regala moltiplicatori e altre Bonus! Il nostro eroe deve riuscire a sconfiggere i nemici per accaparrarsi le preziosissime pietre del drago, un’impresa per nulla facile. Prima di addentrarci nei meccanismi di gioco, è doveroso partire dalla grafica. Come da tradizione, la Playtech fa un lavoro incredibile per regalare un’esperienza unica ai suoi giocatori. I simboli dettagliati e le animazioni a seguito delle vincite sono un surplus che non passa di certo inosservato. Sotto la griglia di gioco si trovano tutte le impostazioni per aumentare o diminuire la nostra puntata, il tasto per avviare l’Autoplay e il tasto Start.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nLa griglia di gioco ha un taglio tradizionale, con 5 rulli e tre righe. In Kingdom Rise: Legend of Elvestone si gioca su 10 linee di pagamento fisse, con la puntata minima di 0,10 €, la massima di 500 € e la possibilità di impostare da 5 sino a un massimo di 100 giri automatici, grazie alla funzionalità Autoplay. La volatilità è media mentre il valore RTP è di 92,85%, decisamente poco soddisfacente!\nSimboli e funzionalità di Kingdom Rise: Legend of Elvestone\nIl pezzo forte di questa slot è senza dubbio il gameplay, con un sistema di gioco che può portare a raggiungere vincite di assoluto valore. Cominciamo col dare uno sguardo ai simboli. Le pietre del drago sono quelle che hanno il valore minore, seguiti dall’elmo del guerriero e dallo scudo con la spada. Con l’uomo roccia e la donna le vincite si fanno più interessanti, anche se a pagare più di tutti è il guerriero. Per movimentare il gioco c’è però bisogno del simbolo Wild Drop, una lente che può comparire sui rulli o sulla cornice. La sua funzione è quella di trasformare i simboli su cui si posa in Wild. Ad ogni giro, la lente scende di uno slot, ma se compare sopra il guerriero, allora si sposta sulla prima fila del rullo successivo. Se il Wild Drop si posa sulla donna, allora avremo diritto a un moltiplicatore x1, inoltre il simbolo speciale rimarrà nella sua posizione senza quindi scalare verso il basso. Se la lente si poserà sull’uomo di roccia, allora comparirò un nuovo Wild Drop sul simbolo successivo. Il simbolo speciale è però il drago, che può occupare da uno a 4 slot sui rulli 1 e 5. Quando accade, vengono assegnati 3 Respins durante i quali può comparire il simbolo occhio di drago. In tal caso vedremo l’occhio trasformarsi in una moneta d’oro e restare in. quella posizione per il resto dei Respins.\nDurante il gioco è possibile poi accumulare gettoni che potranno essere usati per acquistare diversi giochi e livelli della serie Kingdom Rise. Ci basterà cliccare sulla mappa alla destra della griglia di gioco e scegliere l’ambientazione che più ci piace.\n",

Created by Playtech, Kingdoms Rise: Legend of Elvenstone is a fantasy-themed slot game that adds to the other chapters of the series. The story takes place in a magical kingdom populated by dragons, stone monsters, and a woman with magical powers that gives multipliers and other bonuses! Our hero must defeat his enemies to acquire the precious dragon stones, a mission that is by no means easy. Before delving into the game mechanics, it is essential to start with the graphics. As usual, Playtech does an incredible job to provide a unique experience to its players. The detailed symbols and animations following the wins are a bonus that is not overlooked. Below the game grid, there are all the settings to increase or decrease our bet, the button to start Autoplay, and the Start button.\n\nThe game grid has a traditional cut, with 5 reels and three rows. In Kingdoms Rise: Legend of Elvenstone, you play on 10 fixed paylines, with a minimum bet of €0.10, a maximum of €500, and the possibility of setting from 5 up to a maximum of 100 automatic spins, thanks to the Autoplay function. The volatility is medium while the RTP value is 92.85%, which is not very satisfying!\n\nThe highlight of this slot is undoubtedly the gameplay, with a game system that can lead to reaching valuable wins. Let's start by taking a look at the symbols. The dragon stones are the ones with the lowest value, followed by the warrior's helmet and the shield with the sword. With the rock man and the woman, the wins become more interesting, although the warrior pays the most. To make the game more exciting, there is a need for the Wild Drop symbol, a lens that can appear on the reels or on the frame. Its function is to transform the symbols on which it lands into wilds. At each spin, the lens moves down one slot, but if it appears above the warrior, it then moves to the first row of the next reel. If the Wild Drop lands on the woman, we will be entitled to a x1 multiplier, and the special symbol will remain in its position without scaling down. If the lens lands on the rock man, then a new Wild Drop will appear on the next symbol. However, the special symbol is the dragon, which can occupy from one to 4 slots on reels 1 and 5. When this happens, three respins are awarded, during which the dragon's eye symbol can appear. In that case, we will see the eye transform into a gold coin and remain in that position for the rest of the respins.\n\nDuring the game, it is also possible to accumulate tokens that can be used to purchase different games and levels of the Kingdoms Rise series. We just need to click on the map to the right of the game grid and choose the setting that we like the most.\n            ",

Created by Playtech, Kingdoms Rise: Legend of Elvenstone is a fantasy-themed slot game that adds to the other chapters of the series. The story takes place in a magical kingdom populated by dragons, stone monsters, and a woman with magical powers that gives multipliers and other bonuses! Our hero must defeat his enemies to acquire the precious dragon stones, a mission that is by no means easy. Before delving into the game mechanics, it is essential to start with the graphics. As usual, Playtech does an incredible job to provide a unique experience to its players. The detailed symbols and animations following the wins are a bonus that is not overlooked. Below the game grid, there are all the settings to increase or decrease our bet, the button to start Autoplay, and the Start button.\n\nThe game grid has a traditional cut, with 5 reels and three rows. In Kingdoms Rise: Legend of Elvenstone, you play on 10 fixed paylines, with a minimum bet of €0.10, a maximum of €500, and the possibility of setting from 5 up to a maximum of 100 automatic spins, thanks to the Autoplay function. The volatility is medium while the RTP value is 92.85%, which is not very satisfying!\n\nThe highlight of this slot is undoubtedly the gameplay, with a game system that can lead to reaching valuable wins. Let's start by taking a look at the symbols. The dragon stones are the ones with the lowest value, followed by the warrior's helmet and the shield with the sword. With the rock man and the woman, the wins become more interesting, although the warrior pays the most. To make the game more exciting, there is a need for the Wild Drop symbol, a lens that can appear on the reels or on the frame. Its function is to transform the symbols on which it lands into wilds. At each spin, the lens moves down one slot, but if it appears above the warrior, it then moves to the first row of the next reel. If the Wild Drop lands on the woman, we will be entitled to a x1 multiplier, and the special symbol will remain in its position without scaling down. If the lens lands on the rock man, then a new Wild Drop will appear on the next symbol. However, the special symbol is the dragon, which can occupy from one to 4 slots on reels 1 and 5. When this happens, three respins are awarded, during which the dragon's eye symbol can appear. In that case, we will see the eye transform into a gold coin and remain in that position for the rest of the respins.\n\nDuring the game, it is also possible to accumulate tokens that can be used to purchase different games and levels of the Kingdoms Rise series. We just need to click on the map to the right of the game grid and choose the setting that we like the most.\n            ",

Created by Playtech, Kingdoms Rise: Legend of Elvenstone is a fantasy-themed slot game that adds to the other chapters of the series. The story takes place in a magical kingdom populated by dragons, stone monsters, and a woman with magical powers that gives multipliers and other bonuses! Our hero must defeat his enemies to acquire the precious dragon stones, a mission that is by no means easy. Before delving into the game mechanics, it is essential to start with the graphics. As usual, Playtech does an incredible job to provide a unique experience to its players. The detailed symbols and animations following the wins are a bonus that is not overlooked. Below the game grid, there are all the settings to increase or decrease our bet, the button to start Autoplay, and the Start button.\n\nThe game grid has a traditional cut, with 5 reels and three rows. In Kingdoms Rise: Legend of Elvenstone, you play on 10 fixed paylines, with a minimum bet of €0.10, a maximum of €500, and the possibility of setting from 5 up to a maximum of 100 automatic spins, thanks to the Autoplay function. The volatility is medium while the RTP value is 92.85%, which is not very satisfying!\n\nThe highlight of this slot is undoubtedly the gameplay, with a game system that can lead to reaching valuable wins. Let's start by taking a look at the symbols. The dragon stones are the ones with the lowest value, followed by the warrior's helmet and the shield with the sword. With the rock man and the woman, the wins become more interesting, although the warrior pays the most. To make the game more exciting, there is a need for the Wild Drop symbol, a lens that can appear on the reels or on the frame. Its function is to transform the symbols on which it lands into wilds. At each spin, the lens moves down one slot, but if it appears above the warrior, it then moves to the first row of the next reel. If the Wild Drop lands on the woman, we will be entitled to a x1 multiplier, and the special symbol will remain in its position without scaling down. If the lens lands on the rock man, then a new Wild Drop will appear on the next symbol. However, the special symbol is the dragon, which can occupy from one to 4 slots on reels 1 and 5. When this happens, three respins are awarded, during which the dragon's eye symbol can appear. In that case, we will see the eye transform into a gold coin and remain in that position for the rest of the respins.\n\nDuring the game, it is also possible to accumulate tokens that can be used to purchase different games and levels of the Kingdoms Rise series. We just need to click on the map to the right of the game grid and choose the setting that we like the most.\n        ",
