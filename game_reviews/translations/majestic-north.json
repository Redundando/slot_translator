During the base game, players can use the Function Enhancement button to enhance one or more symbols. The Canadian symbol is the Scatter and landing 3, 4 or 5 of them triggers 10, 15 or 20 Free Spins, respectively. During the bonus game, a special function that transforms symbols into Grizzly bears is active. The game also has 4 icons next to the grid, each with a counter with 6 positions below. Whenever the wooden mask of the bear lands on the reels, one position underneath the animals is filled. When the counter is complete, two Free Spins are added.\n\nBetting Options\n\nMajestic North has an excellent range of betting options suitable for every player. The minimum bet is €0.20, and the maximum bet is €200 per spin, with the game featuring 1024 ways to win. Players can use the Quick Spin function to speed up the rotation of the reels, and Autoplay sets a number of automatic spins between 10 and 500.\n\nVolatility\n\nMajestic North has a low volatility, which means that although it pays out often, the payouts are not always high figures. This makes the slot game suited for both cautious and more daring players alike.\n\nRTP\n\nMajestic North has a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.05%, which is excellent for a low volatility slot. This ensures that players can expect payouts that are both frequent and fair.\n\n        \n            ",

The game grid, surrounded by a wooden frame, rests on a stream of clear water, surrounded by tall firs and watched over by the immense snow-covered peaks of Majestic Mountains.\nGreat work has been done on the symbols, the animals are so well drawn they seem to come to life. The Start button is actually a ring with which to vary the bet, access automatic spins and the menu.\nFeatures of Majestic North\nThe first thing to do to play is to decide the scope of our bet. No need to panic, because Majestic North offers an excellent range of bets that adapts to every type of player. They range from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €200 per Spin. The grid has 5 reels and 4 rows, so each Spin will see 20 symbols land. The ways to win are 1024!\nAmong the various functions, we find Quick Spin, which speeds up the rotation of the reels and Autoplay, which allows you to set a number of automatic spins between 10 and 500.\nThe volatility is low, so the game pays often but always not too high figures. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.05%.\nHow to win\nAs in all slots, we also face low value and high value symbols here. The poker royals belong to the first group, from nine to ace, while in the second group we find the owl, the bald eagle, the Canadian reindeer, the wolf and the Grizzly bear.\nThe Canadian symbol is the Scatter and 3, 4 or 5 are required to receive 10, 15 or 20 Free Spins, respectively. During the bonus game, the special function that transforms the symbols into Grizzly bears is active. Next to the grid there are 4 icons: the wolf, the Canadian reindeer, the bald eagle, and the owl, each with a counter with 6 positions below.\nEvery time the wooden mask of the bear lands on the reels, one position underneath the animals is filled. When the counter is complete, two Free Spins are added.\nDuring the base game, by clicking on the Function Enhancement button, you can enhance one or more symbols.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the minimum and maximum bet?\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.20, the maximum is €200.\n\nCan I try the slot before betting real money?\n\nOf course, the DEMO version is available on our website, allowing you to test the game entirely for free and for as long as you need.\n\nWhere can I play Majestic North?\n\nThis slot is available in all legal online casinos, therefore certified by AAMS.\n        ",
