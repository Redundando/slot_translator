We have lost count of the similar games from any provider and of any type: there are those based on Cleopatra, those styled after Indiana Jones where treasures are buried in ancient and cursed tombs, and those where the pharaoh figure rules. The question that arises spontaneously is whether there can still be a slot machine that can be considered in any way original even though it deals with this theme. The answer is no, we cannot applaud originality for any game set in the shadow of the pyramids. Instead, we tend to see Egyptian themed slots as the modern equivalent of Fruit Machines, where fruits are replaced by hieroglyphics, and therefore consider them as basic games suitable for players who do not like to change and, depending on the gameplay, for beginners.\n\nBeat The Beast: Mighty Sphinx, produced by the software house Thunderkick, is a classic slot, graphically simple but quite impressive. In short, nothing new or special, but still a fun and well-designed game in which the Sphinx takes on dark characteristics and becomes the protagonist.

This slot game is a classic with a simple setup of five reels, three rows, and nine fixed pay lines. It may not have all the bells and whistles of some other games, but that does not mean it is any less enjoyable. Sometimes, it is the simplicity of a game that makes it great.</p><br><p>Wins are obtained with combinations of three or more identical symbols on adjacent reels, and the mighty Sphinx is the symbol to look out for. As the king of the desert, he offers the biggest payouts. With high volatility in this game, it's worth sticking around for the big potential payouts. A maximum prize of 4,444 coins may seem modest in comparison to some games, but it makes it more ideal for beginner players who are looking to get their paws wet in the world of online slots.</p><br><p>One feature that is worth mentioning is the Bonus Game. When three or more Scatter symbols land on the reels, players are transported to a secret chamber where treasures await. Spin the wheel of fortune for your chance to win up to 100 times more than your original bet. But be warned, the Sphinx is known for his feline tricks and you may not always come out on top.</p>\"\n}"

We have lost count of the similar games from any provider and of any type: there are those based on Cleopatra, those styled after Indiana Jones where treasures are buried in ancient and cursed tombs, and those where the pharaoh figure rules. The question that arises spontaneously is whether there can still be a slot machine that can be considered in any way original even though it deals with this theme. The answer is no, we cannot applaud originality for any game set in the shadow of the pyramids. Instead, we tend to see Egyptian themed slots as the modern equivalent of Fruit Machines, where fruits are replaced by hieroglyphics, and therefore consider them as basic games suitable for players who do not like to change and, depending on the gameplay, for beginners.\n\nBeat The Beast: Mighty Sphinx, produced by the software house Thunderkick, is a classic slot, graphically simple but quite impressive. In short, nothing new or special, but still a fun and well-designed game in which the Sphinx takes on dark characteristics and becomes the protagonist. Dedicated to those who love tradition.\n\nMain Features of the Slot\nBeat The Beast: Mighty Sphinx is a slot also from the gameplay point of view without infamy and without praise.

Even the wins are obtained in a classic way, with combinations of three or more identical symbols on adjacent reels starting from left to right.\n\nMore experienced players might find Beat The Beast: Mighty Sphinx a bit boring, while beginners will have the opportunity to get to know the world of slots in an easy way thanks to this game.\n\nThe volatility of Beat The Beast: Mighty Sphinx is high and the maximum prize that can be won is 4,444 coins.\n\nThe theoretical return to the player is interesting, exceeding 96%, slightly above average.\n\nSymbols and Features of Beat The Beast: Mighty Sphinx\nBeat The Beast: Mighty Sphinx associates with the symbols related to the theme of Ancient Egypt the so-called royal cards, that is, the playing cards from 9 to Ace, which are the icons of lower value.\n\nTo obtain slightly more substantial prizes, you will have to look for symbols that represent the various representations of the Sphinx.\n\nThere is a Wild symbol, identified by a W on a purple background: in this slot machine, the Wild not only has a classic function as a joker, replacing all other symbols to complete a winning combination, but also has the function of a Scatter, allowing access to the only special feature of the game, which is free spins, where all wins will be assigned a multiplier of up to 200 times the value of the bet.\n\nExperience the mystery and thrill of Ancient Egypt with Beat the Beast Mighty Sphinx, a classic slot game that offers a high volatility experience and a chance to win big.
