The total bet per spin ranges from 0.20 € to 40 €, with a token value between 0.01 € and 2 €. There are two progressive jackpots, Golden and Silver, with their value increasing as the bet increases. The theoretical return to player is an impressive 97.35%.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nThe game's overarching vampire theme is consistent throughout, with symbols that are entirely thematic. The graphics and design of Blood Night are incredibly immersive and detailed, with a dark shade and rich atmosphere. The game is set at night in a cemetery, with the reels in the center and settings buttons at the bottom, entrenched as if underground. The symbols are reproduced with great graphical accuracy, including magic potions, garlic clove, gravestones, hammer with a stake, gun on a red cushion, anatomical heart, and a skull with a candle.\n\nProgressive Jackpots\n\nBlood Night allows players to win two progressive jackpots - the Golden and Silver jackpots - each randomly assigned and increasing in value with the bet. Players can win one of these two jackpots on any spin, regardless of the game outcome or the amount bet.\n\nPaylines and Bet Limits\n\nBlood Night features twenty pay lines, where one can bet a minimum coin size of 0.01 € and a maximum coin size of 2 €. The total bet per spin ranges from 0.20 € to 40 €.\n\nReturn to Player\n\nBlood Night's theoretical return to player is an excellent 97.35%, which is significantly higher than average. This means that on average, players can expect to win back 97.35 € for every 100 € they wager over time.\n\n        \n            ",

The total amount of the bet per spin ranges from a minimum of twenty cents to a maximum of 40 €, with a token value that ranges from just one cent to 2 €.\n\nWith Blood Night, it is possible to win two progressive jackpots, the Golden Jackpot and the Silver Jackpot, randomly assigned and whose value increases as the bet increases.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting the theoretical return to player, which is really high in this case, reaching an excellent 97.35%, significantly higher than average!\n\nSymbols of Blood Night\n\nThe symbols that alternate on the reels of Blood Night are entirely thematic and include: magic potions, two garlic cloves that scare vampires away, a gravestone, a hammer with a stake, a gun on a red cushion, an anatomical heart, and a skull with a candle.\n\nThe Wild symbol is a gravestone, it acts as a wild card, and can replace all other symbols except Scatter and Bonus, but it can also form winning combinations by itself.\n\nThe Scatter is represented by swords and when it appears at least three times, it allows access to free spins in which it also gives multipliers, up to a maximum of x150!\n\nIn addition to Wild and Scatter, among the special symbols there is also the Bonus, which is the image of a book: if at least three of them appear, you will have access to a mini game of cards with which you can try to take home extra winnings.\n        ",

The image should prominently feature a Maya warrior wearing glasses with a happy expression on their face, set against a background of a cemetery at night with bats flying around. Try to incorporate some of the game's symbols, such as the gravestone, garlic cloves, and magic potions, into the image. Use a color scheme that matches the game's color palette, and make sure the imagery is visually striking and attention-grabbing."
