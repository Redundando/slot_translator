The atmosphere and suspense you feel in this game are quite similar to what millions of moviegoers experienced. However, the movie doesn't give you the chance to win huge prizes, while the big win at the Black Widow slot machine could change your life.\n\nIn addition to the symbols, the background and space around the reels have been designed with the theme in mind; spiderwebs fill two corners, while an old-fashioned gold frame contains the reels. All of this is visible above what looks like a rather old wallpaper.\n\nThe gameplay atmosphere is generally similar to that of horror movies, which seems quite appropriate since this video slot is based on a rather unsettling film.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nYou can trigger free spins by landing the green poison symbol on reels two, three, and four. You will then be awarded seven free spins. During the bonus round of free spins, landing the bonus symbol anywhere on reels two, three, and four will get you an extra free spin and this can be spent up to a maximum of 98 free spins.\n\nIf you land one of the male symbols in the middle position on reel three, you will receive a payout of 2.00 or 1.20, depending on the symbol in question. After each male symbol is caught in this position, the value on the respective meter will increase, up to 13 times on each meter, for each bonus. Counter values range from two to 1,000 times the total bet on the spin that triggered the bonus feature.\n\nIf you manage to land the Black Widow in the middle position on reel three, you will be paid the total value of all three meters for that spin, but the value of each meter will also increase, up to a maximum of 13 increases per meter, for each bonus. It seems that 13 is not so unlucky, at least not here.\n\nThe standard symbol with the highest value is of course the Black Widow herself, paying out a cool x50 your coin if you land five across an active payline. So if you're one of the many wondering how to win at the Black Widow slot machine, this is the way to do it, but it may be easier said than done.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nIf you chose this slot machine for the presence of spiders, and more than just arachnophobia, you're affected by arachnophilia. Then we can only recommend another slot machine based on a famous cinematic phenomenon, namely Spider Man Slot. Produced by Playtech, it offers an incredible maximum win of €10,000!",

But, the movie doesn't give you the chance to win huge prizes, whereas a big win on the Black Widow slot machine could change your life.\n\nIn addition to the symbols, even the background and space around the reels have been designed with the theme in mind; cobwebs fill two corners, while a dated gold frame contains the reels. All of this is visible on what appears to be a rather old wallpaper.\n\nThe game atmosphere is generally similar to that of horror movies, which seems quite appropriate given that this video slot is based on a rather creepy movie.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nYou can trigger free spins by landing the green poison symbol anywhere on reels two, three, and four. You'll then be awarded seven free spins. During the free spins bonus round, by landing the bonus symbol in any position on reels two, three, and four, you'll get an extra free spin and this can be spent up to a maximum of 98 free spins.\n\nIf you land one of the male symbols in the central position on reel three, you'll receive a payout of 2.00 or 1.20, depending on the symbol in question. After each male symbol is caught in this position, the value on the respective meter will increase, up to 13 times on each meter, for each bonus. Counter values range from two to 1,000 times the total bet on the spin that triggered the bonus feature.\n\nIf you manage to land the Black Widow in the central position on reel three, you'll be paid the total value of the three meters for that spin, but the value of each meter will also increase, up to a maximum of 13 increases per meter, for each bonus. It seems that 13 isn't such an unlucky number, at least not here.\n\nThe standard symbol with the highest value is, of course, the Black Widow herself, paying out a cool x50 your coin if you land five across an active pay line. So if you're one of the many wondering how to win on the Black Widow slot machine, this is the way, but it might be easier said than done.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you chose this slot machine for the presence of spiders, and more than arachnophobia, you suffer from arachnophilia, we can only recommend a slot machine about a famous cinematic phenomenon, namely Spider-Man Slot. Produced by Playtech, it offers you an incredible maximum win of €10,000!\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay mechanics\nSymbols and paytable\nBonus features\nFree spins\nComparison to similar slots\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Black Widow\nIf you're a fan of dark thriller movies, you'll definitely love slot games with these themes. Black Widow is an IGT game based on the 1987 movie of the same name, and it's just as exciting as the film. This game has five reels and 40 pay lines and is available on both mobile and desktop devices. Play Black Widow today and claim your free spins for the chance to get winning combinations and receive huge cash prizes!\n\nMysterious graphics\nIf you're a fan of dark thriller movies, you'll definitely love slot games with these themes. Black Widow slot is an IGT game based on the 1987 movie of the same name and it's just as exciting as the film. This game has five reels and 40 pay lines and is available on both mobile and desktop devices. This is certainly one of the best IGT slots.\n\nPut aside your fear of spiders because this particular game isn't so much about eight-legged creatures as it is about the female assassin character from the movie.\n\nThe atmosphere and suspense that you'll experience in this game are quite similar to what millions of moviegoers felt. But, the movie doesn't give you the chance to win huge prizes, whereas a big win on the Black Widow slot machine could change your life.\n\nIn addition to the symbols, even the background and space around the reels have been designed with the theme in mind; cobwebs fill two corners, while a dated gold frame contains the reels. All of this is visible on what appears to be a rather old wallpaper.\n\nThe game atmosphere is generally similar to that of horror movies, which seems quite appropriate given that this video slot is based on a rather creepy movie.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nYou can trigger free spins by landing the green poison symbol anywhere on reels two, three, and four. You'll then be awarded seven free spins. During the free spins bonus round, by landing the bonus symbol in any position on reels two, three, and four, you'll get an extra free spin and this can be spent up to a maximum of 98 free spins.\n\nIf you land one of the male symbols in the central position on reel three, you'll receive a payout of 2.00 or 1.20, depending on the symbol in question. After each male symbol is caught in this position, the value on the respective meter will increase, up to 13 times on each meter, for each bonus. Counter values range from two to 1,000 times the total bet on the spin that triggered the bonus feature.\n\nIf you manage to land the Black Widow in the central position on reel three, you'll be paid the total value of the three meters for that spin, but the value of each meter will also increase, up to a maximum of 13 increases per meter, for each bonus. It seems that 13 isn't such an unlucky number, at least not here.\n\nThe standard symbol with the highest value is, of course, the Black Widow herself, paying out a cool x50 your coin if you land five across an active pay line. So if you're one of the many wondering how to win on the Black Widow slot machine, this is the way, but it might be easier said than done.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you chose this slot machine for the presence of spiders, and more than arachnophobia, you suffer from arachnophilia, we can only recommend a slot machine about a famous cinematic phenomenon, namely Spider-Man Slot. Produced by Playtech, it offers you an incredible maximum win of €10,000!\n            ",

The symbols have been designed with the theme in mind, and even the background and space around the reels are reminiscent of the movie. To trigger free spins, you need to land the green poison symbol anywhere on reels two, three, and four. The game also has a bonus symbol, which can be caught in any position on reels two, three, and four. Each meter on the bonus feature counter increases up to 13 times for each bonus, with values ranging from two to 1,000 times the total bet on the spin that triggered the bonus feature. Standard symbols also have high values, with the Black Widow symbol being the highest paying one.\n\nSymbols and paytable\n\nBlack Widow slot symbols include the Black Widow herself, four men, and the playing card suits. The Black Widow symbol is the highest paying one, with a payout of x50 your coin if you land five across an active pay line. The men symbols pay out between x1.20 and x2.00 if caught in the central position on reel three. The playing card suits have lower values. The background and space around the reels have been designed with the theme in mind, with cobwebs in two corners and a dated gold frame that contains the reels.\n\nBonus features\n\nBlack Widow slot has a free spins bonus feature that is triggered by landing the green poison symbol anywhere on reels two, three, and four. You will be awarded seven free spins, and the bonus symbol can be caught in any position on reels two, three, and four for an extra free spin.

Black Widow is an IGT game based on the 1987 movie of the same name, and it's just as exciting as the film. This game has five reels and 40 pay lines and is available on both mobile and desktop devices. Play Black Widow today and claim your free spins for the chance to get winning combinations and receive huge cash prizes!\n\nMysterious graphics\nIf you're a fan of dark thriller movies, you'll definitely love slot games with these themes. Black Widow slot is an IGT game based on the 1987 movie of the same name and it's just as exciting as the film. This game has five reels and 40 pay lines and is available on both mobile and desktop devices. This is certainly one of the best IGT slots.\n\nPut aside your fear of spiders because this particular game isn't so much about eight-legged creatures as it is about the female assassin character from the movie.\n\nThe atmosphere and suspense that you'll experience in this game are quite similar to what millions of moviegoers felt. But, the movie doesn't give you the chance to win huge prizes, whereas a big win on the Black Widow slot machine could change your life.\n\nIn addition to the symbols, even the background and space around the reels have been designed with the theme in mind; cobwebs fill two corners, while a dated gold frame contains the reels. All of this is visible on what appears to be a rather old wallpaper.\n\nThe game atmosphere is generally similar to that of horror movies, which seems quite appropriate given that this video slot is based on a rather creepy movie.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nYou can trigger free spins by landing the green poison symbol anywhere on reels two, three, and four. You'll then be awarded seven free spins. During the free spins bonus round, by landing the bonus symbol in any position on reels two, three, and four, you'll get an extra free spin and this can be spent up to a maximum of 98 free spins.\n\nIf you land one of the male symbols in the central position on reel three, you'll receive a payout of 2.00 or 1.20, depending on the symbol in question. After each male symbol is caught in this position, the value on the respective meter will increase, up to 13 times on each meter, for each bonus. Counter values range from two to 1,000 times the total bet on the spin that triggered the bonus feature.\n\nIf you manage to land the Black Widow in the central position on reel three, you'll be paid the total value of the three meters for that spin, but the value of each meter will also increase, up to a maximum of 13 increases per meter, for each bonus. It seems that 13 isn't such an unlucky number, at least not here.\n\nThe standard symbol with the highest value is, of course, the Black Widow herself, paying out a cool x50 your coin if you land five across an active pay line. So if you're one of the many wondering how to win on the Black Widow slot machine, this is the way, but it might be easier said than done.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nIf you chose this slot machine for the presence of spiders, and more than arachnophobia, you suffer from arachnophilia, we can only recommend a slot machine about a famous cinematic phenomenon, namely Spider-Man Slot. Produced by Playtech, it offers you an incredible maximum win of €10,000!\n            ",
