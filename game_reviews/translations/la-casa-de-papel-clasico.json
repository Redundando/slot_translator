During these free spins, you can collect high-yield banknotes ranging from 5 to 500 credits to start building your prize.\n\nYou can also choose to buy more time and potentially more free spins with the flip gamble game.

You'll then play 3 free spins on a new set of reels. \n\nDuring the heist, the standard symbols are removed. In their place are the banknote symbols. These are available in denominations of 5x, 10x, 20x, 20x, 50x, 100x, 200x, and 500x.\n\nThese can land above, below, or on the payline. If a banknote lands on the payline, you'll win that amount as a prize. If more than one banknote lands on the payline, the amounts are added up. In theory, therefore, it's possible to land 1,500x your stake from a single spin.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nNetEnt's Scarface slot is based on the 1983 movie.

If you're not familiar with the source material, the drama follows a band of robbers trying to execute the perfect bank heist. As you'll find in our La Casa de Papel Clasico review, the gameplay is a bit unusual. The action takes place on a 3-reel machine with only one active payline. Activate the feature, and you'll spin a new set of reels. Each banknote that lands on the payline assigns up to 500x bets. You can then bet for more spins. Lose the bet, and you'll lose all your money.\n\nA Crime Genius Graphics\nThere's a fantastic range of bets to choose from when you first load up La Casa de Papel online slot. The minimum is 0.2 credits, and the maximum is 100. While there's only one payline in this game, collecting wins is easier than you might think thanks to this slot having only three reels.\n\nThe RTP for this game is 96.33%, and it has medium to high volatility.\n\nLa Casa de Papel slot is the official slot for the successful Netflix series Money Heist. It's a series of criminals who, under the brilliant instructions of the Professor, undertake the biggest robbery in the history of Spain. The series has become a global phenomenon with 4 seasons.\n\nVisually, behind the reels is a stylish black and red background. There you will see the bank and many of the characters from the series. The reels are packed in the center of the screen. It's a bit cramped, even with the 3 reels, 1 payline set up.\n\nAbove the reels, you can see the show's videos. They don't do much. We would have preferred to see the paytable permanently positioned there rather than appear and disappear as is. \n\nFunctionality and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nTo get the free spins, La Casa de Papel online slot's main special feature, you need to land the three bank parts, i.e., Scatter symbols, on the payline. Even though this might be a bit difficult to do, you can get 3 free spins for doing it. During these free spins, you can collect high-yield banknotes ranging from 5 to 500 credits to start building your prize.\n\nYou can also choose to buy more time and potentially more free spins with the flip gamble game. If you land in the red zone, your bet is lost, and you return to regular reels. Landing in the green zone will guarantee you another 3 spins. You can redeem this bonus round for up to 11 times, giving you plenty of chances to pull off an epic win.\n\nLa Casa de Papel slot game is a great option for those who love 3-reel slots and this particular TV show. Even if you have never seen the show, the gambling and free spins make it a brilliant slot to try. There are some great chances to win, and the theme is very memorable.\n\nThe Heist Bonus feature is triggered by landing 3 building symbols on the payline on the same spin. You'll then play 3 free spins on a new set of reels. \n\nDuring the heist, the standard symbols are removed. In their place are the banknote symbols. These are available in denominations of 5x, 10x, 20x, 20x, 50x, 100x, 200x, and 500x.\n\nThese can land above, below, or on the payline. If a banknote lands on the payline, you'll win that amount as a prize. If more than one banknote lands on the payline, the amounts are added up. In theory, therefore, it's possible to land 1,500x your stake from a single spin.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nNetEnt's Scarface slot is based on the 1983 movie. It has 5 reels, 20 paylines, and the chance to win big thanks to wilds, free spins, and more.

Playing La Casa de Papel online slot, you'll discover it has an action-packed gameplay and the potential to get big wins!\n\nBased on the popular Spanish Netflix drama Money Heist, La Casa de Papel slot is a Skywind crime-themed 3-reel game. If you're not familiar with the source material, the drama follows a band of robbers trying to execute the perfect bank heist. As you'll find in our La Casa de Papel Clasico review, the gameplay is a bit unusual. The action takes place on a 3-reel machine with only one active payline. Activate the feature, and you'll spin a new set of reels. Each banknote that lands on the payline assigns up to 500x bets. You can then bet for more spins. Lose the bet, and you'll lose all your money.\n\nA Crime Genius Graphics\nThere's a fantastic range of bets to choose from when you first load up La Casa de Papel online slot. The minimum is 0.2 credits, and the maximum is 100. While there's only one payline in this game, collecting wins is easier than you might think thanks to this slot having only three reels.\n\nThe RTP for this game is 96.33%, and it has medium to high volatility.\n\nLa Casa de Papel slot is the official slot for the successful Netflix series Money Heist. It's a series of criminals who, under the brilliant instructions of the Professor, undertake the biggest robbery in the history of Spain. The series has become a global phenomenon with 4 seasons.\n\nVisually, behind the reels is a stylish black and red background. There you will see the bank and many of the characters from the series. The reels are packed in the center of the screen. It's a bit cramped, even with the 3 reels, 1 payline set up.\n\nAbove the reels, you can see the show's videos. They don't do much. We would have preferred to see the paytable permanently positioned there rather than appear and disappear as is. \n\nFunctionality and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nTo get the free spins, La Casa de Papel online slot's main special feature, you need to land the three bank parts, i.e., Scatter symbols, on the payline. Even though this might be a bit difficult to do, you can get 3 free spins for doing it. During these free spins, you can collect high-yield banknotes ranging from 5 to 500 credits to start building your prize.\n\nYou can also choose to buy more time and potentially more free spins with the flip gamble game. If you land in the red zone, your bet is lost, and you return to regular reels. Landing in the green zone will guarantee you another 3 spins. You can redeem this bonus round for up to 11 times, giving you plenty of chances to pull off an epic win.\n\nLa Casa de Papel slot game is a great option for those who love 3-reel slots and this particular TV show. Even if you have never seen the show, the gambling and free spins make it a brilliant slot to try. There are some great chances to win, and the theme is very memorable.\n\nThe Heist Bonus feature is triggered by landing 3 building symbols on the payline on the same spin. You'll then play 3 free spins on a new set of reels. \n\nDuring the heist, the standard symbols are removed. In their place are the banknote symbols. These are available in denominations of 5x, 10x, 20x, 20x, 50x, 100x, 200x, and 500x.\n\nThese can land above, below, or on the payline. If a banknote lands on the payline, you'll win that amount as a prize. If more than one banknote lands on the payline, the amounts are added up. In theory, therefore, it's possible to land 1,500x your stake from a single spin.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nNetEnt's Scarface slot is based on the 1983 movie. It has 5 reels, 20 paylines, and the chance to win big thanks to wilds, free spins, and more. The nudge wild feature will help you collect a lot of extra wins, while the free spins are accompanied by a 3x bonus multiplier.\n\nAnother NetEnt slot you might want to check out is the Narcos game. This is another slot based on a Netflix TV show and offers 243 ways to win and much more. This game is rich in bonuses, including free spins and extra wilds that can walk on the reels.\n            ",
