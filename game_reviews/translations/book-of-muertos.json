Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGraphics and design that evoke the Day of the Dead\n\nBook of Muertos is a slot game that masterfully recreates the atmosphere of the Day of the Dead festival. Spinomenal's graphics are simple yet impactful, with the use of roses to characterize all the symbols and a background that displays a typical South American village at night with rose petals falling from above. The result is a colorful and celebratory game. \n\nA 6-reel grid with fixed paylines and a low game cost\n\nBook of Muertos features a 6-reel grid with 10 fixed paylines, making for a larger playing area than the standard 5x3 grid. Players can make a single bet of €0.10 per game. Additionally, the game includes an Autoplay feature, although unlike some other slots, players are not able to set a specific number of automatic spins in advance.\n\nMedium volatility and 96.01% theoretical return to player\n\nWith medium volatility and a theoretical return to player of 96.01%, Book of Muertos offers the chance for steady winnings without making players work too hard. The RTP value is fully within average for online slot games, while the medium volatility means that large prizes may not be as frequent.\n\nA Wild symbol that pays high and also functions as a Scatter\n\nOne of the standout symbols in Book of Muertos is the Wild symbol, represented by the book of the dead. This symbol not only substitutes for other symbols, but it also acts as a Scatter, providing ten Free Spins. If three Wild symbols are matched, a 2x multiplier is awarded, while six Wild symbols will award an impressive x500 payout. \n\nFree Spins with an expanded symbol feature\n\nDuring the Free Spins feature, a random symbol will be chosen, and each time it appears, it will expand to fill the entire reel. This can be a particularly lucrative feature for players who are lucky enough to receive a high-value symbol. It should be noted that this Bonus feature can also be purchased.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics\n\nBook of Muertos features a 6-reel grid with 3 rows and 10 fixed paylines. The game is playable for €0.10 per spin. It also has an Autoplay function, although the number of automatic spins cannot be predetermined.\n\nSymbols and Visuals\n\nThe game is themed around the Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico and features colorful symbols such as skulls, roses, and wreaths. Symbols with lower values are represented by playing cards (ten to ace), while those with higher values include a man with a gun, a woman with a mask, a skull, and a hat. The Book of the Dead symbol serves as both the Wild and Scatter, and it pays the most - up to x500 of the stake.\n\nVolatility and Return to Player\n\nBook of Muertos has a medium volatility, which means that it doesn't require too much effort to achieve winnings, but bigger payouts are rarer. The theoretical return to player is 96.01%, which is within the average range.\n\nWild and Scatter Features\n\nThe Book of the Dead symbol serves as both the Wild and Scatter. As a Wild, it substitutes for all the other symbols. As a Scatter, it gives ten Free Spins. During the Free Spins, one symbol is randomly chosen to be expanded across the entire reel each time it appears. Three, four, five, or six Book of the Dead symbols will trigger a 2x, 25x, 250x, or 500x multiplier, respectively.\n\nBonus Feature\n\nThe game's bonus feature consists of ten Free Spins, where one symbol is selected to expand on the entire reel each time it appears. Players can also buy this feature.\n\n        \n            ",

Rich in folklore, this celebration takes place between October 28th and November 1st and involves the use of allegorical floats, skulls, roses, and wreaths.\nWith this slot, Spinomenal has managed to recreate the right atmosphere that is breathed in the streets of Mexico City, thanks in part to a simple yet impactful graphics. In the background, you can see a typical South American village, but at night, with some lights and rose petals falling from above. And it is precisely the roses that characterize all the symbols, from low-level ones like playing cards to more remunerative ones like the skull and the masked woman.\nFixed paylines and a large grid\nUsually, we are used to seeing grids of 5×3, but in this case, Spinomenal has kept the 3 lines but opted for an additional reel, so 6. Paylines are 10 and fixed, with the cost of a single game set at €0.10.\nAmong the functions present, we find Autoplay, although unlike other games, here it is not possible to decide the number of automatic spins in advance.\nThe volatility is medium, while the theoretical return to player is 96.01%.\nA special feature that can also be purchased\nIn Book of Muertos, we find regular low and medium value symbols and a special one that instead gives very high winnings.\nThe symbols of lower value are the playing cards from ten to ace, while those of medium value are the hat, the crossed guns, the skull, and the woman.\nThe Wild symbol, represented by the book of the dead, pays more than all the others. With 3 of these symbols, we will have a 2x multiplier, with 4 symbols, it will be x25, with 5 symbols x250, and with 6, an impressive x500!\nOf course, the Wild symbol also covers the classic function of the Wild, replacing all the symbols. Moreover, it also has the function of Scatter and gives ten Free Spins, during which a random symbol will be chosen and each time it appears, it will expand to the entire reel. This Bonus can also be purchased.\n\nFAQs\nWhat is the RTP value in Book of Muertos?\nIn Book of Muertos, the theoretical return to player is 96.01%, a respectable return to player and fully within average.\n\nCan I play this slot on a tablet?\nOf course, there is a version for PC and one for mobile devices, to continue spinning the reels wherever you are and without losing fluidity.\n\nWhat is the volatility in Book of Muertos?\nThe volatility is medium, which means that you won't have to work too hard to get winnings, but particularly substantial prizes won't be so frequent.\n        ",
