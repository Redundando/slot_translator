We find ourselves atop towering mountain peaks shrouded by clouds and dotted with thorny bushes at their very brink. Our game board is set amidst this scenic backdrop, framed by a red border with golden accents. Funta Game has done an astounding job with the graphics, with symbols displaying in high resolution and brilliant colors that bring out every delicate detail. The use of large buttons also makes gameplay a breeze, contributing to the game's overall atmosphere, heightened by the accompanying oriental music that grows more intense as one engages the bonus round.\n\nFeatures of Four Wealth Creatures\nThe game board comprises 5 reels, though the number of rows changes randomly, typically from a base of 3-4-5-4-3. To win, one must land at least three identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel and progressing towards the right. The maximum payout is 2,000 times the bet.\n\nThe Autoplay function is present; one can activate 100 automatic spins by simply clicking the button, though you can specify the number of spins by clicking on the gear icon.\n\nThe volatility is high, offering substantial, albeit not too frequent, wins. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.1%.\n\nA Fiery Wild\nThis slot features four low-value symbols represented by playing cards, while the thematic symbols yield much more significant returns. These are the four elements portrayed as animals, with the turtle representing air, tiger earth, seadragon water, and the red dragon symbolizing fire.\n\nThe word Wild substitutes all symbols besides the red dragon, to which the Bonus game relates. The number of red dragons that land on the reels determines the layout that appears. Three dragons trigger a 5×3 grid, four dragons reveal a 3-4-3-4-3 pattern, while five dragons lead to a 3-4-5-4-3 layout. Three respins are awarded as the red dragons cross several reels, turning them wild.\n\nFAQ\nWhat's the theoretical return to player?\nIn Four Wealth Creatures, the RTP value is 96.1%.\n\nCan I try the slot before betting actual money?\nAbsolutely!

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nFeatures and gameplay of Four Wealth Creatures\nThe design and graphics of Four Wealth Creatures\nThe importance of the Wild symbol in Four Wealth Creatures\nVolatility and frequency of wins in Four Wealth Creatures\nThe Bonus game in Four Wealth Creatures\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Four Wealth Creatures\nA legendary landscape\nPlaying Four Wealth Creatures means taking a journey into Chinese tradition, not only through the slot's iconic references, but also and above all through the landscape that welcomes the game grid. We are in fact on the highest peaks of a mountain chain, surrounded by clouds and with a few bushes covering the summits. It is here that our game grid is placed, delimited by a red frame with golden inlays. We must say that Funta Game has done a sublime job from a graphic point of view, given the high resolution of the symbols and the bright colors that make every detail stand out. A well-chosen feature is also the use of large buttons, making the plays very easy. The soundtrack also contributes to creating a beautiful atmosphere, ranging from typical oriental sounds of the base game to a more intense theme when we play with the bonus.\nFeatures of Four Wealth Creatures\nThe game grid has 5 reels but the number of rows is variable, initially 3-4-5-4-3, but it can change randomly. To win, it is necessary to associate at least three identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards right. The maximum win is 2,000 times the bet.\nThere is the Autoplay function, by clicking the appropriate button, one hundred automatic spins will start, but if you want to activate fewer, you will have to press the gear icon and select the desired number.\nThe volatility is high, with substantial wins but not too frequent. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.1%.\nA fiery Wild\nIn this machine, we have four low-value symbols represented by playing cards, while the thematic symbols pay much more. They are the 4 elements represented by animals. So, we find the turtle associated with air, the tiger to earth, the sea dragon to water, and the red dragon to fire.\nThe Wild symbol replaces all symbols except the red dragon, to which the Bonus game is linked. Depending on the number of dragons that land on the reels, we will see the grid transform: with 3 dragons, we will get a 5x3 grid, with 4 dragons the pattern will be 3-4-3-4-3, and with 5 dragons, we will play with a 3-4-5-4-3 layout. We will be awarded three Respins, during which the red dragons will cross some reels, transforming them into Wilds.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\nIn Four Wealth Creatures, the RTP value is 96.1%.\n\nCan I try the slot before betting real money?\nCertainly, on our website, the Demo version is available precisely to familiarize and evaluate the game.\n\nWhat is the maximum win?\nYou can get a maximum win of 2,000 times the bet.\n            ",

The game grid has 5 reels, and the number of rows is variable initially set on 3-4-5-4-3, but it randomly changes. To win, players must match at least three symbols from left to right starting from the leftmost reel. The maximum win is 2,000 times the bet. There's an Autoplay function that allows you to play up to 100 automatic spins. The volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.1%.\n\nA fiery Wild\n\nFour Wealth Creatures slot game offers four low-value symbols represented by playing cards, while the thematic symbols pay much more. These symbols include the 4 elements represented by animals, such as a turtle associated with air; a tiger symbolizes Earth; a sea dragon represents water, and a red dragon represents fire. The Wild symbol, represented by a gold coin with a square hole in the middle and a red Chinese character on it, replaces all other symbols except the red dragon, which triggers the bonus game. Depending on the number of red dragon symbols on the reels, we will see the grid transform, and with three dragons, we get a 5x3 grid, with four dragons, the pattern is 3-4-3-4-3, and with five dragons, we'll play with a 3-4-5-4-3 layout. Players will be awarded three Respins, and the red dragons cross some reels, transforming them into Wilds.\n\nHigh volatility\n\nThe volatility in Four Wealth Creatures is high, offering substantial wins but not too frequent. The high volatility means that it has a high risk but makes it more exciting for players. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.1%, and players should keep this in mind when deciding how much to bet on each spin. The game can provide larger payouts if you're patient and allow a more extended session.\n\nGame graphics\n\nFour Wealth Creatures has sublime graphics, offering bright colors throughout the game. The symbols are high resolution, and the Chinese theme is evident in every detail. The game grid is placed on the highest peaks of a mountain range, surrounded by clouds and a few bushes covering the summits, giving it a legendary look. The game's soundtrack also adds to the Chinese atmosphere, starting with typical oriental sounds of a base game and turning more intense during the bonus round. The large buttons make the game easy to play and understand.\n\nGameplay and controls\n\nFour Wealth Creatures is very easy to play, with large buttons making it easy to understand. Players can choose the number of automatic spins with the Autoplay function up to one hundred, and they can also select the number of spins by pressing the gear icon. During the Respin round, players will have the chance to receive substantial payouts if they are lucky. The controls are user-friendly, and the bet amounts can be adjusted at any time by using the '+' and '-' buttons.\n\n        \n            ",

We are in fact on the highest peaks of a mountain chain, surrounded by clouds and with a few bushes covering the summits. It is here that our game grid is placed, delimited by a red frame with golden inlays. We must say that Funta Game has done a sublime job from a graphic point of view, given the high resolution of the symbols and the bright colors that make every detail stand out. A well-chosen feature is also the use of large buttons, making the plays very easy. The soundtrack also contributes to creating a beautiful atmosphere, ranging from typical oriental sounds of the base game to a more intense theme when we play with the bonus.\nFeatures of Four Wealth Creatures\nThe game grid has 5 reels but the number of rows is variable, initially 3-4-5-4-3, but it can change randomly. To win, it is necessary to associate at least three identical symbols starting from the leftmost reel and proceeding towards right. The maximum win is 2,000 times the bet.\nThere is the Autoplay function, by clicking the appropriate button, one hundred automatic spins will start, but if you want to activate fewer, you will have to press the gear icon and select the desired number.\nThe volatility is high, with substantial wins but not too frequent. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.1%.\nA fiery Wild\nIn this machine, we have four low-value symbols represented by playing cards, while the thematic symbols pay much more. They are the 4 elements represented by animals. So, we find the turtle associated with air, the tiger to earth, the sea dragon to water, and the red dragon to fire.\nThe Wild symbol replaces all symbols except the red dragon, to which the Bonus game is linked. Depending on the number of dragons that land on the reels, we will see the grid transform: with 3 dragons, we will get a 5x3 grid, with 4 dragons the pattern will be 3-4-3-4-3, and with 5 dragons, we will play with a 3-4-5-4-3 layout. We will be awarded three Respins, during which the red dragons will cross some reels, transforming them into Wilds.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the theoretical return to player?\nIn Four Wealth Creatures, the RTP value is 96.1%.\n\nCan I try the slot before betting real money?\nCertainly, on our website, the Demo version is available precisely to familiarize and evaluate the game.\n\nWhat is the maximum win?\nYou can get a maximum win of 2,000 times the bet.\n            ",
