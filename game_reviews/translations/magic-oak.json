    "original_text": "\nMagic Oak\nQuesta slot prodotta dalla Habanero ha come tema principale una foresta incantata dove vivono tanti simpatici animali: il saggio coniglio con gli occhiali da vista, il cinghiale dalla capigliatura alla moda, la volpe sorridente, l’orsetto vestito con gilet e camicia, lo scoiattolo dai grandi occhi azzurri e il gufo che tutto osserva. Lo grafica dei simboli è quella dei cartoni animati, con alcune animazioni che rendono i personaggi dotati di vita. La griglia di gioco ha una cornice di legno ed è immersa nel bosco, davanti alla grande quercia magica che dà il nome alla slot. Sulla destra c’è una pianta da cui fuoriesce una luce colorata, non solo un abbellimento grafico in quanto avrà una funzione durante il gioco. Sotto i rulli è indicato il valore della nostra scommessa, i tasti + e – per aumentarne il livello e quello per impostare la scommessa massima in un colpo solo. Ci sono poi i pulsanti per l’avvio del gioco e per far partire i giri automatici.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot\nPer questa slot gli sviluppatori di Habanero hanno pensato a una griglia con 4 rulli e 4 righe con 20 payline fisse, non modificabili. La scommessa minima è di 0,01 € per linea a cui andrà moltiplicato il livello di puntata (1, 2, 5, 7 e 10). La puntata totale minima (0,01 € per linea e livello scommessa 1) è di 0,20 €, la più alta è pari a 100 €. Si può decidere di impostare un numero di giri automatici che va da 10 sino a un massimo di 500. L’RTP è molto buono, pari al 96,71%.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Magic Oak\nIn questa slot si vince quando almeno 4 simboli (sino a un massimo di 16) si presentano in posizioni adiacenti. I simboli base sono rappresentati dai semi delle carte da gioco e hanno tutti lo stesso valore: con la scommessa minima  di 0,01 €, 4 simboli pagano 0,05 €, con 16 simboli si arriva a 4 €. Sempre tenendo conto della scommessa minima, la volpe e il coniglio pagano al massimo 12 €, l’orsetto lavatore 15 €, il cinghiale 25 €, la volpe 30 € e il gufo 50 €. Il simbolo Jolly è la tavoletta su cui è incisa la scritta Wild: oltre a pagare 250 € se appare 16 volte, ha la funzione di sostituire tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter, rappresentato dalla tavoletta con su scritto Scatter. Servono quattro Scatter per attivare i giri gratuiti: bisognerà cliccare su ogni simbolo Scatter dietro cui si cela il numero di giri gratuiti vinti,  che possono essere 2, 3 o 4. Durante i giri gratuiti lo Scatter non può comparire.\nCome dicevamo nel primo paragrafo, la pianta che si trova accanto alla griglia di gioco e da cui esce un bagliore, ha una funzione: da qui infatti usciranno casualmente dei bagliori gialli o azzurri, che rimarranno sospesi accanto alla griglia sino a quando non voleranno sui rulli. Il bagliore azzurro sostituirà tutti i simboli dello stesso tipo con il simbolo Wild, il bagliore giallo sostituisce un singolo simbolo sempre con il simbolo Wild.\n",

The wise rabbit sporting glasses, the trendy-haired boar, the smiling fox, the vest-clad bear, the blue-eyed squirrel, and the all-seeing owl are some of the cartoon-like symbols that come to life with exciting animations. The wooden-framed grid sits amidst the forest, facing the magical oak that lends its name to the slot. A plant to the right emits colored light that serves a purpose during gameplay, not just a visual embellishment. The bet value sits below the reels, with buttons for increasing the level and setting the maximum bet in one click, plus buttons for starting the game and initiating automatic spins.\n\nGame features\nHabanero devised a grid with four reels, four rows, and 20 fixed paylines that cannot be adjusted. The minimum bet per line is €0.01, multiplied by the betting level (1, 2, 5, 7, and 10). The minimum total bet (€0.01 per line and betting level 1) is €0.20 and the maximum is €100. You can set automatic spins ranging from 10 to 500. The game's RTP is high at 96.71%.\n\nMagic Oak Symbols and Features\nYou win by landing at least four symbols (up to a maximum of 16) in adjacent positions. The basic symbols are card suits and have the same value: with a minimum bet of €0.01, four symbols pay €0.05 and 16 symbols pay €4. The fox and rabbit pay a maximum of €12, the raccoon €15, the boar €25, the fox €30, and the owl €50, all with the same minimum bet. The Wild symbol is a tablet engraved with the word Wild, paying €250 when it appears 16 times and replacing all symbols except for the Scatter symbol, which is a tablet with the word Scatter. Four Scatters trigger free spins, and you must click on each Scatter symbol to reveal the number of free spins won, which could be 2, 3 or 4. During free spins, the Scatter will not appear.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the plant next to the grid emits a glow that serves a function. Here, yellow or blue glows randomly appear and remain suspended next to the grid until they fly onto the reels. The blue glow replaces all symbols of the same type with the Wild symbol, while the yellow glow replaces a single symbol with the Wild symbol.",

The graphics of the symbols are those of cartoons, with some animations that make the characters come to life. The game grid has a wooden frame and is immersed in the forest, in front of the great magical oak that gives its name to the slot. On the right there is a plant from which a colored light emerges, not just a graphic embellishment as it will have a function during the game. Below the reels, the value of our bet is indicated, with the + and - buttons to increase the level and the one to set the maximum bet in one go. There are also buttons to start the game and to start the automatic spins.\n\nMain Features of the Slot\n\nFor this slot, the developers of Habanero have thought of a grid with 4 reels and 4 rows with 20 fixed paylines, which cannot be modified. The minimum bet is €0.01 per line, to which the betting level (1, 2, 5, 7 and 10) will be multiplied. The minimum total bet (€0.01 per line and 1 bet level) is €0.20, the highest is €100. You can choose to set a number of automatic spins ranging from 10 up to a maximum of 500. The RTP is very good, at 96.71%.\n\nSymbols and Functions of Magic Oak\n\nIn this slot, you win when at least 4 symbols (up to a maximum of 16) appear in adjacent positions. The basic symbols are represented by the playing card suits and all have the same value: with a minimum bet of €0.01, 4 symbols pay out €0.05, and with 16 symbols you can get up to €4. Always keeping in mind the minimum bet, the fox and the rabbit pay out a maximum of €12, the raccoon €15, the boar €25, the fox €30 and the owl €50. The Wild symbol is the tablet on which the word Wild is engraved: in addition to paying out €250 if it appears 16 times, it has the function of substituting all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the tablet with the word Scatter. Four Scatters are needed to activate the free spins: you will have to click on each Scatter symbol behind which the number of free spins won is hidden, which can be 2, 3 or 4. During the free spins, the Scatter cannot appear.\n\nAs we mentioned in the first paragraph, the plant located next to the game grid and from which a glow emanates has a function: here, in fact, yellow or blue glows will randomly emerge, which will remain suspended next to the grid until they fly onto the reels. The blue glow replaces all symbols of the same type with the Wild symbol, while the yellow glow replaces a single symbol with the Wild symbol.\n            ",

Four Scatters are needed to activate the free spins: you will have to click on each Scatter symbol behind which the number of free spins won is hidden, which can be 2, 3 or 4. During the free spins, the Scatter cannot appear.\n\nAs we mentioned in the first paragraph, the plant located next to the game grid and from which a glow emanates has a function: here, in fact, yellow or blue glows will randomly emerge, which will remain suspended next to the grid until they fly onto the reels. The blue glow replaces all symbols of the same type with the Wild symbol, while the yellow glow replaces a single symbol with the Wild symbol.\n            ",

The Wild symbol substitutes all symbols except the Scatter and pays out €250 if it appears 16 times. The Scatter symbol is a tablet with the word 'Scatter' on it.

The graphics of the symbols are those of cartoons, with some animations that make the characters come to life. The game grid has a wooden frame and is immersed in the forest, in front of the great magical oak that gives its name to the slot. On the right there is a plant from which a colored light emerges, not just a graphic embellishment as it will have a function during the game. Below the reels, the value of our bet is indicated, with the + and - buttons to increase the level and the one to set the maximum bet in one go. There are also buttons to start the game and to start the automatic spins.\n\nMain Features of the Slot\n\nFor this slot, the developers of Habanero have thought of a grid with 4 reels and 4 rows with 20 fixed paylines, which cannot be modified. The minimum bet is €0.01 per line, to which the betting level (1, 2, 5, 7 and 10) will be multiplied. The minimum total bet (€0.01 per line and 1 bet level) is €0.20, the highest is €100. You can choose to set a number of automatic spins ranging from 10 up to a maximum of 500. The RTP is very good, at 96.71%.\n\nSymbols and Functions of Magic Oak\n\nIn this slot, you win when at least 4 symbols (up to a maximum of 16) appear in adjacent positions. The basic symbols are represented by the playing card suits and all have the same value: with a minimum bet of €0.01, 4 symbols pay out €0.05, and with 16 symbols you can get up to €4. Always keeping in mind the minimum bet, the fox and the rabbit pay out a maximum of €12, the raccoon €15, the boar €25, the fox €30 and the owl €50. The Wild symbol is the tablet on which the word Wild is engraved: in addition to paying out €250 if it appears 16 times, it has the function of substituting all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the tablet with the word Scatter. Four Scatters are needed to activate the free spins: you will have to click on each Scatter symbol behind which the number of free spins won is hidden, which can be 2, 3 or 4. During the free spins, the Scatter cannot appear.\n\nAs we mentioned in the first paragraph, the plant located next to the game grid and from which a glow emanates has a function: here, in fact, yellow or blue glows will randomly emerge, which will remain suspended next to the grid until they fly onto the reels. The blue glow replaces all symbols of the same type with the Wild symbol, while the yellow glow replaces a single symbol with the Wild symbol.\n            ",

The graphics of the symbols are those of cartoons, with some animations that make the characters come to life. The game grid has a wooden frame and is immersed in the forest, in front of the great magical oak that gives its name to the slot. On the right there is a plant from which a colored light emerges, not just a graphic embellishment as it will have a function during the game. Below the reels, the value of our bet is indicated, with the + and - buttons to increase the level and the one to set the maximum bet in one go. There are also buttons to start the game and to start the automatic spins.\n\nMain Features of the Slot\n\nFor this slot, the developers of Habanero have thought of a grid with 4 reels and 4 rows with 20 fixed paylines, which cannot be modified. The minimum bet is €0.01 per line, to which the betting level (1, 2, 5, 7 and 10) will be multiplied. The minimum total bet (€0.01 per line and 1 bet level) is €0.20, the highest is €100. You can choose to set a number of automatic spins ranging from 10 up to a maximum of 500. The RTP is very good, at 96.71%.\n\nSymbols and Functions of Magic Oak\n\nIn this slot, you win when at least 4 symbols (up to a maximum of 16) appear in adjacent positions. The basic symbols are represented by the playing card suits and all have the same value: with a minimum bet of €0.01, 4 symbols pay out €0.05, and with 16 symbols you can get up to €4. Always keeping in mind the minimum bet, the fox and the rabbit pay out a maximum of €12, the raccoon €15, the boar €25, the fox €30 and the owl €50. The Wild symbol is the tablet on which the word Wild is engraved: in addition to paying out €250 if it appears 16 times, it has the function of substituting all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the tablet with the word Scatter. Four Scatters are needed to activate the free spins: you will have to click on each Scatter symbol behind which the number of free spins won is hidden, which can be 2, 3 or 4. During the free spins, the Scatter cannot appear.\n\nAs we mentioned in the first paragraph, the plant located next to the game grid and from which a glow emanates has a function: here, in fact, yellow or blue glows will randomly emerge, which will remain suspended next to the grid until they fly onto the reels. The blue glow replaces all symbols of the same type with the Wild symbol, while the yellow glow replaces a single symbol with the Wild symbol.\n        ",
