While the theme is not original and the graphics are not particularly impressive, they are well done and feature evocative symbols such as Anubis, the half-man and half-dog god, and the golden book that serves as a Wild and Scatter symbol.

Players can place bets from 0.20 to 100 coins, and to win, they need to form combinations of two or three identical symbols on any pay line. The game is easy to understand and play, even for new players.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe symbols in Book of Gold: Symbol Choice include the traditional playing cards from 10 to Ace and four regular symbols with Ancient Egypt themes: the Ankh, the Eye, the Pharaoh, and Horus, with the Pharaoh representing the highest value icon. The Wild and Scatter symbols are a single icon that depicts the golden book which can serve as a wildcard to complete winning combinations and activate the Free Spins mode if it appears at least three times.\n\nBonuses and special features\n\nBook of Gold: Symbol Choice offers one bonus feature, which is the Free Spins mode activated by the Scatter symbol. Players get free spins and multipliers up to 200 times the bet, which increases their chances of winning big. Although the game does not have a wide range of special features, the Free Spins mode adds excitement to the gameplay and is a good opportunity to increase the winnings.\n\nRTP and volatility\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) in Book of Gold: Symbol Choice is 95.95%, which is average. The game has high volatility, so players can expect to have a tough time winning prizes.

The game screen features an evanescent blue temple with the deity Anubis, and the game grid is rather essential. Overall, the game design is simple and traditional, but it adequately conveys the game's theme and setting.\n\n        \n            ",

Indeed, one could say that games set on the banks of the Nile in recent years have become the equivalent of Fruit Machines of a few decades ago, popular and played at least once by all enthusiasts! \nHundreds of slot machines have been released featuring pharaohs and deities, and some have become real cults, such as the successful Book of Ra series. \nBook of Gold: Symbol Choice is therefore nothing new, and this also applies to the graphic compartment, which, albeit well done (like all games from Playson), does not amaze us with 3D animations or special effects. \nThe initial and game screens share the same background, a evanescent blue temple in which one can barely see its inhabiting deities, including Anubis, the half-man and half-dog god. \nThe game grid is rather essential, while at the bottom of the screen we find the buttons for settings and the one that allows access to the pay table.\nMain Features of the Slot Machine\nBook of Gold: Symbol Choice, besides not being a particularly original slot machine regarding the chosen theme, also turns out to be quite sparse in its game modes. Let's be clear, a simple and intuitive gameplay is not a negative thing in advance. However, we would have expected it to be articulated enough in this case to provide some particular reasons to choose Book of Gold: Symbol Choice. \nThe game grid is traditional, featuring five reels, three rows, and only ten pay lines, on which one can place bets from 0.20 to 100 coins. \nTo win, you need to form combinations of two or three identical symbols on any pay line. \nBook of Gold: Symbol Choice also does not surprise us with its theoretical return to player (RTP): its 95.95% is average, and with high volatility, it means that it could be tough to get prizes, but with a little patience, we could win some decent amounts. \nSymbols and features of Book of Gold: Symbol Choice\nThe symbols present on Book of Gold: Symbol Choice are the playing cards from 10 to Ace and four regular symbols with Ancient Egypt themes: the Ankh, the Eye, the Pharaoh, and Horus, with the Pharaoh representing the highest value icon. \nThe Wild and Scatter, on the other hand, are not two distinct symbols, but a single icon that depicts the golden book (Book of Gold) that gives its name to the slot: it can serve as a wildcard to complete winning combinations and, as a Scatter, if it appears at least three times, activates the Free Spins mode, which gives free spins and multipliers up to 200 times the bet.\n            ",

Indeed, one could say that games set on the banks of the Nile in recent years have become the equivalent of Fruit Machines of a few decades ago, popular and played at least once by all enthusiasts! \nHundreds of slot machines have been released featuring pharaohs and deities, and some have become real cults, such as the successful Book of Ra series. \nBook of Gold: Symbol Choice is therefore nothing new, and this also applies to the graphic compartment, which, albeit well done (like all games from Playson), does not amaze us with 3D animations or special effects. \nThe initial and game screens share the same background, a evanescent blue temple in which one can barely see its inhabiting deities, including Anubis, the half-man and half-dog god. \nThe game grid is rather essential, while at the bottom of the screen we find the buttons for settings and the one that allows access to the pay table.\nMain Features of the Slot Machine\nBook of Gold: Symbol Choice, besides not being a particularly original slot machine regarding the chosen theme, also turns out to be quite sparse in its game modes. Let's be clear, a simple and intuitive gameplay is not a negative thing in advance. However, we would have expected it to be articulated enough in this case to provide some particular reasons to choose Book of Gold: Symbol Choice. \nThe game grid is traditional, featuring five reels, three rows, and only ten pay lines, on which one can place bets from 0.20 to 100 coins. \nTo win, you need to form combinations of two or three identical symbols on any pay line. \nBook of Gold: Symbol Choice also does not surprise us with its theoretical return to player (RTP): its 95.95% is average, and with high volatility, it means that it could be tough to get prizes, but with a little patience, we could win some decent amounts. \nSymbols and features of Book of Gold: Symbol Choice\nThe symbols present on Book of Gold: Symbol Choice are the playing cards from 10 to Ace and four regular symbols with Ancient Egypt themes: the Ankh, the Eye, the Pharaoh, and Horus, with the Pharaoh representing the highest value icon. \nThe Wild and Scatter, on the other hand, are not two distinct symbols, but a single icon that depicts the golden book (Book of Gold) that gives its name to the slot: it can serve as a wildcard to complete winning combinations and, as a Scatter, if it appears at least three times, activates the Free Spins mode, which gives free spins and multipliers up to 200 times the bet.\n            ",
