Entrambi questi giochi sono della casa di sviluppo WMG e devono la loro fama a una combinazione di gioco intuitivo, grafica accattivante e distribuzione capillare in tutti i locali dotati di slot machine.\nUno di questi titoli è sicuramente Fowl Play Gold, la slot con la gallina d’oro a cui abbiamo dedicato una recensione, e l’altro è l’immancabile Haunted House slot. Questi due giochi hanno molte caratteristiche in comune, come avremo modo di sottolineare nei prossimi punti di questa recensione ed è un piacere per noi andare ad analizzare un pezzo di storia come quello rappresentato da questa slot.\nCominciamo quindi con l’aspetto più immediato.\n\nHaunted House slot machine: il comparto grafico e sonoro\nProprio come la gemella di fama di cui abbiamo parlato prima, anche Haunted House della WMG è dotata di una grafica semplice ma non banale, in grado di rimanere nell’immaginario dei giocatori che l’hanno provata per molti anni a venire.\nLa cornice che accompagna la griglia di gioco (non potendo essere presente il cabinato che abbiamo imparato ad amare) è il classico panorama di un film horror: sulla destra si trova un albero decrepito con i lunghi rami che ricordano delle dita scheletriche, sulla sinistra si trova invece la casa infestata che dà il nome alla slot stessa.\nI colori di questo scenario non sono propriamente di atmosfera, con tonalità molto accese riprese anche all’interno dei vari simboli, ma non importa: lo scopo di questi titoli era di portare colore e divertimento nella vita dei giocatori e non di tentare invano di spaventarli.\nI vari simboli che i nostalgici ancora amano si trovano al centro della schermata di gioco: si passa da elementi della casa infestata come i vampiri, il mostro di Frankenstein e la casa stessa per poi passare all’innocua frutta composta da limoni, arance, angurie e ciliegie.\nSolo al momento di una vincita l’atmosfera si farà leggermente più cupa, con il cielo dello sfondo che diventa notturno e tuoni che sferzano l’aria.\nEd è un suono che vorremo sentire spesso, dato che è associato alle vincite!\n\nHaunted House: meccaniche di gioco\nDa un punto di vista prettamente tecnico, la slot Haunted House slot, trovandosi alla base di molte altre slot della WMG, ne rispecchia i canoni che le hanno rese famose. Vediamoli insieme: un RTP pari al 90%, inferiore alla media di mercato ma che comunque permette di ottenere un buon numero di vincite durante il proprio gameplay.\nLa griglia è suddivisa in cinque rulli e tre linee orizzontali, dalla cui intersezione nascono i quindici simboli che vengono mostrata in ogni giocata. Le linee di vincita variano in base al valore della puntata, passando da un minimo di 5 a un massimo di 10, motivo per cui molti giocatori preferiscono giocare puntando il massimo possibile.\nNel gioco si trovano due simboli speciali, il primo è il simbolo Wild che può sostituire tutti gli altri nelle combinazioni. Il secondo è un simbolo Scatter, ovvero che dà accesso alla modalità bonus in qualsiasi posizione si trovi, purché se ne trovino almeno tre in un’unica giocata.\nIn questa modalità, ci troveremo a dare a scalare i vari piani della stessa casa infestata. Ogni piano è dotato di cinque porte che possiamo aprire e il nostro numero di vite varierà in base a quanti simboli scatter abbiamo ottenuto, da un minimo di 3 a un massimo di 5.\nQueste vite sono importanti per raggiungere il premio finale, poiché dietro ogni porta possiamo trovare diversi risultati che aiuteranno od ostacoleranno la nostra scalata. Il fantasma, ad esempio, ci priverà di una vita, mentre la mano ci spingerà verso il piano successivo (è inoltre possibile ottenere premi minori che si sommeranno in una vincita finale).\nRiassumendo il tutto: ci troviamo di fronte a una slot in cui la strategia di gioco del giocatore conta molto di più rispetto a tanti titoli moderni in cui siamo costretti a premere sempre lo stesso pulsante nel tentativo di ottenere una vincita.

Both of these games are developed by WMG and owe their fame to a combination of intuitive gameplay, eye-catching graphics, and widespread distribution in all locations with slot machines.\n\nOne of these titles is definitely Fowl Play Gold, the slot game with the golden chicken that we have previously reviewed, and the other is the inevitable Haunted House slot. These two games have many features in common, as we will highlight in this review. It is a pleasure for us to analyze a piece of history represented by this slot game.\n\nLet's start with the most immediate aspect.\n\nHaunted House slot machine: graphics and sound\n\nJust like its famous twin sister, Haunted House by WMG is equipped with a simple but not banal graphics, capable of remaining in the players' imagination for many years to come.\n\nThe frame that accompanies the game grid (as the slot machine cabinet that we have learned to love cannot be present) is the classic panorama of a horror movie: on the right is a decrepit tree with long branches resembling skeletal fingers, while on the left is the haunted house that gives the name to the slot itself.\n\nThe colors of this scenario are not particularly atmospheric, with very bright tones also found within the various symbols. But it doesn't matter: the purpose of these games was to bring color and fun into the players' lives, rather than trying in vain to scare them.\n\nThe various symbols that nostalgics still love are located in the center of the game screen: we go from haunted house elements such as vampires, Frankenstein's monster and the house itself, to innocent fruits made up of lemons, oranges, watermelons and cherries.\n\nOnly at the moment of a win does the atmosphere become slightly darker, with the backgroun sky turning night and thunder crackling in the air. And it's a sound we'll want to hear often, since it's associated with winning!\n\nHaunted House: gameplay mechanics\n\nFrom a purely technical point of view, the Haunted House slot game, being at the base of many other WMG slots, reflects the canons that made them famous.\n\nLet's look at them together: an RTP of 90%, lower than the market average but still allowing for a good number of wins during your gameplay.\n\nThe grid is divided into five reels and three horizontal lines, from the intersection of which the fifteen symbols that are displayed in each game are born. The paylines vary depending on the value of the bet, ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 10, which is why many players prefer to bet the maximum amount possible.\n\nIn the game, there are two special symbols: the first is the Wild symbol, which can substitute all others in the combinations. The second is a Scatter symbol, which gives access to the bonus mode in any position, as long as at least three are found in a single game.\n\nIn this mode, we will find ourselves climbing the various floors of the haunted house. Each floor has five doors that we can open and our number of lives will vary depending on how many scatter symbols we have obtained, from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 5.\n\nThese lives are important to reach the final prize, as behind each door we can find different results that will help or hinder our climb. The ghost, for example, will take away one life, while the hand will push us towards the next floor (it is also possible to obtain lesser prizes that will add up to a final win).\n\nIn summary, we are facing a slot game in which the player's gameplay strategy counts much more than in many modern titles where we are forced to press the same button repeatedly in an attempt to win. The choice regarding the number of paylines and above all which reels to hold or release becomes an essential component to personalize your gaming experience.\n\nSimilar Slots to Haunted House Slot\n\nIt is not easy to find slot machines that are similar to this WMG title. Speaking of gameplay mechanics, the most similar is obviously Fowl Play Gold. If instead, we want to explore the theme of horror in all its shades, we can suggest several titles: from Spooky Family by iSoftBet to Haunted Night by Genesis, to the eponymous Haunted House by Playtech, which uses a completely different mechanism similar to very old casino slots.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Haunted House Online a legal slot game?\n\nYes, it complies with all safety standards, but to be truly safe, you should only try it on licensed online casinos.\n\nCan you play Haunted House Slot Online for free?\n\nCertainly, both from our site and in the For Fun version on some online casinos.\n\nDoes Haunted House Online have a good RTP?\n\nNot really, since its RTP is 90%, which is much below the average (set at 96%).",

                            "content": "When it comes to popular slot games in Italy, there are two titles that come to mind for most people. Both of these games are developed by WMG and owe their fame to a combination of intuitive gameplay, eye-catching graphics, and widespread distribution in all places with slot machines.\nOne of these titles is undoubtedly Fowl Play Gold, the slot with the golden hen that we have already reviewed, and the other is the ubiquitous Haunted House slot. These two games share many features, as we will highlight in this review, and it is a pleasure for us to analyze a piece of history represented by this slot.\nLet's start with the most immediate aspect.\n\nHaunted House Slot Machine: Graphics and Sound\nJust like its popular sibling that we mentioned earlier, WMG's Haunted House also has simple but not banal graphics that remain in the imagination of players who have tried it for many years to come.\nThe frame that accompanies the game grid (since we can't have the cabinet that we've come to love) is the classic panorama of a horror film: on the right is a decrepit tree with long branches that resemble skeletal fingers, and on the left is the haunted house that gives its name to the slot.\nThe colors of this scenario are not particularly atmospheric, with very bright shades also found inside the various symbols, but it doesn't matter: the purpose of these titles was to bring color and fun into the lives of players and not to try vainly to scare them.\nThe various symbols that nostalgic players still love are in the center of the game screen: from haunted house elements like vampires, the Frankenstein monster, and the house itself to the harmless fruit made up of lemons, oranges, watermelons, and cherries.\nOnly at the moment of a win does the atmosphere become slightly darker, with the background sky turning into night and the sound of thunder crackling through the air.\nAnd it's a sound we want to hear often, as it's associated with wins!\n\nHaunted House: Gameplay Mechanics\nFrom a purely technical point of view, the Haunted House slot, being the foundation of many other WMG slots, reflects the canons that made them famous. Let's see them together: an RTP of 90%, lower than the market average but still allowing for a good number of wins during gameplay.\nThe grid is divided into five reels and three horizontal lines, from whose intersection the fifteen symbols that are shown in each play are born. The paylines vary depending on the value of the bet, ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 10, which is why many players prefer to bet the maximum amount possible.\nIn the game, there are two special symbols, the first being the Wild symbol, which can replace all others in combinations. The second is a Scatter symbol, which gives access to the bonus mode in any position, as long as at least three are found in a single play.\nIn this mode, we find ourselves scaling the various floors of the same haunted house. Each floor has five doors that we can open, and our number of lives will vary based on how many scatter symbols we have obtained, from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 5.\nThese lives are important for reaching the final prize, as behind each door we can find different results that will help or hinder our climb. The ghost, for example, will take away one of our lives, while the hand will push us toward the next floor (it's also possible to obtain smaller prizes that will add up to a final win).\nIn summary, we are facing a slot where the player's gameplay strategy counts much more than in many modern titles where we are forced to always press the same button in an attempt to obtain a win. The choice regarding the number of paylines and especially which reels to block or not becomes an essential component to personalize one's gameplay experience.\n\nSimilar Slots to Haunted House Slot\nIt's not easy to find slot machines that are similar to this WMG title. Regarding gameplay mechanics, the most similar one is undoubtedly Fowl Play Gold. If, instead, we want to explore the theme of horror in all its nuances, we can suggest several titles: from Spooky Family by iSoftBet to Haunted Night by Genesis, passing through the eponymous Haunted House by Playtech, which uses a completely different mechanism very similar to very old casino slots.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIs Haunted House Online a legal slot game?\n\nYes, it meets all safety standards, but to be truly safe, you should only try it at licensed online casinos.\n\nCan you play Haunted House Online for free?\n\nCertainly, both from our website and in the For Fun version on some online casinos.\n\nDoes Haunted House Online have a good RTP?\n\nNot really, since its RTP is 90% and is well below the average (set at 96%)."

And it's a sound we'll want to hear often, since it's associated with winning!\n\nHaunted House: gameplay mechanics\n\nFrom a purely technical point of view, the Haunted House slot game, being at the base of many other WMG slots, reflects the canons that made them famous.\n\nLet's look at them together: an RTP of 90%, lower than the market average but still allowing for a good number of wins during your gameplay.\n\nThe grid is divided into five reels and three horizontal lines, from the intersection of which the fifteen symbols that are displayed in each game are born. The paylines vary depending on the value of the bet, ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 10, which is why many players prefer to bet the maximum amount possible.\n\nIn the game, there are two special symbols: the first is the Wild symbol, which can substitute all others in the combinations. The second is a Scatter symbol, which gives access to the bonus mode in any position, as long as at least three are found in a single game.\n\nIn this mode, we will find ourselves climbing the various floors of the haunted house. Each floor has five doors that we can open and our number of lives will vary depending on how many scatter symbols we have obtained, from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 5.\n\nThese lives are important to reach the final prize, as behind each door we can find different results that will help or hinder our climb. The ghost, for example, will take away one life, while the hand will push us towards the next floor (it is also possible to obtain lesser prizes that will add up to a final win).\n\nIn summary, we are facing a slot game in which the player's gameplay strategy counts much more than in many modern titles where we are forced to press the same button repeatedly in an attempt to win. The choice regarding the number of paylines and above all which reels to hold or release becomes an essential component to personalize your gaming experience.\n\nSimilar Slots to Haunted House Slot\n\nIt is not easy to find slot machines that are similar to this WMG title. Speaking of gameplay mechanics, the most similar is obviously Fowl Play Gold. If instead, we want to explore the theme of horror in all its shades, we can suggest several titles: from Spooky Family by iSoftBet to Haunted Night by Genesis, to the eponymous Haunted House by Playtech, which uses a completely different mechanism similar to very old casino slots.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Haunted House Online a legal slot game?\n\nYes, it complies with all safety standards, but to be truly safe, you should only try it on licensed online casinos.\n\nCan you play Haunted House Slot Online for free?\n\nCertainly, both from our site and in the For Fun version on some online casinos.\n\nDoes Haunted House Online have a good RTP?\n\nNot really, since its RTP is 90%, which is much below the average (set at 96%).\n            ",

It has an RTP of 90% which is below the average, but it still allows for a good number of wins during gameplay. The grid is divided into five reels and three horizontal lines, there are 15 symbols that display in each game. The paylines range from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 10, depending on the value of the bet. The game has two special symbols: the Wild symbol, which can substitute all others in the combinations, and the Scatter symbol, which gives access to the bonus mode in any position, as long as at least three are found in a single game.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nThe graphics are simple but not banal and able to remain in the players' imagination for many years to come. The colors are not particularly atmospheric, with bright tones found within the various symbols. The purpose of the game is to bring color and fun into the players' lives and not to scare them. The sounds that accompanied the game enhance the player's experience and are also associated with winnings.\n\nRTP\n\nThe RTP of Haunted House is 90%, which is much lower than average (set at 96%).\n\nReel and Line Structure\n\nThe reel structure of Haunted House is divided into five reels and three horizontal lines, from the intersection of which the fifteen symbols that are displayed in each game are born. Paylines vary depending on the value of the bet, ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 10.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nIn the game, there are two special symbols: the Wild symbol, which can substitute all others in the combinations, and the Scatter symbol, which gives access to the bonus mode in any position, as long as at least three are found in a single game.\n\nBonus Mode\n\nIn the bonus mode, players will find themselves climbing the various floors of the haunted house. Each floor has five doors which players can open. The number of lives will vary depending on how many scatter symbols are obtained, from a minimum of three to a maximum of five. These lives are important to reach the final prize, as behind each door players can find different results that will help or hinder their climb. The ghost, for example, will take away one life, while the hand will push players towards the next floor. It is also possible to obtain lesser prizes that will add up to a final win.\n\nTheme\n\nHaunted House is a horror-themed video slot game filled with haunting symbols like vampires, Frankenstein's monster, and the haunted house itself. It is designed to bring fun and color to players' lives rather than to scare them.\n\nSimilar Slots\n\nSimilar to Haunted House in terms of gameplay mechanics is Fowl Play Gold. For horror-themed video slots, there is Spooky Family by iSoftBet, Haunted Night by Genesis, and Haunted House by Playtech, which uses a completely different mechanism similar to very old casino slots.\n\n        \n            ",

Both of these games are developed by WMG and owe their fame to a combination of intuitive gameplay, eye-catching graphics, and widespread distribution in all locations with slot machines.\n\nOne of these titles is definitely Fowl Play Gold, the slot game with the golden chicken that we have previously reviewed, and the other is the inevitable Haunted House slot. These two games have many features in common, as we will highlight in this review. It is a pleasure for us to analyze a piece of history represented by this slot game.\n\nLet's start with the most immediate aspect.\n\nHaunted House slot machine: graphics and sound\n\nJust like its famous twin sister, Haunted House by WMG is equipped with a simple but not banal graphics, capable of remaining in the players' imagination for many years to come.\n\nThe frame that accompanies the game grid (as the slot machine cabinet that we have learned to love cannot be present) is the classic panorama of a horror movie: on the right is a decrepit tree with long branches resembling skeletal fingers, while on the left is the haunted house that gives the name to the slot itself.\n\nThe colors of this scenario are not particularly atmospheric, with very bright tones also found within the various symbols. But it doesn't matter: the purpose of these games was to bring color and fun into the players' lives, rather than trying in vain to scare them.\n\nThe various symbols that nostalgics still love are located in the center of the game screen: we go from haunted house elements such as vampires, Frankenstein's monster and the house itself, to innocent fruits made up of lemons, oranges, watermelons and cherries.\n\nOnly at the moment of a win does the atmosphere become slightly darker, with the backgroun sky turning night and thunder crackling in the air. And it's a sound we'll want to hear often, since it's associated with winning!\n\nHaunted House: gameplay mechanics\n\nFrom a purely technical point of view, the Haunted House slot game, being at the base of many other WMG slots, reflects the canons that made them famous.\n\nLet's look at them together: an RTP of 90%, lower than the market average but still allowing for a good number of wins during your gameplay.\n\nThe grid is divided into five reels and three horizontal lines, from the intersection of which the fifteen symbols that are displayed in each game are born. The paylines vary depending on the value of the bet, ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 10, which is why many players prefer to bet the maximum amount possible.\n\nIn the game, there are two special symbols: the first is the Wild symbol, which can substitute all others in the combinations. The second is a Scatter symbol, which gives access to the bonus mode in any position, as long as at least three are found in a single game.\n\nIn this mode, we will find ourselves climbing the various floors of the haunted house. Each floor has five doors that we can open and our number of lives will vary depending on how many scatter symbols we have obtained, from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 5.\n\nThese lives are important to reach the final prize, as behind each door we can find different results that will help or hinder our climb. The ghost, for example, will take away one life, while the hand will push us towards the next floor (it is also possible to obtain lesser prizes that will add up to a final win).\n\nIn summary, we are facing a slot game in which the player's gameplay strategy counts much more than in many modern titles where we are forced to press the same button repeatedly in an attempt to win. The choice regarding the number of paylines and above all which reels to hold or release becomes an essential component to personalize your gaming experience.\n\nSimilar Slots to Haunted House Slot\n\nIt is not easy to find slot machines that are similar to this WMG title. Speaking of gameplay mechanics, the most similar is obviously Fowl Play Gold. If instead, we want to explore the theme of horror in all its shades, we can suggest several titles: from Spooky Family by iSoftBet to Haunted Night by Genesis, to the eponymous Haunted House by Playtech, which uses a completely different mechanism similar to very old casino slots.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Haunted House Online a legal slot game?\n\nYes, it complies with all safety standards, but to be truly safe, you should only try it on licensed online casinos.\n\nCan you play Haunted House Slot Online for free?\n\nCertainly, both from our site and in the For Fun version on some online casinos.\n\nDoes Haunted House Online have a good RTP?\n\nNot really, since its RTP is 90%, which is much below the average (set at 96%).\n            ",

But it doesn't matter: the purpose of these games was to bring color and fun into the players' lives, rather than trying in vain to scare them.\n\nThe various symbols that nostalgics still love are located in the center of the game screen: we go from haunted house elements such as vampires, Frankenstein's monster and the house itself, to innocent fruits made up of lemons, oranges, watermelons and cherries.\n\nOnly at the moment of a win does the atmosphere become slightly darker, with the backgroun sky turning night and thunder crackling in the air. And it's a sound we'll want to hear often, since it's associated with winning!\n\nHaunted House: gameplay mechanics\n\nFrom a purely technical point of view, the Haunted House slot game, being at the base of many other WMG slots, reflects the canons that made them famous.\n\nLet's look at them together: an RTP of 90%, lower than the market average but still allowing for a good number of wins during your gameplay.\n\nThe grid is divided into five reels and three horizontal lines, from the intersection of which the fifteen symbols that are displayed in each game are born. The paylines vary depending on the value of the bet, ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 10, which is why many players prefer to bet the maximum amount possible.\n\nIn the game, there are two special symbols: the first is the Wild symbol, which can substitute all others in the combinations. The second is a Scatter symbol, which gives access to the bonus mode in any position, as long as at least three are found in a single game.\n\nIn this mode, we will find ourselves climbing the various floors of the haunted house. Each floor has five doors that we can open and our number of lives will vary depending on how many scatter symbols we have obtained, from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 5.\n\nThese lives are important to reach the final prize, as behind each door we can find different results that will help or hinder our climb. The ghost, for example, will take away one life, while the hand will push us towards the next floor (it is also possible to obtain lesser prizes that will add up to a final win).\n\nIn summary, we are facing a slot game in which the player's gameplay strategy counts much more than in many modern titles where we are forced to press the same button repeatedly in an attempt to win. The choice regarding the number of paylines and above all which reels to hold or release becomes an essential component to personalize your gaming experience.\n\nSimilar Slots to Haunted House Slot\n\nIt is not easy to find slot machines that are similar to this WMG title. Speaking of gameplay mechanics, the most similar is obviously Fowl Play Gold. If instead, we want to explore the theme of horror in all its shades, we can suggest several titles: from Spooky Family by iSoftBet to Haunted Night by Genesis, to the eponymous Haunted House by Playtech, which uses a completely different mechanism similar to very old casino slots.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Haunted House Online a legal slot game?\n\nYes, it complies with all safety standards, but to be truly safe, you should only try it on licensed online casinos.\n\nCan you play Haunted House Slot Online for free?\n\nCertainly, both from our site and in the For Fun version on some online casinos.\n\nDoes Haunted House Online have a good RTP?\n\nNot really, since its RTP is 90%, which is much below the average (set at 96%).\n            ",

Both of these games are developed by WMG and owe their fame to a combination of intuitive gameplay, eye-catching graphics, and widespread distribution in all locations with slot machines.\n\nOne of these titles is definitely Fowl Play Gold, the slot game with the golden chicken that we have previously reviewed, and the other is the inevitable Haunted House slot.
