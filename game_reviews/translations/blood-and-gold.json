We are in a medieval kingdom where you must fight through 5 reels and take advantage of the 25 paylines. With an RTP of 96.03% and medium volatility, this game has excellent gameplay and the potential to win up to 2,300 times your total bet. But to achieve such a feat, you'll need to activate the additional bonuses that make the game more enticing. Discover more!\n\nGraphics of the Blood and Gold slot\nBlood and Gold presents two kingdoms ready to battle to win wars. The theme has been well-structured but, above all, developed with a graphic design that is truly captivating. The engaging soundtrack is also worth mentioning because it allows us to admire not only the reels but also the beauty of the environment that surrounds us in the game.\n\nThe basic symbols in Blood and Gold are the classic playing cards from 10 to Ace, together with a series of specific icons. We have a warrior queen, the king, the horn, and the catapult, but there are also Wild and Scatter symbols. The former replaces the game symbols except for the Shield, and the latter activates a special feature.\n\nGame features and functions\nThe Battle Round is the only real additional feature in terms of special functionality. It can be activated from the base game when 6-15 Scatter symbols are obtained. At that point, you choose your kingdom and start a real battle that you can fight with three lives. If you can win by matching your kingdom's flags, you can get some money. But be careful, if you lose a battle, you also lose a life, and if you run out of lives, you won't be able to continue fighting.\n\nFinal thoughts\nThe Blood and Gold slot is very interesting, engaging, and even downright unique if we want to find a way to define it. It is liked and surprises players with its graphics and prizes, but also with its basic features. In short, it doesn't have to envy many other latest-generation slots.\n\nFAQs\nWhat is the maximum win you can get with the Blood and Gold slot?\n\nThe potential win is 2,300 times the bet.\n\nDoes the online slot have bonus features?\n\nYes, but it lacks the free spins. Its Battle feature does not allow players to obtain the classic free spins, a choice that could also disappoint some players.\n\nCan I play the Blood and Gold slot for free?\n\nYes, just look for the demo version in online casinos, or directly on our portal.\n        ",
