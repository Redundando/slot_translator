The princess locked away in a castle tower, the knight in shining armor, the wise wizard, a cunning witch, and of course, the dragon guarding an ancient treasure. Bally's Jewel of the Dragon is a slot that takes the classic dragon-guarded treasure as its theme. Let's take a closer look in the review below.\n\nJewel of the Dragon - Graphics\nJewel of the Dragon's game grid is presented in a rather basic way, showing only the background with mountains of gold coins and not even a line to delineate the different reels. The slot's symbols are equally simple. We can find the usual card symbols (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, and 9) and bells that have become a classic of online slots, as well as more original symbols like the dollar sign on a golden coat of arms. Of course, the slot's name-giving symbols are also included: the Dragon, which we'll discuss later, and the jewels like the crown rich with precious stones. \n\nJewel of the Dragon suffers from rather sparse graphics, although it tries to compensate with bright colors that could attract potential players. In a sense, one could say that Jewel of the Dragon is not the best themed slot but neither is it the worst. But now let's focus on its gameplay!\n\nJewel of the Dragon - Gameplay\nAlthough at first glance the slot may seem similar to many others that can be found online, it's the small differences that make Jewel of the Dragon stand out. For starters, while most titles use a game grid of the 5x3 type with fifteen symbols shown at each spin, this slot uses a mechanism of the 5x4 type. This way, twenty symbols are shown at each spin, which combine along the paylines.\n\nWhat catches the attention the most is the bonus mode: the Dragon symbol, as one can expect from the slot's title, is our key to accessing the treasure. Finding at least three of them, we'll get free spins with fixed Wild symbols, which will significantly increase the value of our winnings during the various spins. Although free spins cannot be retriggered during the same mode, it's not uncommon to get quite sizable winnings, even up to 165 times our bet value.\n\nSlots similar to Jewel of the Dragon\nThe mythological figure of the dragon has inspired many slots.

The princess imprisoned in a castle tower, the knight without fear or reproach, the wise wizard, a clever witch, and of course, the dragon guarding an ancient treasure. Bally's Jewel of the Dragon slot game decides to offer the classic dragon-guarded treasure as its theme. Let's take a closer look at it in the review below.\n\nJewel of the Dragon – Graphics\nThe game grid of Jewel of the Dragon is quite basic, showing only the background with mountains of gold coins and not even a line to delimit the different reels. The symbols of the slot are equally simple, as we find card symbols (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and the numbers 10 and 9), bells that have become a classic of online slots, and more original symbols such as the dollar sign on a golden coat of arms. To these, of course, are added the symbols that give the slot its name: the dragon – which we will discuss later – and jewels such as the crown rich in precious stones.\n\nJewel of the Dragon suffers from rather minimalist graphics, although it tries to compensate with vibrant colors that can attract potential players. In a sense, we can say that Jewel of the Dragon is not the best themed slot, but neither is it the worst. But now let's focus on its gameplay!\n\nJewel of the Dragon – Gameplay\nEven though to a casual eye, the slot may appear similar to many others that can be found online, it is the small differences that make Jewel of the Dragon special. To begin with, while most titles use a 5*3 game grid with fifteen symbols displayed at each play, this slot uses a 5*4 mechanism. This way, twenty symbols are displayed at each play, which combine along the paylines.\n\nWhat strikes the most attention is the bonus mode: the Dragon symbol, as expected from the slot's title, is our key to accessing the treasure. Finding at least three of them, we will get free spins with fixed Wild symbols, which will greatly increase the value of our winnings during the various rounds. Although free spins cannot be retriggered during the same mode, it is not uncommon to get rather generous winnings, including those valued at up to 165 times our bet.\n\nSlot Games Similar to Jewel of the Dragon\nThe mythical figure of the dragon has inspired many slots. We can name some of them, such as Dragon’s Revenge, Dragon Island, Flaming Dragon, Gold Dragon Red Dragon, or those related to oriental mythology such as Dragon Dozer, 88 Dragon, and Sakura Dragon.\n            ",

The princess imprisoned in a castle tower, the knight without fear or reproach, the wise wizard, a clever witch, and of course, the dragon guarding an ancient treasure. Bally's Jewel of the Dragon slot game decides to offer the classic dragon-guarded treasure as its theme. Let's take a closer look at it in the review below.\n\nJewel of the Dragon – Graphics\nThe game grid of Jewel of the Dragon is quite basic, showing only the background with mountains of gold coins and not even a line to delimit the different reels. The symbols of the slot are equally simple, as we find card symbols (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and the numbers 10 and 9), bells that have become a classic of online slots, and more original symbols such as the dollar sign on a golden coat of arms. To these, of course, are added the symbols that give the slot its name: the dragon – which we will discuss later – and jewels such as the crown rich in precious stones.\n\nJewel of the Dragon suffers from rather minimalist graphics, although it tries to compensate with vibrant colors that can attract potential players. In a sense, we can say that Jewel of the Dragon is not the best themed slot, but neither is it the worst. But now let's focus on its gameplay!\n\nJewel of the Dragon – Gameplay\nEven though to a casual eye, the slot may appear similar to many others that can be found online, it is the small differences that make Jewel of the Dragon special. To begin with, while most titles use a 5*3 game grid with fifteen symbols displayed at each play, this slot uses a 5*4 mechanism. This way, twenty symbols are displayed at each play, which combine along the paylines.\n\nWhat strikes the most attention is the bonus mode: the Dragon symbol, as expected from the slot's title, is our key to accessing the treasure. Finding at least three of them, we will get free spins with fixed Wild symbols, which will greatly increase the value of our winnings during the various rounds. Although free spins cannot be retriggered during the same mode, it is not uncommon to get rather generous winnings, including those valued at up to 165 times our bet.\n\nSlot Games Similar to Jewel of the Dragon\nThe mythical figure of the dragon has inspired many slots. We can name some of them, such as Dragon’s Revenge, Dragon Island, Flaming Dragon, Gold Dragon Red Dragon, or those related to oriental mythology such as Dragon Dozer, 88 Dragon, and Sakura Dragon.\n            ",
