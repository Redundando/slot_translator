This game is perfect for those who love the classic slot machine experience. This page offers a brief review to give you an idea of what you can win.\n\nSimplicity at its Best\nDouble Diamond slot machine features only one payline and works with one coin per spin. It has three retro-style reels that spin, producing the unmistakable sound of traditional bar slot machines. The layout is dominated by the pink Double Diamond logo with two bright gems on either side.\n\nWhat are the Main Symbols?\nEven though it's a simple gameplay, this slot machine offers a couple of exciting elements:\n\nThe oval Double Diamond logo on the reels. This symbol doubles any winning combinations. As a Wild symbol, it replaces all other symbols to create new winning combinations. This logo can also help you win a super prize: if you align 3 Double Diamonds on a winning payline, you'll receive 1000 coins - not bad for a single coin spin!\nOther symbols on the reels include the vintage-style traditional icons, such as the numbers 7, cherries, and other distinctive symbols from old-fashioned mechanical slot machines.\n\nHow Do the Payouts Work?\nWhen the symbols align, you can win rich rewards. Keep in mind that a combination with a wild symbol in this game is doubled and that two wild symbols means you'll receive four times the payout. \n\nLower Payouts\nOne cherry in any position on the payline pays twice your bet.\nTwo cherries in any position on the payline pay x5.\nThree cherries in any position on the payline pay x3.\nThere's also a smaller payout for any three mixed bar symbols, which pays out 5x your bet.\n\nHigher Payouts\nThe biggest payouts are on the bar symbols:\n\nBar 1 pays 10x for three.\nBar 2 pays 25x for three.\nBar 3 pays 40x for three.\nThree red 7 symbols are worth 80x your bet.\n\nIs It Worth a Spin?\nDouble Diamond is a simple but enjoyable game for those who prefer three-reel online slots and don't want complicated storylines. You can try playing with real money and benefit from the welcome bonus or practice for free in demo mode on one of the casinos listed, for carefree entertainment!\n        ",
