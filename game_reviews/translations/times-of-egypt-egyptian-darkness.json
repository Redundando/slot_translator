This is a brand new online slot from Spinomenal that takes players on a journey to ancient Egypt and its mysterious riches. With Pharaohs, Pyramids, Sphinx and many other iconic figures, you can try your luck on a slot with 30 active paylines, a 5x3 structure, an RTP of 95.8% and a potential win of up to 1,000x. Let's take a closer look at the fascinating mysteries and gameplay that you will experience on the slot Times of Egypt - Egyptian Darkness!\n\nGraphics of the Times of Egypt - Egyptian Darkness slot\nAs previously mentioned, Times of Egypt takes us to Egypt, but with the aim of highlighting the darker side of this place. The game's developers have done an excellent job of not only making the animations enjoyable, but also the structure of the reels themselves. On Times of Egypt - Egyptian Darkness, we have various symbols, including playing cards with values ranging from 9 to Ace. But then we move on to the more lucrative symbols like the ring, scarab, hourglass, and Ankh. To try to win even more, the player must hope to achieve combinations with stacked symbols. In the next chapter, we will see what special icons are present and what kind of functions they can activate.\n\nGame features and functions\nWe are in Egypt, so what could be the Wild symbol of the slot? Obviously, Cleopatra is our Wild and her power is to replace all other symbols in the gameplay except the Scatter. However, there are no bonus modes in this case: the only special function that can be obtained is the free spins, which are activated by the pyramid symbol on the reels. With 3 or more Scatters, the player receives 20 free spins with medium 1x2 symbols, or 10 free spins with medium 1x3 symbols. It will be possible to try this function by purchasing the bonus at any time during the base game.\n\nFinal thoughts\nThe slot Times of Egypt - Egyptian Darkness is a good alternative game that owes its luck to the double free spin mode. This is why it is possible to activate it at any time during the game by purchasing it during any round.\n\nFAQs\nWhat is its RTP?\n\nIt has an RTP that is slightly below average and high volatility: this means that moderate and huge wins can be obtained, but also substantial losses if the budget is not managed properly.\n\nCan I play the Times of Egypt - Egyptian Darkness slot for free?\n\nOf course, it is possible to find the online slot for free not only at ADM casinos, but also on our platform.\n\nWhat is the strength of this online slot?\n\nIt has excellent graphics, but also surprises with its double free spin mode to choose from in case of purchasing the bonus.\n            ",
