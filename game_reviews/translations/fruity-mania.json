Il tutto con una slot a 5 rulli per 20 linee di pagamento.\nGrafica della slot\nLa slot, con RTP fissato al 95,86% è una golosa festa a base di frutta, vivace e con musica allegra pronta a condurti in questo sentiero tortuoso alla ricerca di qualche vincita interessante. Non parliamo però di una macchinetta moderna, quindi non ti aspettare grafiche spettacolari e animazioni da urlo. Tutto ciò che potrai ammirare in questo caso è una variegata quantità di frutti, un cocktail fruttato che è il nostro Wild e solo le classiche impostazioni per poter scommettere. I frutti sono ben curati, ma non vi sono altri dettagli grafici degni di nota.\nCaratteristiche e funzionalità speciali\nIl giocatore deve trovare simboli identici da sinistra a destra e riuscire così a sbloccare le vincite che sono attribuite a ogni frutto. Le icone con il valore più basso cono le banane, i limoni, le ciliegie e le prugne che ripagano con 100 se ne trovi cinque di fila. Saliamo poi con le mele a quota 400 e si finisce con le ciliegie che ti possono offrire una vincita fino a 400 volte la puntata iniziale. Sicuramente questa semplicità e la velocità con cui si entra nel gioco è una caratteristica interessante, che però potrebbe attirare solo i giocatori più esperti.\nL’unico colpo di scena è il Wild che può sostituire qualsiasi simbolo del gioco base per aiutarti a creare delle combinazioni.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Fruity Mania\nCome avrai capito non ci sono grossi colpi di scena su Fruity Mania ma proprio per questo potrebbe piacere tanto. Sarà apprezzata dai veterani che hanno sempre giocato con le slot nei casinò terrestri, preferendo la semplicità alla tecnologia.

We are not talking, however, about a modern machine, so do not expect spectacular graphics and mind-blowing animations.

Then we rise with the apples to a quota of 400 and end with the cherries that can offer you a win up to 400 times the initial bet. Surely this simplicity and the speed with which you enter the game is an interesting feature, but it could only attract more experienced players.\nThe only surprise is the Wild that can replace any symbol of the base game to help you create combinations.\nFinal thoughts on Fruity Mania slot\nAs you may have understood, there are no big surprises on Fruity Mania, but precisely for this reason, it could be so appealing. It will be appreciated by veterans who have always played with slots in land-based casinos, preferring simplicity to technology. Too bad, however, for the absence of free spins, because they would have been an interesting plus to try out!\nIf you love simple and straightforward games, start having fun with this slot right away!\n            ",

The slot industry could never do without it, and Felix Gaming knows it well, which is why it has decided to focus on the online slot machine Fruity Mania. The decision was to strip the slot of eccentric and special features, leaving space for a fun worthy of past years. All with a 5-reel slot machine for 20 paylines.\nGraphics of the slot\nThe slot, with an RTP set at 95.86%, is a delicious fruit-based party, lively and with cheerful music that is ready to lead you down this winding path in search of some interesting winnings. We are not talking, however, about a modern machine, so do not expect spectacular graphics and mind-blowing animations. All you can admire in this case is a varied quantity of fruits, a fruity cocktail that is our Wild and only the classic settings to be able to bet. The fruits are well cared for, but there are no other noteworthy graphic details.\nFeatures and special functions\nThe player must find identical symbols from left to right and thus be able to unlock the winnings that are attributed to each fruit. The icons with the lowest value are bananas, lemons, cherries, and plums that pay off with 100 if you find five in a row. Then we rise with the apples to a quota of 400 and end with the cherries that can offer you a win up to 400 times the initial bet. Surely this simplicity and the speed with which you enter the game is an interesting feature, but it could only attract more experienced players.\nThe only surprise is the Wild that can replace any symbol of the base game to help you create combinations.\nFinal thoughts on Fruity Mania slot\nAs you may have understood, there are no big surprises on Fruity Mania, but precisely for this reason, it could be so appealing. It will be appreciated by veterans who have always played with slots in land-based casinos, preferring simplicity to technology. Too bad, however, for the absence of free spins, because they would have been an interesting plus to try out!\nIf you love simple and straightforward games, start having fun with this slot right away!\n            ",
