Many knights and aspiring ones in these stories fight with dragons to earn the coveted treasure.

A trademark of Merkur is simplicity, a characteristic that mainly denotes the grid itself with its light yellowish color and small decorations. After all, it's not the grid that's so important in a slot, but its symbols!\n\nThe symbols of Dragon's Treasure are divided between those of playing cards (A, K, Q, J), which are represented with letters reminiscent of those of ancient medieval texts, and more particular symbols represented by characters and objects. We will see, in fact, two symbols represented by two knights (one blond and the other chestnut), the golden hilt of a sword and the chest containing the dragon's treasure.\n\nLike many other Merkur slots, Dragon's Treasure also uses 3D models.

Many knights and aspiring ones in these stories fight with dragons to earn the coveted treasure. Merkur's Dragon's Treasure will turn us into adventurers in search of fortune and riches, battling a dragon who guards its treasure. But let's start by discussing this slot, starting with an aspect often overlooked in reviews but actually interesting to analyze: the graphics.\n\nDragon's Treasure - Graphics\n\nIn a rather desolate forest and under an unsettling sulfur-colored sky, we find the game grid of Dragon's Treasure. A trademark of Merkur is simplicity, a characteristic that mainly denotes the grid itself with its light yellowish color and small decorations. After all, it's not the grid that's so important in a slot, but its symbols!\n\nThe symbols of Dragon's Treasure are divided between those of playing cards (A, K, Q, J), which are represented with letters reminiscent of those of ancient medieval texts, and more particular symbols represented by characters and objects. We will see, in fact, two symbols represented by two knights (one blond and the other chestnut), the golden hilt of a sword and the chest containing the dragon's treasure.\n\nLike many other Merkur slots, Dragon's Treasure also uses 3D models. Unfortunately, it is also true that the graphics used by the development house appear rather dated compared to the 3D models we are used to today. But now let's focus on the technical part of this slot.\n\nDragon's treasure - In addition to illustrations\n\nLet's move on to the technical aspect now: we are facing a slot with an RTP of 96%, a relatively high value compared to the average. The mechanism used is 5 * 3, with fifteen symbols shown at each play. It is surprising to see the extremely reduced number of winning lines, only five, but the game can be generous even in this case. \n\nThe symbol we need to pay the most attention to is certainly the dragon, which plays the role of Wild symbol capable of replacing the other symbols in the game, as well as Scatter symbol that allows us to access free spins. At the beginning of this special mode, we have to choose a symbol, which will be endowed with the \"expansion\" function during all the free spins. After each spin, the chosen symbol will expand over the entire reel, and we will obtain winnings in relation to how many symbols we have obtained of that type. \n\nThe player must then decide, based on their own strategy, whether to aim for more common but less rich symbols or whether to target rarer and more valuable ones.\n\nSlots Similar to Dragon's Treasure\n\nFierce dragons and treasures are still a rather niche setting in the world of slots. Among the most interesting examples, we find: Dragon's Cave, Vikings Gods Gold, Flaming Dragon, and The Wiz.\n            ",

Many knights and aspiring ones in these stories fight with dragons to earn the coveted treasure. Merkur's Dragon's Treasure will turn us into adventurers in search of fortune and riches, battling a dragon who guards its treasure. But let's start by discussing this slot, starting with an aspect often overlooked in reviews but actually interesting to analyze: the graphics.\n\nDragon's Treasure - Graphics\n\nIn a rather desolate forest and under an unsettling sulfur-colored sky, we find the game grid of Dragon's Treasure. A trademark of Merkur is simplicity, a characteristic that mainly denotes the grid itself with its light yellowish color and small decorations. After all, it's not the grid that's so important in a slot, but its symbols!\n\nThe symbols of Dragon's Treasure are divided between those of playing cards (A, K, Q, J), which are represented with letters reminiscent of those of ancient medieval texts, and more particular symbols represented by characters and objects. We will see, in fact, two symbols represented by two knights (one blond and the other chestnut), the golden hilt of a sword and the chest containing the dragon's treasure.\n\nLike many other Merkur slots, Dragon's Treasure also uses 3D models. Unfortunately, it is also true that the graphics used by the development house appear rather dated compared to the 3D models we are used to today. But now let's focus on the technical part of this slot.\n\nDragon's treasure - In addition to illustrations\n\nLet's move on to the technical aspect now: we are facing a slot with an RTP of 96%, a relatively high value compared to the average. The mechanism used is 5 * 3, with fifteen symbols shown at each play. It is surprising to see the extremely reduced number of winning lines, only five, but the game can be generous even in this case. \n\nThe symbol we need to pay the most attention to is certainly the dragon, which plays the role of Wild symbol capable of replacing the other symbols in the game, as well as Scatter symbol that allows us to access free spins. At the beginning of this special mode, we have to choose a symbol, which will be endowed with the \"expansion\" function during all the free spins. After each spin, the chosen symbol will expand over the entire reel, and we will obtain winnings in relation to how many symbols we have obtained of that type. \n\nThe player must then decide, based on their own strategy, whether to aim for more common but less rich symbols or whether to target rarer and more valuable ones.\n\nSlots Similar to Dragon's Treasure\n\nFierce dragons and treasures are still a rather niche setting in the world of slots. Among the most interesting examples, we find: Dragon's Cave, Vikings Gods Gold, Flaming Dragon, and The Wiz.\n            ",
