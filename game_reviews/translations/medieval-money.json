            "response": "Medieval Money is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot game by IGT that can be played on all devices, boasting 5 bonus features in total. The key to unlocking them is the Archery Picker - you can win cash prizes of up to 200 times your bet in 3 of them. The best one is the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature, where you get 7 free spins and blue/red knights battle each other to turn the blue or red symbols on the reels into wilds. \n\nA medieval theme powers Medieval Money, which has 5 reels and 20 paylines. The game is only available on desktop devices (PC or laptop) and can be played from a minimum bet of €0.20 up to €600 per spin. With a clear medieval theme, you don your best shining armor to seek wealth and fun throughout the kingdom. \n\nAesthetically speaking, it features cartoonish graphics with jester hats, targets, kings, queens, princesses, and knights on the reels. The highest-paying symbol is the Medieval Money logo that rewards you with 1,000 times your bet if you manage to get 5 on a payline. \n\nThe king's court is opening up, which means it's time for worthy people to don their best armor and travel through this enchanting kingdom with Medieval Money. Start the bonus game and aim your bow for one of the four bonus missions. \n\nBring in the money with the Money Bags Picker feature, joust with the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature, pick your fortune with Spell Picker, or face the dragon for its treasure in the Dragon Path Bonus feature. Manage all four and you will undoubtedly be the richest person in the land. As you can tell, this game is all about the bonus features, as IGT traditionally does a good job of packaging them. \n\nLoaded with goodies and a cliché theme, Medieval Money is trying to make its mark among IGT games. Such ideals are certainly lofty, so the big question is: can this new game live up to such ambition? There's only one way to find out, so we suggest you keep reading! \n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols \n\nThe Bonus symbol is the target, and 3 of them on any of the 3 central reels trigger the Archery Picker feature - here, you select 1 of 9 targets to reveal a bonus feature: \n\nMoney Bags Picker feature: you can choose 1 of 3 money bags to reveal a cash prize ranging from 2 to 50 times your total bet. \n\nJoust Free Spins Bonus feature - you will receive 7 free spins with the Jousting Wilds Expansion feature. This is played when the red and blue Knight Helmet wild symbols appear on the same row - they will joust to randomly determine the winner. If the blue knight is victorious, all blue symbols on the row between the helmet symbols turn into wilds. If the red knight wins, all red symbols turn into wilds. What's hoped for is that the 2 wilds appear on reels 1 and 5! \n\nThe Spell Picker feature sees a wizard offering 5 mysterious spell bottles - these are worth from 2 to 100 times your total stake. You can choose to accept the offer presented by the wizard or to reject it - up to 5 offers will be made, so make sure to choose wisely. Anything over 25 times your bet is, in my opinion, decent. \n\nFinally, you have the Dragon Path Bonus feature where you spin the wheel - the number of spaces (1, 2 or 3) that the wheel indicates will move you along the path. If the wheel lands on a skull, the feature ends. The farther you progress, the higher the prize on offer - the stake is between 3 and 200 times the total amount to be won. The bet will be 200 times greater if you reach or surpass the Dragon's treasure. \n\nAll in all, Medieval Money is a fun slot game with great winning potential - the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature is the most lucrative as getting a row of free spins can lead to huge wins. \n\nWhile Medieval Money may not have the best graphics that IGT has ever put in a game, it is still one of the best games in terms of overall feel and rewards offered. What this game actually shows is that graphics are not everything and the end-all-be-all of slot games, as it's a game that really grows on you over time, despite its visual doubts. The more you play, the more you will like it. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAs far as theme goes, I recommend trying NextGen Gaming's Robin Hood Prince of Tweets. Available on all devices, it is inspired by the story of Robin Hood with a bird twist (yes, strange). Using the SuperBet feature, there is the Robin Hood Arrow feature where the wild can turn adjacent symbols into wilds.",

Loaded with gems and a somewhat cliché theme, Medieval Money tries to leave a mark as one of IGT's games. Its lofty ambitions are certainly boisterous, but the big question now is, can this new game live up to such ambition?\n\nThe bonus symbol is the target that triggers the Archer Picker when three land on any point of the three central reels. You select a target to reveal a bonus feature. These features include the Money Bags Picker where you choose one of three money bags revealing a cash prize ranging from 2 to 50 times your total bet. There's also the Joust Free Spins Bonus, where you get seven free spins with the Jousting Wilds Expansion feature. In addition, there's the Spell Picker feature where a wizard offers five bottles of mysterious spells worth 2 to 100 times your total bet.\n\nLastly, there's the Dragon Path Bonus where you spin the wheel. The number of spaces indicated on the wheel (1, 2, or 3) moves you along the path. If the wheel lands on a skull, the feature ends. The higher you progress, the bigger the reward on offer is. The bet is between 3 and 200 times the total bet to win. The bet is 200 times larger if you reach or exceed the Dragon's treasure.\n\nAll in all, Medieval Money is a fun slot game with the potential for big wins, with the Joust Free Spins Bonus being the most profitable. Although not having the best graphics among IGT's games, Medieval Money is one of the best games in terms of the overall gaming experience and rewards on offer. This game shows that graphics aren't everything as it is a game that really grows on you over time, despite its visual flaws. The more you play, the more you'll enjoy it.\n\nIf you're looking for a similar themed game, we recommend trying Robin Hood Prince of Tweets by NextGen Gaming, which is available on all devices. It draws inspiration from Robin Hood's story with a touch of birds. With the SuperBet feature, there's the Robin Hood's Arrow Bonus where the wilds can transform adjacent symbols into wilds."

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nMedieval theme\n5 bonus features\nArchery Picker\nJoust Free Spins Bonus feature\nSymbol transformation\nOther bonus features\nWinning potential\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Medieval Money is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot game by IGT that can be played on all devices, boasting 5 bonus features in total. The key to unlocking them is the Archery Picker - you can win cash prizes of up to 200 times your bet in 3 of them. The best one is the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature, where you get 7 free spins and blue/red knights battle each other to turn the blue or red symbols on the reels into wilds. \n\nA medieval theme powers Medieval Money, which has 5 reels and 20 paylines. The game is only available on desktop devices (PC or laptop) and can be played from a minimum bet of €0.20 up to €600 per spin. With a clear medieval theme, you don your best shining armor to seek wealth and fun throughout the kingdom. \n\nAesthetically speaking, it features cartoonish graphics with jester hats, targets, kings, queens, princesses, and knights on the reels. The highest-paying symbol is the Medieval Money logo that rewards you with 1,000 times your bet if you manage to get 5 on a payline. \n\nThe king's court is opening up, which means it's time for worthy people to don their best armor and travel through this enchanting kingdom with Medieval Money. Start the bonus game and aim your bow for one of the four bonus missions. \n\nBring in the money with the Money Bags Picker feature, joust with the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature, pick your fortune with Spell Picker, or face the dragon for its treasure in the Dragon Path Bonus feature. Manage all four and you will undoubtedly be the richest person in the land. As you can tell, this game is all about the bonus features, as IGT traditionally does a good job of packaging them. \n\nLoaded with goodies and a cliché theme, Medieval Money is trying to make its mark among IGT games. Such ideals are certainly lofty, so the big question is: can this new game live up to such ambition? There's only one way to find out, so we suggest you keep reading! \n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols \n\nThe Bonus symbol is the target, and 3 of them on any of the 3 central reels trigger the Archery Picker feature - here, you select 1 of 9 targets to reveal a bonus feature: \n\nMoney Bags Picker feature: you can choose 1 of 3 money bags to reveal a cash prize ranging from 2 to 50 times your total bet. \n\nJoust Free Spins Bonus feature - you will receive 7 free spins with the Jousting Wilds Expansion feature. This is played when the red and blue Knight Helmet wild symbols appear on the same row - they will joust to randomly determine the winner. If the blue knight is victorious, all blue symbols on the row between the helmet symbols turn into wilds. If the red knight wins, all red symbols turn into wilds. What's hoped for is that the 2 wilds appear on reels 1 and 5! \n\nThe Spell Picker feature sees a wizard offering 5 mysterious spell bottles - these are worth from 2 to 100 times your total stake. You can choose to accept the offer presented by the wizard or to reject it - up to 5 offers will be made, so make sure to choose wisely. Anything over 25 times your bet is, in my opinion, decent. \n\nFinally, you have the Dragon Path Bonus feature where you spin the wheel - the number of spaces (1, 2 or 3) that the wheel indicates will move you along the path. If the wheel lands on a skull, the feature ends. The farther you progress, the higher the prize on offer - the stake is between 3 and 200 times the total amount to be won. The bet will be 200 times greater if you reach or surpass the Dragon's treasure. \n\nAll in all, Medieval Money is a fun slot game with great winning potential - the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature is the most lucrative as getting a row of free spins can lead to huge wins. \n\nWhile Medieval Money may not have the best graphics that IGT has ever put in a game, it is still one of the best games in terms of overall feel and rewards offered. What this game actually shows is that graphics are not everything and the end-all-be-all of slot games, as it's a game that really grows on you over time, despite its visual doubts. The more you play, the more you will like it. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAs far as theme goes, I recommend trying NextGen Gaming's Robin Hood Prince of Tweets. Available on all devices, it is inspired by the story of Robin Hood with a bird twist (yes, strange). Using the SuperBet feature, there is the Robin Hood Arrow feature where the wild can turn adjacent symbols into wilds.\n            ",

The game is set in a kingdom where players don their best shining armor to seek wealth and fun. Symbols on the reels include jester hats, targets, kings, queens, princesses, and knights. The highest-paying symbol is the Medieval Money logo that pays out 1,000 times your bet if you get 5 on a payline.\n\n5 bonus features\n\nMedieval Money has 5 bonus features, which is the key to unlocking the biggest wins in the game. The Archery Picker feature is the one that triggers the bonus features. Players select 1 of 9 targets to reveal a bonus feature. The available features are the Money Bags Picker, Joust Free Spins Bonus, Spell Picker, and Dragon Path Bonus. Each feature offers a unique opportunity to win big and can be triggered multiple times during gameplay.\n\nArchery Picker\n\nThe Archery Picker feature in Medieval Money is the key to unlocking the bonus features of the game. When players land 3 Bonus symbols on any of the 3 central reels, they trigger the Archery Picker feature. Players select 1 of 9 targets to reveal a bonus feature.

This feature can result in significant payouts.\n\nOther bonus features\n\nMedieval Money has three additional bonus features, which are triggered through the Archery Picker feature in the base game. The Money Bags Picker feature offers cash prizes ranging from 2 to 50 times the total bet, Spell Picker feature that offers 5 mysterious spell bottles worth from 2 to 100 times the total stake, and the Dragon Path Bonus feature that gives players the chance to win up to 200 times their total amount.\n\nWinning potential\n\nMedieval Money has excellent winning potential, thanks to its various bonus features.

The key to unlocking them is the Archery Picker - you can win cash prizes of up to 200 times your bet in 3 of them. The best one is the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature, where you get 7 free spins and blue/red knights battle each other to turn the blue or red symbols on the reels into wilds. \n\nA medieval theme powers Medieval Money, which has 5 reels and 20 paylines. The game is only available on desktop devices (PC or laptop) and can be played from a minimum bet of €0.20 up to €600 per spin. With a clear medieval theme, you don your best shining armor to seek wealth and fun throughout the kingdom. \n\nAesthetically speaking, it features cartoonish graphics with jester hats, targets, kings, queens, princesses, and knights on the reels. The highest-paying symbol is the Medieval Money logo that rewards you with 1,000 times your bet if you manage to get 5 on a payline. \n\nThe king's court is opening up, which means it's time for worthy people to don their best armor and travel through this enchanting kingdom with Medieval Money. Start the bonus game and aim your bow for one of the four bonus missions. \n\nBring in the money with the Money Bags Picker feature, joust with the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature, pick your fortune with Spell Picker, or face the dragon for its treasure in the Dragon Path Bonus feature. Manage all four and you will undoubtedly be the richest person in the land. As you can tell, this game is all about the bonus features, as IGT traditionally does a good job of packaging them. \n\nLoaded with goodies and a cliché theme, Medieval Money is trying to make its mark among IGT games. Such ideals are certainly lofty, so the big question is: can this new game live up to such ambition? There's only one way to find out, so we suggest you keep reading! \n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols \n\nThe Bonus symbol is the target, and 3 of them on any of the 3 central reels trigger the Archery Picker feature - here, you select 1 of 9 targets to reveal a bonus feature: \n\nMoney Bags Picker feature: you can choose 1 of 3 money bags to reveal a cash prize ranging from 2 to 50 times your total bet. \n\nJoust Free Spins Bonus feature - you will receive 7 free spins with the Jousting Wilds Expansion feature. This is played when the red and blue Knight Helmet wild symbols appear on the same row - they will joust to randomly determine the winner. If the blue knight is victorious, all blue symbols on the row between the helmet symbols turn into wilds. If the red knight wins, all red symbols turn into wilds. What's hoped for is that the 2 wilds appear on reels 1 and 5! \n\nThe Spell Picker feature sees a wizard offering 5 mysterious spell bottles - these are worth from 2 to 100 times your total stake. You can choose to accept the offer presented by the wizard or to reject it - up to 5 offers will be made, so make sure to choose wisely. Anything over 25 times your bet is, in my opinion, decent. \n\nFinally, you have the Dragon Path Bonus feature where you spin the wheel - the number of spaces (1, 2 or 3) that the wheel indicates will move you along the path. If the wheel lands on a skull, the feature ends. The farther you progress, the higher the prize on offer - the stake is between 3 and 200 times the total amount to be won. The bet will be 200 times greater if you reach or surpass the Dragon's treasure. \n\nAll in all, Medieval Money is a fun slot game with great winning potential - the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature is the most lucrative as getting a row of free spins can lead to huge wins. \n\nWhile Medieval Money may not have the best graphics that IGT has ever put in a game, it is still one of the best games in terms of overall feel and rewards offered. What this game actually shows is that graphics are not everything and the end-all-be-all of slot games, as it's a game that really grows on you over time, despite its visual doubts. The more you play, the more you will like it. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAs far as theme goes, I recommend trying NextGen Gaming's Robin Hood Prince of Tweets. Available on all devices, it is inspired by the story of Robin Hood with a bird twist (yes, strange). Using the SuperBet feature, there is the Robin Hood Arrow feature where the wild can turn adjacent symbols into wilds.\n            ",

The key to unlocking them is the Archery Picker - you can win cash prizes of up to 200 times your bet in 3 of them. The best one is the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature, where you get 7 free spins and blue/red knights battle each other to turn the blue or red symbols on the reels into wilds. \n\nA medieval theme powers Medieval Money, which has 5 reels and 20 paylines. The game is only available on desktop devices (PC or laptop) and can be played from a minimum bet of €0.20 up to €600 per spin. With a clear medieval theme, you don your best shining armor to seek wealth and fun throughout the kingdom. \n\nAesthetically speaking, it features cartoonish graphics with jester hats, targets, kings, queens, princesses, and knights on the reels. The highest-paying symbol is the Medieval Money logo that rewards you with 1,000 times your bet if you manage to get 5 on a payline. \n\nThe king's court is opening up, which means it's time for worthy people to don their best armor and travel through this enchanting kingdom with Medieval Money. Start the bonus game and aim your bow for one of the four bonus missions. \n\nBring in the money with the Money Bags Picker feature, joust with the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature, pick your fortune with Spell Picker, or face the dragon for its treasure in the Dragon Path Bonus feature. Manage all four and you will undoubtedly be the richest person in the land. As you can tell, this game is all about the bonus features, as IGT traditionally does a good job of packaging them. \n\nLoaded with goodies and a cliché theme, Medieval Money is trying to make its mark among IGT games. Such ideals are certainly lofty, so the big question is: can this new game live up to such ambition? There's only one way to find out, so we suggest you keep reading! \n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols \n\nThe Bonus symbol is the target, and 3 of them on any of the 3 central reels trigger the Archery Picker feature - here, you select 1 of 9 targets to reveal a bonus feature: \n\nMoney Bags Picker feature: you can choose 1 of 3 money bags to reveal a cash prize ranging from 2 to 50 times your total bet. \n\nJoust Free Spins Bonus feature - you will receive 7 free spins with the Jousting Wilds Expansion feature. This is played when the red and blue Knight Helmet wild symbols appear on the same row - they will joust to randomly determine the winner. If the blue knight is victorious, all blue symbols on the row between the helmet symbols turn into wilds. If the red knight wins, all red symbols turn into wilds. What's hoped for is that the 2 wilds appear on reels 1 and 5! \n\nThe Spell Picker feature sees a wizard offering 5 mysterious spell bottles - these are worth from 2 to 100 times your total stake. You can choose to accept the offer presented by the wizard or to reject it - up to 5 offers will be made, so make sure to choose wisely. Anything over 25 times your bet is, in my opinion, decent. \n\nFinally, you have the Dragon Path Bonus feature where you spin the wheel - the number of spaces (1, 2 or 3) that the wheel indicates will move you along the path. If the wheel lands on a skull, the feature ends. The farther you progress, the higher the prize on offer - the stake is between 3 and 200 times the total amount to be won. The bet will be 200 times greater if you reach or surpass the Dragon's treasure. \n\nAll in all, Medieval Money is a fun slot game with great winning potential - the Joust Free Spins Bonus feature is the most lucrative as getting a row of free spins can lead to huge wins. \n\nWhile Medieval Money may not have the best graphics that IGT has ever put in a game, it is still one of the best games in terms of overall feel and rewards offered. What this game actually shows is that graphics are not everything and the end-all-be-all of slot games, as it's a game that really grows on you over time, despite its visual doubts. The more you play, the more you will like it. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nAs far as theme goes, I recommend trying NextGen Gaming's Robin Hood Prince of Tweets. Available on all devices, it is inspired by the story of Robin Hood with a bird twist (yes, strange). Using the SuperBet feature, there is the Robin Hood Arrow feature where the wild can turn adjacent symbols into wilds.\n            ",
