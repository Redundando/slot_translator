Questa volta tocca agli Helloween, band tedesca con un seguito di fedelissimi fan e gruppo di riferimento per l’intera scena Power metal. L’ispirazione del gruppo è sempre stato il mondo fantasy, tra sfere magiche, chiavi che aprono porte su universi fantastici e più di un riferimento al Signore degli Anelli di Tolkien. Il logo della band è naturalmente l’immancabile zucca di Halloween. Per creare questa slot la Play’N’Go ha fatto uno sforzo straordinario sia dal punto di vista grafico che del gameplay. La slot si apre con un breve video tratto da un live e con la musica che esplode. I simboli ci trasportano nell’immaginario proprio della band, quello che si ritrova nelle copertine dei loro dischi oltre che nei testi scritti da Kai Hansen, cantante, chitarrista e leader indiscusso del gruppo. La colonna sonora è una selezione di celebri brani, che variano anche in funzione dei simboli Wild e bei giochi Bonus a esso legato.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nGriglia classica per questa slot, con 5 rulli e 3 righe. Le linee di pagamento fisse sono 10, con una scommessa minima che parte da 0,10 € e può raggiungere i 100 €. È possibile attivare tra i 10 e i 100 giri automatici, impostando anche dei limiti di vincita o di perdita. Helloween ha una volatilità media e un RTP pari al 94,2%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nAnche in questa slot le carte da gioco sono i simboli con minor valore. Gli altri simboli sono tratti dalle bellissime copertine della band, a partire da Keeper of the Seven Keys pt. 1 e 2, Walls of Jericho, Pumpkins United. Il simbolo Wild è la zucca di Halloween e sostituisce i simboli eccetto lo Scatter, rappresentato da 7 chiavi che orbitano intorno a una sfera azzurra. Esso ha anche funzione di Wild. tre Scatter assegnano 5 Respins e fanno partire una delle funzioni legate ai Wild. Ognuna riporta il titolo di una famosa canzone degli Helloween, che sarà anche la colonna sonora del nostro gioco bonus. Vediamole da vicino:\n• I’m Alive: i Wilds rimangono fissi sui rulli e si espandono verso l’alto o verso il basso a ogni respin\n• Future World: i Wilds si espandono sull’intero rullo\n• Eagle Fly Free: a ogni respin viene lanciato un nuovo Wild che cambia posizione nel giro successivo\n• Dr Stein: Vine scelto un simbolo iniziale che diventa Wild dopo ogni giro\n• March of Time: i Wild rimangono per tutta la durata dei respin ma si spostano verso sinistra a ogni giro.\n• I Want Out: i simboli Wild esplodono occupando 4 slot\nLe funzioni speciali però non finiscono qua. Infatti, ne esistono altre 2, una che assegna 7 giri gratuiti e l’altra che offre un moltiplicatore x2, x3, x5, x10.\n",

This time, it's dedicated to Helloween, the German band with a loyal fanbase and reference point for the entire Power metal scene. The band has always drawn inspiration from the fantasy world, with magical spheres, keys that open doors to fantastic universes, and more than a few references to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Naturally, the band's logo features the iconic Halloween pumpkin. To create this slot, Play’N’Go has made an extraordinary effort both in terms of graphics and gameplay. The slot opens with a short video taken from a live performance and with explosive music. The symbols transport us into the band's imagination, the same one found on the covers of their records and in the lyrics written by Kai Hansen, the singer, guitarist, and undisputed leader of the group. The soundtrack is a selection of famous songs that also vary depending on the Wild symbols and the bonus games associated with them.\nSlot Features\nThis slot features a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The fixed paylines are 10, with a minimum bet starting at €0.10 and maxing out at €100. You can activate between 10 and 100 automatic spins, setting win or loss limits. Helloween is of medium volatility and has an RTP of 94.2%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nEven in this slot, the playing cards are the symbols with the lowest value. The other symbols are taken from the band's beautiful album covers, starting from Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt. 1 and 2, Walls of Jericho, and Pumpkins United. The Wild symbol is the Halloween pumpkin and replaces symbols except for the Scatter, represented by 7 keys orbiting around a blue sphere. It also functions as a Wild. Three Scatters award 5 Respins and initiate one of the functions related to the Wilds. Each one is named after a famous Helloween song, which is also the soundtrack for our bonus game. Let's take a closer look at them:\n• I'm Alive: Wilds stay fixed on the reels and expand up or down with each respin.\n• Future World: Wilds expand to cover the entire reel.\n• Eagle Fly Free: A new Wild is launched with each respin, changing position on the next spin.\n• Dr. Stein: An initial symbol is chosen and becomes Wild after each spin.\n• March of Time: Wilds remain for the duration of the respins but move to the left with each spin.\n• I Want Out: Wild symbols explode, occupying 4 slots.\nBut the special features don't end there.

This time, it's dedicated to Helloween, the German band with a loyal fanbase and reference point for the entire Power metal scene. The band has always drawn inspiration from the fantasy world, with magical spheres, keys that open doors to fantastic universes, and more than a few references to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Naturally, the band's logo features the iconic Halloween pumpkin. To create this slot, Play’N’Go has made an extraordinary effort both in terms of graphics and gameplay. The slot opens with a short video taken from a live performance and with explosive music. The symbols transport us into the band's imagination, the same one found on the covers of their records and in the lyrics written by Kai Hansen, the singer, guitarist, and undisputed leader of the group. The soundtrack is a selection of famous songs that also vary depending on the Wild symbols and the bonus games associated with them.\nSlot Features\nThis slot features a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The fixed paylines are 10, with a minimum bet starting at €0.10 and maxing out at €100. You can activate between 10 and 100 automatic spins, setting win or loss limits. Helloween is of medium volatility and has an RTP of 94.2%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nEven in this slot, the playing cards are the symbols with the lowest value. The other symbols are taken from the band's beautiful album covers, starting from Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt. 1 and 2, Walls of Jericho, and Pumpkins United. The Wild symbol is the Halloween pumpkin and replaces symbols except for the Scatter, represented by 7 keys orbiting around a blue sphere. It also functions as a Wild. Three Scatters award 5 Respins and initiate one of the functions related to the Wilds. Each one is named after a famous Helloween song, which is also the soundtrack for our bonus game. Let's take a closer look at them:\n• I'm Alive: Wilds stay fixed on the reels and expand up or down with each respin.\n• Future World: Wilds expand to cover the entire reel.\n• Eagle Fly Free: A new Wild is launched with each respin, changing position on the next spin.\n• Dr. Stein: An initial symbol is chosen and becomes Wild after each spin.\n• March of Time: Wilds remain for the duration of the respins but move to the left with each spin.\n• I Want Out: Wild symbols explode, occupying 4 slots.\nBut the special features don't end there.

This game features impressive graphics and gameplay, with a short video taken from a live performance that opens the game and a selection of famous Helloween songs as the soundtrack.\n\nGameplay and Symbols\n\nHelloween has a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, and 10 fixed paylines. Players can bet from €0.10 to €100 and activate up to 100 automatic spins, setting win or loss limits. The symbols, which include playing cards and album covers from Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt.1 and 2, Walls of Jericho, and Pumpkins United, are inspired by the band's fantasy world. The Wild symbol is the Halloween pumpkin, which can replace other symbols except for the Scatter symbol that is represented by 7 keys orbiting around a blue sphere. Three Scatters award 5 Respins and initiate one of the functions related to the Wilds.\n\nBonus Features\n\nHelloween offers a variety of Wild-related bonus features named after famous Helloween songs. The I'm Alive feature has Wilds that remain fixed on the reels and expand up or down with each respin. Future World causes Wilds to expand and cover the entire reel. Eagle Fly Free launches a new Wild with each respin, changing position on the next spin. Dr. Stein chooses an initial symbol, which then becomes Wild after each spin. March of Time involves Wilds that remain for the duration of the respins but move to the left with each spin. Lastly, I Want Out sees Wild symbols explode, occupying 4 slots. Players can also trigger a feature that awards 7 free spins or one that offers a multiplier of x2, x3, x5, or x10.\n\nMusic and Audio\n\nAs a music-themed slot, Helloween's soundtrack is a selection of famous Helloween songs that also vary depending on the Wild symbols and the bonus games associated with them. The game's audio features explosive music, immersing players in the band's world.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nHelloween is of medium volatility and has an RTP of 94.2%, which is slightly lower than the average for online slots. While there is a chance for big wins, players should expect longer stretches between hits. However, the game's bonus features and overall gameplay make it a unique and exciting addition to online casino rosters.\n\n        \n            ",

This time, it's dedicated to Helloween, the German band with a loyal fanbase and reference point for the entire Power metal scene. The band has always drawn inspiration from the fantasy world, with magical spheres, keys that open doors to fantastic universes, and more than a few references to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Naturally, the band's logo features the iconic Halloween pumpkin. To create this slot, Play’N’Go has made an extraordinary effort both in terms of graphics and gameplay. The slot opens with a short video taken from a live performance and with explosive music. The symbols transport us into the band's imagination, the same one found on the covers of their records and in the lyrics written by Kai Hansen, the singer, guitarist, and undisputed leader of the group. The soundtrack is a selection of famous songs that also vary depending on the Wild symbols and the bonus games associated with them.\nSlot Features\nThis slot features a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The fixed paylines are 10, with a minimum bet starting at €0.10 and maxing out at €100. You can activate between 10 and 100 automatic spins, setting win or loss limits. Helloween is of medium volatility and has an RTP of 94.2%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nEven in this slot, the playing cards are the symbols with the lowest value. The other symbols are taken from the band's beautiful album covers, starting from Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt. 1 and 2, Walls of Jericho, and Pumpkins United. The Wild symbol is the Halloween pumpkin and replaces symbols except for the Scatter, represented by 7 keys orbiting around a blue sphere. It also functions as a Wild. Three Scatters award 5 Respins and initiate one of the functions related to the Wilds. Each one is named after a famous Helloween song, which is also the soundtrack for our bonus game. Let's take a closer look at them:\n• I'm Alive: Wilds stay fixed on the reels and expand up or down with each respin.\n• Future World: Wilds expand to cover the entire reel.\n• Eagle Fly Free: A new Wild is launched with each respin, changing position on the next spin.\n• Dr. Stein: An initial symbol is chosen and becomes Wild after each spin.\n• March of Time: Wilds remain for the duration of the respins but move to the left with each spin.\n• I Want Out: Wild symbols explode, occupying 4 slots.\nBut the special features don't end there. In fact, there are 2 more, one that awards 7 free spins and another that offers a multiplier of x2, x3, x5, x10.\n            ",

This time, it's dedicated to Helloween, the German band with a loyal fanbase and reference point for the entire Power metal scene. The band has always drawn inspiration from the fantasy world, with magical spheres, keys that open doors to fantastic universes, and more than a few references to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Naturally, the band's logo features the iconic Halloween pumpkin. To create this slot, Play’N’Go has made an extraordinary effort both in terms of graphics and gameplay. The slot opens with a short video taken from a live performance and with explosive music. The symbols transport us into the band's imagination, the same one found on the covers of their records and in the lyrics written by Kai Hansen, the singer, guitarist, and undisputed leader of the group. The soundtrack is a selection of famous songs that also vary depending on the Wild symbols and the bonus games associated with them.\nSlot Features\nThis slot features a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The fixed paylines are 10, with a minimum bet starting at €0.10 and maxing out at €100. You can activate between 10 and 100 automatic spins, setting win or loss limits. Helloween is of medium volatility and has an RTP of 94.2%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nEven in this slot, the playing cards are the symbols with the lowest value. The other symbols are taken from the band's beautiful album covers, starting from Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt. 1 and 2, Walls of Jericho, and Pumpkins United. The Wild symbol is the Halloween pumpkin and replaces symbols except for the Scatter, represented by 7 keys orbiting around a blue sphere. It also functions as a Wild. Three Scatters award 5 Respins and initiate one of the functions related to the Wilds. Each one is named after a famous Helloween song, which is also the soundtrack for our bonus game. Let's take a closer look at them:\n• I'm Alive: Wilds stay fixed on the reels and expand up or down with each respin.\n• Future World: Wilds expand to cover the entire reel.\n• Eagle Fly Free: A new Wild is launched with each respin, changing position on the next spin.\n• Dr. Stein: An initial symbol is chosen and becomes Wild after each spin.\n• March of Time: Wilds remain for the duration of the respins but move to the left with each spin.\n• I Want Out: Wild symbols explode, occupying 4 slots.\nBut the special features don't end there. In fact, there are 2 more, one that awards 7 free spins and another that offers a multiplier of x2, x3, x5, x10.\n        ",
