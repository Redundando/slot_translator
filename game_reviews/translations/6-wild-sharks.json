Per una ricca ricompensa forse potresti essere tentato, vero? Per scoprirlo non devi fare altro che giocare con la slot 6 Wild Sharks che ha deciso di trattare proprio questo tema insolito legato a un animale così tanto spaventoso. A crearlo è 4ThePlayer che ha costruito un’interessante ambientazione con un tocco innovativo: è in assoluto la prima slot a utilizzare la meccanica Wild Choice. Ciò significa che ogni giocatore potrà andare a personalizzare il suo gioco. Esistono ben 14.983 possibili configurazioni per i Jolly che si bloccano sulla griglia. Inoltre non mancano neanche i giri gratuiti che possono essere scambiati con Wild bloccati. Il tutto viene costruito con un RTP al 96,5% e una vincita massima che arriva a 10.368x della tua scommessa. \nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nIl tema degli squali ci porta subito a pensare a un celebre film che ha posto questo animale al centro di una fortunata saga di successo. Siamo sott’acqua, con un’ambientazione ricostruita ottimamente a livello grafico e in alta definizione. L’atmosfera si arricchisce grazie ai simboli che includono A, K, Q, J e 10 ovvero le classiche carte da gioco. Oltre a questi che hanno un valore più basso, troviamo anche le icone di pesci, tra i quali Razze, Calamari, ma anche Surfisti e Subacquei. Il simbolo più fortunato è in assoluto il surfista che è il più redditizio grazie a un moltiplicatore 1x, 5x, 10x o 30x che trasforma la tua puntata fatta se appare rispettivamente 3, 4, 5 o 6 volte in combinazione.\nLo squalo è il Jolly e ha il potere di sostituire ogni altra icona tranne lo Scatter. Ma ancora più interessanti sono le sue funzionalità, come la funzione Advanced Mode Wild Choice, che permette di posizionare fino a 6 jolly che si bloccano sui rulli, in modo da ottenere un premio superiore. Oppure come la Advanced Mode Wild Choice: ci sono due zone speciali che sono contrassegnate sui rulli 1 e 2, 5 e 6. I Jolly che vengono bloccati resteranno tali per tutti i giri del bonus game, e per ogni simbolo speciale c’è un prezzo fisso che si aggiunge alla tua vincita. Potrai posizionare i tuoi Jolly bloccati al fine di ottenere vincite frequenti.\nE ovviamente citiamo anche i giri gratuiti, che si attivano con due simboli Scatter che atterrano sui rulli 3 e 4, offrendo da 1 A 15 giri in base ai Locked Wild che il giocatore sceglierà. La scelta è personale e i Jolly resteranno in posizione per tutti i giri. \nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot 6 Wild Sharks\nLa slot machine online 6 Wild Sharks è una vera firma innovativa che arricchisce completamente il settore del gambling online. E’ ottimamente pensata e realizzata, potenziata al massimo grazie al suo RTP che permette di ottenere il 56,3% delle vittorie dal gioco base e il 40,2% attraverso le funzioni bonus e soprattutto Free Spin.\nPreparati e mettiti subito in gioco: è tempo di dare la caccia agli squali!\n",

But what if there was a rich reward waiting for you? That's where the slot game, 6 Wild Sharks, comes in, boldly tackling this unusual theme of such a frightening animal. 4ThePlayer created it with an intriguing setting, complete with an innovative touch: it's the first slot to use the Wild Choice mechanic. This means each player can customize their game with 14,983 possible configurations for the wilds that lock onto the grid. There are also free spins that can be traded for locked wilds. The game boasts an RTP of 96.5% and a maximum win of 10,368x the bet.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\nThe shark theme immediately brings to mind a famous movie that put this creature at the center of a successful saga.

In addition to these lower-value symbols, we find icons of fish, including rays, calamari, surfers, and divers. The luckiest symbol by far is the surfer, with a 1x, 5x, 10x, or 30x multiplier that transforms your combination bets if it appears three, four, five, or six times.\n\nThe shark is the wild and has the power to replace any other icon except for the Scatter. But even more interesting are its functions, such as the Advanced Mode Wild Choice, which allows up to six wilds to lock onto the reels, resulting in a higher reward. Or the Advanced Mode Wild Choice: there are two special areas marked on reels 1 and 2, 5 and 6. The wilds that are locked will remain so for all the bonus game rounds, and for each special symbol there is a fixed price that will be added to your win. You can position your locked wilds for frequent wins.\n\nFinally, the game features free spins, activated by two Scatter symbols landing on reels 3 and 4, offering 1 to 15 spins based on the locked wilds the player chooses.

For a chance at a rich reward, maybe you might be tempted, right? To find out, all you have to do is play the 6 Wild Sharks slot game, which has decided to tackle this unusual theme related to such a scary animal. Created by 4ThePlayer, it features an interesting setting with an innovative twist: it is the first slot ever to use the Wild Choice mechanics. This means that each player can customize their own game. There are 14,983 possible configurations for the wilds that appear on the grid. In addition, there are also free spins that can be exchanged for locked wilds. All of this is built with an RTP of 96.5% and a maximum payout of 10,368x your bet.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nThe shark theme immediately brings to mind a famous movie that put this animal at the center of a successful saga. We are underwater, with a well-recreated and high-definition graphic setting. The atmosphere is enriched by symbols that include A, K, Q, J, and 10, which are the classic playing cards. In addition to these, which have a lower value, we also find symbols of fish, including rays, calamari, but also surfers and scuba divers. The luckiest symbol is by far the surfer, which is the most profitable thanks to a 1x, 5x, 10x or 30x multiplier that turns your bet into a winning combination if it appears respectively 3, 4, 5 or 6 times.\n\nThe shark is the wild and has the power to replace any other symbol except the scatter. But even more interesting are its features, such as the Advanced Mode Wild Choice function, which allows you to place up to 6 wilds that lock on the reels, in order to get a higher prize. Or, like the Advanced Mode Wild Choice: there are two special areas that are marked on reels 1 and 2, 5 and 6. The wilds that are locked will remain so for all the bonus game spins, and for each special symbol there is a fixed price that is added to your winnings. You can place your locked wilds to get frequent wins.\n\nAnd of course, we also mention the free spins, which are activated with two scatter symbols landing on reels 3 and 4, offering from 1 to 15 spins based on the locked wilds that the player chooses. The choice is personal and the wilds will remain in position for all spins.\n\nFinal considerations on the 6 Wild Sharks slot\n\nThe online slot machine 6 Wild Sharks is a true innovative signature that completely enriches the online gambling sector. It is excellently designed and developed, maximized thanks to its RTP which allows you to get 56.3% of wins from the base game and 40.2% through bonus functions and, above all, free spins.\n\nGet ready and put yourself in the game now: it's time to hunt sharks!\n            ",

For a chance at a rich reward, maybe you might be tempted, right? To find out, all you have to do is play the 6 Wild Sharks slot game, which has decided to tackle this unusual theme related to such a scary animal. Created by 4ThePlayer, it features an interesting setting with an innovative twist: it is the first slot ever to use the Wild Choice mechanics. This means that each player can customize their own game. There are 14,983 possible configurations for the wilds that appear on the grid. In addition, there are also free spins that can be exchanged for locked wilds. All of this is built with an RTP of 96.5% and a maximum payout of 10,368x your bet.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nThe shark theme immediately brings to mind a famous movie that put this animal at the center of a successful saga. We are underwater, with a well-recreated and high-definition graphic setting. The atmosphere is enriched by symbols that include A, K, Q, J, and 10, which are the classic playing cards. In addition to these, which have a lower value, we also find symbols of fish, including rays, calamari, but also surfers and scuba divers. The luckiest symbol is by far the surfer, which is the most profitable thanks to a 1x, 5x, 10x or 30x multiplier that turns your bet into a winning combination if it appears respectively 3, 4, 5 or 6 times.\n\nThe shark is the wild and has the power to replace any other symbol except the scatter. But even more interesting are its features, such as the Advanced Mode Wild Choice function, which allows you to place up to 6 wilds that lock on the reels, in order to get a higher prize. Or, like the Advanced Mode Wild Choice: there are two special areas that are marked on reels 1 and 2, 5 and 6. The wilds that are locked will remain so for all the bonus game spins, and for each special symbol there is a fixed price that is added to your winnings. You can place your locked wilds to get frequent wins.\n\nAnd of course, we also mention the free spins, which are activated with two scatter symbols landing on reels 3 and 4, offering from 1 to 15 spins based on the locked wilds that the player chooses. The choice is personal and the wilds will remain in position for all spins.\n\nFinal considerations on the 6 Wild Sharks slot\n\nThe online slot machine 6 Wild Sharks is a true innovative signature that completely enriches the online gambling sector. It is excellently designed and developed, maximized thanks to its RTP which allows you to get 56.3% of wins from the base game and 40.2% through bonus functions and, above all, free spins.\n\nGet ready and put yourself in the game now: it's time to hunt sharks!\n            ",
