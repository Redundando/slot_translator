Plus, there are some fun bonus features too! For example, there's the 'Long Live the King' feature where you can pick from several items to manipulate a guillotine and collect rewards. Play the game right, and you might just save the king's head and pocket some winnings!</p>\n\n                <p>But, the best part of the game is the free spins feature. Trigger three or more scatter symbols and unlock the Royal Family's Treasure Chamber. Here, you get to pick from symbols to reveal stacked wilds and free spins to rack up your winnings.</p>\n\n                <p>The minimum bet starts at €0,20, which is a steal for all the fun you're going to have playing Battle Royal.

This game is inspired by the king himself, Henry VIII, and his six wives. Honestly, we can't blame Henry for wanting to get rid of some of his wives. Sometimes people just don't click, right?</p>\n\n    <p>The game features 5 reels and 20 paylines, which gives players plenty of opportunities to strike it lucky. With various symbols representing different characters from Henry's court, you'll be spinning the reels hoping to land a winning combination. Trust us, the excitement of the game will have you feeling like you're right there in the throne room!</p>\n\n    <p>One of the best features of Battle Royal is the bonus games. Yes, that's right, we said games. You can trigger two different bonus games in this slot! In the Long Live the King bonus game, you'll be tasked with choosing chests that are scattered throughout the palace. Each chest will contain a prize, but be careful - one of them will reveal a ghostly apparition of one of Henry's wives. She may not be alive, but she'll still scare you senseless!</p>\n\n    <p>In the other bonus game, The Royal Flush, you'll be transported to a medieval bathroom (yes, you read that right) where you'll select one of Henry's wives to help escape. The wives you choose will reveal cash prizes, but one of them is standing in a trapdoor that will end the game. Choose wisely, or you might find yourself taking a swim in some not-so-clean medieval sewage. Yikes!</p>\n\n    <p>Overall, Battle Royal is a fun and exciting game that will have players hooked from the first spin. The medieval theme is executed perfectly, and the bonus games add an extra layer of thrill and excitement. So, what are you waiting for? Give Battle Royal a spin and see if you can survive Henry VIII's reign!</p>"

Play'n GO has got you covered with their online slot game Battle Royal. This game is inspired by the king himself, Henry VIII, and his six wives. Honestly, we can't blame Henry for wanting to get rid of some of his wives. Sometimes people just don't click, right?</p>\n\n    <p>The game features 5 reels and 20 paylines, which gives players plenty of opportunities to strike it lucky. With various symbols representing different characters from Henry's court, you'll be spinning the reels hoping to land a winning combination. Trust us, the excitement of the game will have you feeling like you're right there in the throne room!</p>\n\n    <p>One of the best features of Battle Royal is the bonus games. Yes, that's right, we said games. You can trigger two different bonus games in this slot! In the Long Live the King bonus game, you'll be tasked with choosing chests that are scattered throughout the palace. Each chest will contain a prize, but be careful - one of them will reveal a ghostly apparition of one of Henry's wives. She may not be alive, but she'll still scare you senseless!</p>\n\n    <p>In the other bonus game, The Royal Flush, you'll be transported to a medieval bathroom (yes, you read that right) where you'll select one of Henry's wives to help escape. The wives you choose will reveal cash prizes, but one of them is standing in a trapdoor that will end the game. Choose wisely, or you might find yourself taking a swim in some not-so-clean medieval sewage. Yikes!</p>\n\n    <p>Overall, Battle Royal is a fun and exciting game that will have players hooked from the first spin. The medieval theme is executed perfectly, and the bonus games add an extra layer of thrill and excitement. So, what are you waiting for? Give Battle Royal a spin and see if you can survive Henry VIII's reign!</p>\"\n}"

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay and Functions\n\nBattle Royal is a 5-reel, 20-payline slot game with high volatility and a maximum winning potential of 5,000 times your bet. The game features standard icons that transform into symbols with consistent winnings. The minimum bet starts at €0,20 and goes up to a maximum limit of €100,00 per round.\n\nBonus Features\n\nBattle Royal has three bonus features: Royal Flush with random activation in the standard game, Free Spins function, and LONG LIVE THE KING function. The latter allows you to choose chests containing prizes in real money, and if you find the Key icon, you'll have a multiplier that will significantly increase your booty of free spins.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nThe symbols in Battle Royal include the card suits with low value, King Henry VIII, and his wives. The King Henry VIII symbol is the wild in the game and rewards you with a 30x bet placed on a pay line. If the Wife symbol is fully visible or shows its upper part, it will be beheaded, turning into an extra wild. Meanwhile, the free spins continue until all five consorts meet the same fate. If the sixth wife manages to escape, you will go directly into the extra feature LONG LIVE THE KING.\n\nBetting Limits\n\nThe minimum bet in Battle Royal is €0,20, and the maximum bet is €100,00 per round. The game is characterized by high volatility and a maximum winning potential of 5,000 times your bet.\n\nTheme and Atmosphere\n\nBattle Royal is inspired by the medieval atmosphere of the Tudor dynasty and is based on the history of Henry VIII and his six wives. The game features sharp guillotines and bloodthirsty executions that add to the theme's authenticity. However, if you're not into historical themes, you might want to check out other slot games, such as Banana Rock, that offer a more fun and upbeat atmosphere.\n\n        \n            ",
