The 5x5 structure shows twenty-five symbols at each game, with forty paylines. Players can customize their gaming experience by modifying the amount of Wild symbols on the reels, which influences the value of winnings that can be obtained.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nKing of Atlantis treats the Atlantis setting well, with the graphics set in the depths of the ocean where the city is. The slot symbols include precious objects such as jewel-encrusted crowns, amethyst rings, golden medallions, ancient amphorae, and lyres. The WILD symbols are represented by illustrations of mermaids, dolphins, and the king of Atlantis. The background music is an epic tune that complements the setting of the slot despite being solemn.\n\nCustomization Options\n\nPlayers can customize their gaming experience by modifying the amount of Wild symbols on the reels, which increases the value of winnings that can be obtained. However, increasing Wild symbols has a cost that players should consider.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nKing of Atlantis is a generous slot that can repay the investment made. Accessing free spins with fixed Wild symbols for each game increases the player's chances of winning. The number of paylines and the number of symbols in the grid contribute to the slot's winning potential.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nAlthough Atlantis is not a frequently exploited theme in the world of online slots, players can find other titles that share the same theme, such as Secrets of Atlantis by NetEnt or Atlantis 3D. Players can also enjoy Mysterious Atlantis.\n\n        \n            ",

The graphics are of excellent quality, bringing players to discover the treasures hidden at the bottom of the ocean. The slot symbols range from precious objects to classic playing cards. The WILD symbols are illustrated by mermaids, dolphins, and the king of Atlantis, and they become animated during winning combinations. The game's background music is epic but can seem out of place with the colorful and fresh setting of the slot. The gaming experience is both complex and unique with its 5*5 structure showing twenty-five symbols at each game, versus the fifteen of ordinary slots. Players can also modify the amount of Wild symbols on the reels to increase their winnings.\n\nCustomization Options\n\nKing of Atlantis offers players the option to customize their gaming experience by modifying the amount of Wild symbols (i.e., Jokers) on the reels. Increasing Wild symbols comes at a cost, but it pays off for the player thanks to the value of winnings that can be obtained.

The IGT slot game, King of Atlantis, takes us to this magical city under the sea, focusing on the figure of its majestic king.\n\nFantasy is a highly appreciated genre in the world of slot games, but few treat an Atlantis setting, and King of Atlantis could be said to be one of the best in terms of graphics.\n\nBut let's talk more about this in the first point of our review of King of Atlantis.\n\nKing of Atlantis - Quality Graphics\n\nOne constant from the IGT production company is the care in the graphics department of most of its slots, and King of Atlantis is no exception in this sense.\n\nKing of Atlantis takes us into the depths of the ocean where the city of Atlantis is situated, illustrated as a treasure-rich seabed. These details are also present in the game grid regarding the slot symbols.\n\nIn fact, we will see precious objects such as jewel-encrusted crowns, amethyst rings, golden medallions, as well as ancient amphorae and lyres, which in King of Atlantis take the place of the classic playing card symbols. The WILD symbols are instead represented by beautiful illustrations of mermaids, dolphins, and, of course, the king of Atlantis that animates during certain combinations.\n\nThe background music that will accompany our games in King of Atlantis is instead an epic tune, perhaps a bit too solemn for the colorful and fresh setting of the slot. Despite this, the audio does not affect the quality of the slot and the gameplay.\n\nKing of Atlantis is an excellent example of how good graphics make playing slots enjoyable. But now, let's talk about the more technical side of this King of Atlantis.\n\nKing of Atlantis - Gameplay Mechanics\n\nWhen opening a slot for the first time, there is often a familiar sensation due to the fact that most online titles use the same mechanics for their game grids. This is not the case with King of Atlantis, which presents a complex and unique grid in its kind.\n\nAlthough forty paylines are being talked about, the grid shows an enormous amount of symbols due to the 5*5 structure that shows twenty-five symbols at each game compared to the fifteen of ordinary slots.\n\nIt is also possible to customize your gaming experience by modifying the amount of Wild symbols (i.e., Jokers) on the reels.

Let's see, for example, Secrets of Atlantis by NetEnt or even Atlantis 3D, to get to Mysterious Atlantis.\n            ",

The IGT slot game, King of Atlantis, takes us to this magical city under the sea, focusing on the figure of its majestic king.\n\nFantasy is a highly appreciated genre in the world of slot games, but few treat an Atlantis setting, and King of Atlantis could be said to be one of the best in terms of graphics.\n\nBut let's talk more about this in the first point of our review of King of Atlantis.\n\nKing of Atlantis - Quality Graphics\n\nOne constant from the IGT production company is the care in the graphics department of most of its slots, and King of Atlantis is no exception in this sense.\n\nKing of Atlantis takes us into the depths of the ocean where the city of Atlantis is situated, illustrated as a treasure-rich seabed. These details are also present in the game grid regarding the slot symbols.\n\nIn fact, we will see precious objects such as jewel-encrusted crowns, amethyst rings, golden medallions, as well as ancient amphorae and lyres, which in King of Atlantis take the place of the classic playing card symbols. The WILD symbols are instead represented by beautiful illustrations of mermaids, dolphins, and, of course, the king of Atlantis that animates during certain combinations.\n\nThe background music that will accompany our games in King of Atlantis is instead an epic tune, perhaps a bit too solemn for the colorful and fresh setting of the slot. Despite this, the audio does not affect the quality of the slot and the gameplay.\n\nKing of Atlantis is an excellent example of how good graphics make playing slots enjoyable. But now, let's talk about the more technical side of this King of Atlantis.\n\nKing of Atlantis - Gameplay Mechanics\n\nWhen opening a slot for the first time, there is often a familiar sensation due to the fact that most online titles use the same mechanics for their game grids. This is not the case with King of Atlantis, which presents a complex and unique grid in its kind.\n\nAlthough forty paylines are being talked about, the grid shows an enormous amount of symbols due to the 5*5 structure that shows twenty-five symbols at each game compared to the fifteen of ordinary slots.\n\nIt is also possible to customize your gaming experience by modifying the amount of Wild symbols (i.e., Jokers) on the reels. Increasing Wild symbols obviously has a cost, but it pays off for the player thanks to the value of winnings that can be obtained.\n\nIn particular, if the player is fortunate enough to access free spins with fixed Wild symbols for each game.\n\nIn our experience, King of Atlantis presented itself as a fun and generous slot to play, which knew how to repay the investment made.\n\nSlots similar to King of Atlantis\n\nThe myth of Atlantis is not one of the most exploited in the world of online slots, but it is still possible to find other titles that share the same theme. Let's see, for example, Secrets of Atlantis by NetEnt or even Atlantis 3D, to get to Mysterious Atlantis.\n        ",
