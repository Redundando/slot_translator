Nolimit City's slot game pays homage to this piece of American history with incredible graphics, rich animations, and an epic soundtrack that will thrill every spin for experienced gamblers.\n\nAn Unusual Grid\nIn Little Bighorn, we find a game grid with 5 reels and a variable number of rows (3-4-5-3-2). The base bet is €0.20 and the ways to win are 360, with a potential win of 23,676 times the bet. Winning combos are those composed of at least three identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. The automatic spins allow us to play without having to click the Play button every time, and thanks to the win and loss limits, we don't have to worry about anything. The volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.06%, a value that varies when playing bonus games.\n\nMany Bonuses for Super Wins\nUnlike many other slot games, Little Bighorn does not feature playing card symbols, but only thematic ones. The lower value symbols are the knife, gun, mace, rifle, and ax. Following these, we have the more lucrative symbols: Two Moons, Captain Thomas Custer, Crazy Horse, Colonel George Custer, and Sitting Bull. We have several Wild and Scatter symbols, each with a different function. The Wild symbol is our classic Joker and replaces all symbols except the special ones.\n\nThen there is the Scalp Wild, which can only land on the third reel and turns all American soldiers into Jokers. Furthermore, it expands to the entire reel. For every American scalp obtained, a +1 multiplier is awarded. The other special symbol is the Totem Wild, also expanding. If it appears 3 times, it awards 8 Free Spins. With the No Mercy Scatter symbol, a special function is activated. The No Mercy Scatter symbol moves to the left, revealing one of the following special symbols:\n\nSitting Bull: turns its symbols into expanding Wilds\nCrazy Horse: turns its symbols into Wilds and adds a +1 multiplier to each symbol\nTwo Moons: turns all its symbols into Wilds\n\nSpecial functions can also be purchased by clicking on the star symbol.\n\nFAQs\nCan I also play Little Bighorn on my mobile phone?\n\nOf course, this slot is available on any device.\n\nWhat is the maximum win?\n\nWith Little Bighorn, you can aspire to win up to 23,676 times your bet!\n\nHow many ways to win are there in Little Bighorn?\n\nThere are 360 ways to win in Little Bighorn.\n            ",

The base bet is €0.20 and the ways to win are 360, with a potential win of 23,676 times the bet. Winning combos are those composed of at least three identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. With high volatility, gamblers can expect an exciting and unpredictable experience, supported by a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.06%.\n\nThematic Symbols and Special Features\n\nLittle Bighorn only offers thematic symbols to create winning combinations, such as the knife, gun, mace, rifle, and ax. The higher paying symbols are real historical figures, including Captain Thomas Custer, Colonel George Custer, Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, and Two Moons. In addition to the classic Joker Wild symbol, players can also take advantage of special symbols. The Scalp Wild turns all American soldiers into Jokers when it lands on the third reel, and expands to the entire reel. The Totem Wild also expands, and if it appears three times, it awards 8 free spins. The No Mercy Scatter symbol activates unique functions for Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, or Two Moons. These special features can also be purchased by clicking on the star symbol.\n\nRewarding Bonuses for Players\n\nLittle Bighorn offers an exciting range of bonuses and rewards for players. The Scalp Wild adds a +1 multiplier for every American scalp obtained, meaning big payouts are possible. The Totem Wild awards 8 free spins when it appears three times, offering more chances for players to win big. The No Mercy Scatter symbol activates special functions for Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, or Two Moons. Finally, players can also purchase special features by clicking on the star symbol.\n\nThematic Design and High RTP\n\nLittle Bighorn's thematic design creates an immersive experience for players. The graphics, animations, and epic soundtrack all pay homage to the conflict between Native Americans and the United States Army. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.06%, which is a solid value for gamblers looking for a high potential payout. However, it's important to note that the RTP varies when playing bonus games and features.\n\nMobile Compatibility for On-the-Go Gaming\n\nLittle Bighorn is available to play on any device, with mobile compatibility allowing for on-the-go gaming. This means that players can access the exciting gameplay and features from anywhere, anytime. Whether on a smartphone or tablet, the graphics and animations remain top-notch, providing a thrilling slot game experience.\n\n        \n            ",

Nolimit City's slot game pays homage to this piece of American history with incredible graphics, rich animations, and an epic soundtrack that will thrill every spin for experienced gamblers.\n\nAn Unusual Grid\nIn Little Bighorn, we find a game grid with 5 reels and a variable number of rows (3-4-5-3-2). The base bet is €0.20 and the ways to win are 360, with a potential win of 23,676 times the bet. Winning combos are those composed of at least three identical symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. The automatic spins allow us to play without having to click the Play button every time, and thanks to the win and loss limits, we don't have to worry about anything. The volatility is high, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.06%, a value that varies when playing bonus games.\n\nMany Bonuses for Super Wins\nUnlike many other slot games, Little Bighorn does not feature playing card symbols, but only thematic ones. The lower value symbols are the knife, gun, mace, rifle, and ax. Following these, we have the more lucrative symbols: Two Moons, Captain Thomas Custer, Crazy Horse, Colonel George Custer, and Sitting Bull. We have several Wild and Scatter symbols, each with a different function. The Wild symbol is our classic Joker and replaces all symbols except the special ones.\n\nThen there is the Scalp Wild, which can only land on the third reel and turns all American soldiers into Jokers. Furthermore, it expands to the entire reel. For every American scalp obtained, a +1 multiplier is awarded. The other special symbol is the Totem Wild, also expanding. If it appears 3 times, it awards 8 Free Spins. With the No Mercy Scatter symbol, a special function is activated. The No Mercy Scatter symbol moves to the left, revealing one of the following special symbols:\n\nSitting Bull: turns its symbols into expanding Wilds\nCrazy Horse: turns its symbols into Wilds and adds a +1 multiplier to each symbol\nTwo Moons: turns all its symbols into Wilds\n\nSpecial functions can also be purchased by clicking on the star symbol.\n\nFAQs\nCan I also play Little Bighorn on my mobile phone?\n\nOf course, this slot is available on any device.\n\nWhat is the maximum win?\n\nWith Little Bighorn, you can aspire to win up to 23,676 times your bet!\n\nHow many ways to win are there in Little Bighorn?\n\nThere are 360 ways to win in Little Bighorn.\n        ",
