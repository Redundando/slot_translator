    "original_text": "\nBook of Sheba\nBook of Sheba è una nuova release di iSoftBet, e un altro gioco in cui stanno cercando di seguire il genere ispirato a Book of Ra, la Slot per eccellenza che i giocatori amano. Ci sono un sacco di aziende diverse che stanno provando la stessa cosa, sia clonando esattamente l’originale, sia portando innovazioni più o meno grandi nei loro giochi. iSoftBet sembra cercare di innovare un po’ con questo, come stai per scoprire.\nCon le sue 5 bobine e le 10 linee attive, Book of Sheba si presenta come qualsiasi altro gioco della sua categoria, e anche le vincite fino a 5.000x la posta in gioco sono le stesse. Con un’alta volatilità, ma anche con un RTP del 96%, il gioco finisce per fare un lavoro ragionevole.\nUna grafica regale\nLa slot Book of Sheba è basata sulla regina Saba. Dal design opulento, ha un’atmosfera araba con una colonna sonora incantevole. Incastonati nel palazzo della Regina Saba, i rulli sono racchiusi in oro e gioielli. La grafica è luminosa e colorata, ma di buon gusto.\nI simboli sono A, K, Q, J e 10, ossia le carte da Poker di basso valore. Poi si vedono collane, maschere, leoni e la stessa Regina di Saba. Lei è il simbolo più prezioso, poiché 2, 3, 4 o 5 su una linea di pagamento pagheranno rispettivamente 1, 10, 100 o 500 volte la vostra quota totale.\nIl simbolo principale di Book of Sheba è il simbolo Wild e Scatter. Sostituendo tutti i simboli per darti un risultato di vincita, 3, 4 o 5 di questi simboli pagheranno 2x, 20x o 200x la tua puntata, oltre a far scattare l’importantissima funzione Free Spins.\nBen progettata, questa Slot può essere giocata su dispositivi desktop, mobile e tablet come standard. Questo perché lo sviluppatore iSoftBet crea tutti i suoi slot utilizzando la tecnologia HTML5.\nÈ un gioco a tema egiziano, iSoftBet non si è allontanato troppo dal sentiero battuto in questo gioco. Hanno usato una buona grafica, moderna, ma con il solito mix di carte da Poker e simboli a tema di alto valore (Regina, Leone, Maschera, Broccia). Il simbolo della funzione Wild è il Libro, e la variante del Libro d’Oro che è un extra durante i giri liberi.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nAttenzione al simbolo del libro, perché questo è lo Scatter. 3, 4 o 5 in qualsiasi punto in vista attiveranno la funzione Giri liberi. Riceverai 10 giri gratis con 2, 20 o 200 volte la tua puntata totale come premio in denaro.\nPrima dell’inizio dei giri gratuiti, viene scelto a caso uno speciale simbolo di espansione. Potete accettarlo o rifiutarlo nella speranza di ottenere un simbolo più redditizio. Se si rifiuta il primo simbolo, si deve accettare il secondo.\nQuando il simbolo speciale in espansione atterra, si impadronirà dell’intera bobina per aumentare il vostro potenziale di vincita o per creare una vittoria. I simboli speciali in espansione non hanno bisogno di essere sui rulli adiacenti per dare una vincita, il che fa una grande differenza. .\nTieni d’occhio la dispersione, poiché 3 o più di essi recupereranno la caratteristica e ti daranno altri 10 giri gratis. Non ci sono limiti al numero di giri gratuiti che si possono vincere.\nAncora più importante, i simboli appaiono sui rulli 2, 3 e 4 (i 3 rulli centrali). Quando uno atterra, il reel set si trasformerà e diventerà d’oro per tutta la durata dei giri liberi. Quando una bobina è d’oro, si trasforma ogni volta in uno speciale simbolo in espansione.\nSe si ottengono 3 bobine d’oro e si fa atterrare il simbolo speciale di espansione sulla bobina 1, tutte e 4 le bobine saranno sostituite dal simbolo speciale di espansione. Questo aumenta le possibilità di riempire le bobine con il simbolo speciale di espansione. Il tuo potenziale di vincita dipende da quale simbolo è quello speciale che si espande.\nPotete effettuare lo Spin a partire da soli 10 centesimi per ogni giro. La puntata massima è di 10 euro a giro. C’è una funzione standard di Auto Spins dove si può scegliere tra 5 e 1.000 auto spin. Se volete, potete impostare dei limiti di perdita e fermarvi se una vincita raggiunge un importo scelto.\nBook of Sheba è una slot altamente volatile. Essendo una slot della saga ‘Book of’, le grandi vincite saranno poche e lontane tra loro. Tuttavia, è tutta una questione di giri gratis, dove ottenere un simbolo speciale di alto valore che si espande può portare ad enormi vincite. La vincita massima è di 5.000x la tua puntata per spin o free spin. Questo moltiplicatore può essere vinto se si riempiono i rulli con il simbolo della Regina Saba di alto valore.\nL’RTP è del 96% per il gioco normale. Se si opta per la funzione Ultra Bet, l’RTP arriva fino al 96,5%.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nLa slot Book of Sheba vi ricorderà le slot Book of Ra Deluxe di Novomatic e Book of Dead di Play ‘n GO’s. Concentrati sulla funzione Free Spins, dove troverai il simbolo di espansione speciale comunemente usato. La particolarità è che la Slot trasforma le bobine in bobine d’oro in modo che lo speciale simbolo di espansione riempia le bobine d’oro su ogni giro gratis.\nSe riesci ad ottenere 3 rulli d’oro e un simbolo di alto valore come il simbolo d’espansione speciale, vincerai un sacco di soldi. L’RTP è inferiore a Book of Dead, ma il colpo di scena nei giri liberi e l’aggiunta della funzione Ultra Bet fanno di Book of Sheba una slot da prendere in considerazione se vi piace questo tipo di gioco.\n",

With its pyramids, hieroglyphs, mummies and curses, Ancient Egypt can be considered a constant in the world of online slots. More and more titles are exploiting this theme, just like Betixon's Book of Sheba. In this review, we'll take a look at this title so that you know exactly what you're dealing with before even opening it.\n\nAnimations and Superheroines:\nIt’s not often that one is surprised by opening a slot, but Betixon's Book of Sheba is certainly one that surprises. Even before seeing the playing grid, we see a girl reminiscent of Marvel superheroes in the foreground, armed with a scepter and cat ears. A peculiar choice, especially since she is animated and spins the staff. The animations are not the best, both for the girl (probably the Goddess Bastet) and for the fire of the torches, animated with just a handful of frames per second. Despite this, the presence of these two factors manages to give an identity to the slot that is often absent in titles with this theme. The playing grid is quite small, which is a shame: the various deities are inside in a game of shapes and colors and unfortunately difficult to appreciate due to the size. Everything is surrounded by a dark atmospheric music that makes us feel in danger but also close to an exciting discovery.\n\nHow to play Book of Sheba?\nNow let's move on to the technical aspect: The grid is of the 5*3 type, with five reels (although they are not exactly reels but symbols in cascade that show 3 symbols each. The difference between reels and cascade of symbols lies in the possibility of getting concatenated wins: every time we get winning combinations, in fact, the symbols involved will disappear and make way for other symbols falling from the top. In this way, it is possible to obtain numerous wins in a single round, also thanks to the 243 paylines. Among the various symbols to pay attention to, we find the cat (a sacred animal in ancient Egypt), which is a Scatter symbol that allows you to reach the bonus mode, and the book, which acts as a Wild symbol capable of replacing any other symbol in play.\n\nSlots similar to Book of Sheba:\nIf you're looking for other slots that exploit Egypt as a theme, you won't need to try too hard: there are dozens of titles that can offer you this world in all its variations: among these are Novomatic's Egyptian Experience, Pragmatic Play's Mysterious Egypt, and IGT's Mistress of Egypt. These slots generally focus on one of the many faces of this world: Cleopatra, Tutankhamun, the Pyramids, the Deities, and much more.",

With its pyramids, hieroglyphs, mummies, and curses, Ancient Egypt can be considered a constant in the world of online slots. More and more titles exploit this theme, just like Book of Sheba from Betixon.\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at this title so that you can know exactly what you have in front of you, even before opening it. Animations and superheroines don't often surprise you when you open a slot, but that's certainly what happens when we discover Book of Sheba from Betixon.\n\nEven before seeing the game grid, we see a girl who resembles a Marvel superheroine, armed with a scepter and with cat ears. A peculiar choice, especially since she is animated and spins the stick. The animations are not the best, both for the girl (probably the Goddess Bastet) and for the fire of the torches, animated with a handful of frames per second.\n\nDespite this, the mere presence of these two factors manages to give an identity to the slot often absent in titles with this theme. The game grid is rather small, which is a shame: the various deities are inside in a game of shapes and colors and it is unfortunately difficult to appreciate them due to their size. The whole thing is surrounded by a dark atmospheric music that makes us feel in danger but also close to an exciting discovery.\n\nHow to play Book of Sheba?\n\nLet's move on to the technical aspect: the grid is of type 5*3, with five reels (although they are not really reels but falling symbols that show 3 symbols each). The difference between reels and falling symbols lies in the possibility of obtaining concatenated wins: every time we obtain winning combinations, in fact, the involved symbols will disappear and leave room for other symbols falling from above.\n\nIn this way, it is possible to obtain numerous wins in a single round, also thanks to the 243 paylines. Among the various symbols to which it is advisable to pay attention, there is the cat (sacred animal in ancient Egypt), which is a Scatter symbol that allows you to reach the bonus mode, and the book, which serves as a Wild symbol capable of replacing any other symbol in the game.\n\nSlots similar to Book of Sheba\n\nIf you are looking for other slots that exploit Egypt as a theme, you do not need to try too hard: there are dozens of titles that can offer you this world in all its forms: among these we find Egyptian Experience by Novomatic, Mysterious Egypt by Pragmatic Play, and Mistress of Egypt by IGT.\n\nThese slots generally focus on one of the many faces of this world: Cleopatra, Tutankhamun, the Pyramids, the Deities, and much more.\n            ",

The sound design enriches the game experience with specific sound effects each time a payline is filled and when the bonus round is reached, making it very immersive.\n\nCompetition\n\nBook of Sheba is one of the many slots inspired by Ancient Egypt's theme. Other titles you may enjoy are Egyptian Experience by Novomatic, Mysterious Egypt by Pragmatic Play, and Mistress of Egypt by IGT. These slots generally focus on one of the many faces of this world: Cleopatra, Tutankhamun, the Pyramids, the Deities, and much more.\n\n        \n            ",

The slot has 243 paylines and features a Scatter symbol in the form of a cat and a Wild symbol in the form of a book.\n\nTheme\n\nBook of Sheba draws its theme from Ancient Egypt, a period shrouded in mystery and surrounded by fascination. The slot captures the essence of Ancient Egypt with symbols and icons such as pyramids, hieroglyphs, mummies, and curses.\n\nGraphics and Animations\n\nBook of Sheba features a peculiar and refreshing choice of animation and graphics, with a girl who resembles a Marvel superheroine, armed with a scepter and with cat ears appearing even before the game grid.

Despite these shortcomings, the animations and graphics add an identity to the slot that is often absent in other titles with a similar theme.

The music complements the theme of Ancient Egypt and contributes to the overall suspenseful atmosphere of the game.\n\nComparison with Similar Slots\n\nBook of Sheba is one of many titles that explore the theme of Ancient Egypt in the world of online slots. Other slots that focus on various aspects of this theme include Egyptian Experience by Novomatic, Mysterious Egypt by Pragmatic Play, and Mistress of Egypt by IGT.

The slot also offers the opportunity to obtain numerous wins in a single round with its falling symbols and has a Wild symbol and a Scatter symbol to further increase the chances of winning.\n\n        \n            ",

With its pyramids, hieroglyphs, mummies, and curses, Ancient Egypt can be considered a constant in the world of online slots. More and more titles exploit this theme, just like Book of Sheba from Betixon.\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at this title so that you can know exactly what you have in front of you, even before opening it. Animations and superheroines don't often surprise you when you open a slot, but that's certainly what happens when we discover Book of Sheba from Betixon.\n\nEven before seeing the game grid, we see a girl who resembles a Marvel superheroine, armed with a scepter and with cat ears. A peculiar choice, especially since she is animated and spins the stick. The animations are not the best, both for the girl (probably the Goddess Bastet) and for the fire of the torches, animated with a handful of frames per second.\n\nDespite this, the mere presence of these two factors manages to give an identity to the slot often absent in titles with this theme. The game grid is rather small, which is a shame: the various deities are inside in a game of shapes and colors and it is unfortunately difficult to appreciate them due to their size. The whole thing is surrounded by a dark atmospheric music that makes us feel in danger but also close to an exciting discovery.\n\nHow to play Book of Sheba?\n\nLet's move on to the technical aspect: the grid is of type 5*3, with five reels (although they are not really reels but falling symbols that show 3 symbols each). The difference between reels and falling symbols lies in the possibility of obtaining concatenated wins: every time we obtain winning combinations, in fact, the involved symbols will disappear and leave room for other symbols falling from above.\n\nIn this way, it is possible to obtain numerous wins in a single round, also thanks to the 243 paylines. Among the various symbols to which it is advisable to pay attention, there is the cat (sacred animal in ancient Egypt), which is a Scatter symbol that allows you to reach the bonus mode, and the book, which serves as a Wild symbol capable of replacing any other symbol in the game.\n\nSlots similar to Book of Sheba\n\nIf you are looking for other slots that exploit Egypt as a theme, you do not need to try too hard: there are dozens of titles that can offer you this world in all its forms: among these we find Egyptian Experience by Novomatic, Mysterious Egypt by Pragmatic Play, and Mistress of Egypt by IGT.\n\nThese slots generally focus on one of the many faces of this world: Cleopatra, Tutankhamun, the Pyramids, the Deities, and much more.\n            ",

With its pyramids, hieroglyphs, mummies, and curses, Ancient Egypt can be considered a constant in the world of online slots. More and more titles exploit this theme, just like Book of Sheba from Betixon.\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at this title so that you can know exactly what you have in front of you, even before opening it. Animations and superheroines don't often surprise you when you open a slot, but that's certainly what happens when we discover Book of Sheba from Betixon.\n\nEven before seeing the game grid, we see a girl who resembles a Marvel superheroine, armed with a scepter and with cat ears. A peculiar choice, especially since she is animated and spins the stick. The animations are not the best, both for the girl (probably the Goddess Bastet) and for the fire of the torches, animated with a handful of frames per second.\n\nDespite this, the mere presence of these two factors manages to give an identity to the slot often absent in titles with this theme. The game grid is rather small, which is a shame: the various deities are inside in a game of shapes and colors and it is unfortunately difficult to appreciate them due to their size. The whole thing is surrounded by a dark atmospheric music that makes us feel in danger but also close to an exciting discovery.\n\nHow to play Book of Sheba?\n\nLet's move on to the technical aspect: the grid is of type 5*3, with five reels (although they are not really reels but falling symbols that show 3 symbols each). The difference between reels and falling symbols lies in the possibility of obtaining concatenated wins: every time we obtain winning combinations, in fact, the involved symbols will disappear and leave room for other symbols falling from above.\n\nIn this way, it is possible to obtain numerous wins in a single round, also thanks to the 243 paylines.
