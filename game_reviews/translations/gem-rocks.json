Based on a race of characters made of rock in a world of stones and gems, it offers cascading wins, up to 4x4 cluster symbols and win-all-ways payouts.\nRock-solid Design\nThe ground moves and the mountains shake when this fearsome tribe of gentle giants decides it’s time to rack up some wins in our February version of Gem Rocks! The real beauty of this rough diamond lies in how the combination of cascading wins, cluster symbols and win-all-ways gives you the chance to end every spin with a monstrous win. Add to this the fact that consecutive wins add a cluster of up to 4x4 symbols with a guaranteed win on the reels, and you know you have a real gem on your hands!\nThe man who walked on the moon caused quite a stir in 1969, but no one thought to tell us about the race of gemstone giants that inhabit it. Fortunately, the Gem Rocks slot machines transport you directly into a sparkling moon landscape where these friendly monsters will do their best to give you some shiny souvenirs to take back to earth every time you play the Gem Rocks slot machine. Essentially, the Gem Rocks online slot has a Tetris-like atmosphere, with an assortment of brightly colored gems falling and dropping from the bottom of the screen during winning combos; the net result can be one win after another during hot Gem Rocks mobile slot sessions. This makes the Gem Rocks slot machine inherently satisfying.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nVisually, Gem Rocks looks stunning – like all Yggdrasil Gaming slots to be honest. Set in a world of stones and gems, it features gentle giants with hearts of gemstones! Set against a rocky, mountainous terrain, this fast-paced game is thrilling and has an epic feel to it. Symbols on the reels include 8 regular stones/gems – the most rewarding being the star that gives you 75 coins for 5 in a cluster.\nWhen you get a winning combo, the Cascading Wins feature is triggered – the contributing symbols disappear from the screen, leaving space for new symbols. New symbols continue to come until you get winning combos.\nThe main attraction of the slot is the Gem Rock feature – which is triggered when you get 2, 5 and 9 consecutive cascading wins. You can track your progress with the gem meter on the screen. Once activated, a single Gem Rock lands on top of the reels – this is made up of identical symbols. The more times you win consecutively, the bigger the Gem Rock:\n2 consecutive wins = 2x2 Gem Rock\n5 consecutive wins = 3x3 Gem Rock\n9 consecutive wins = 4x4 Gem Rock\nEssentially explained, Gem Rocks fall that display the same symbol – this makes it easier to form winning combos. The key is to get 9 or more consecutive wins to get the big 4x4 Gem Rock that can lead to big wins. If you get a 4x4 Gem Rock made up of the high-value star stone/gem, this can lead to big wins. As for variety, it’s medium to high, with a maximum win of 2,500 times your bet on each spin.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you like Gem Rocks, I recommend trying some of Yggdrasil Gaming's other superb slots like Valley of the Gods and Vikings Go Berzerk 2.

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Gem Rocks\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nGem Rocks\nGem Rocks is a 6-reels, 4,096 ways-to-win slot game powered by Yggdrasil Gaming, playable from €0.25 to €100 per spin on all devices. Based on a race of characters made of rocks in a world of stones and gems, it offers cascading wins, up to 4×4 cluster symbols and win-all-ways payout.\nA rocky graphic\nThe terrain shifts and the mountains move when this tremendous tribe of kind-hearted giants decides it's time to accumulate some wins in our February version of Gem Rocks! The real beauty of this rough diamond lies in how the combination of cascading wins, cluster symbols and win-all-ways gives you the chance to finish every round with a monstrous win. Add to this the fact that consecutive wins add up to a cluster of up to 4×4 symbols with a guaranteed win on the reels, and you will know that you have a true gem in your hands!\nThe man who set foot on the moon caused quite a stir in 1969, but no one thought to tell us about the race of gems giants that inhabit there. Fortunately, Gem Rocks slots catapult you directly into a glittering lunar landscape where these friendly monsters will do their best to give you some sparkling souvenirs to bring back to Earth every time you play Gem Rocks slot machine. In essence, the online Gem Rocks slot has a Tetris-like atmosphere, with an assortment of brightly colored gems falling when touched and falling from the bottom of the screen during winning tailhooks; the net result can be win after win during hot Gem Rocks mobile slot sessions. This makes the Gem Rocks slot machine inherently satisfying.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nVisually, Gem Rocks looks stunning - like all Yggdrasil Gaming slots to be honest. Embedded in a world of rocks and gems, it's characterized by kind-hearted giants with gemstone hearts! Set on a rocky and mountainous terrain, this fast-paced game is exciting and has an epic feel. The symbols on the rules include 8 regular stones/gems - the most rewarding being the star that gives you 75 coins for 5 in a cluster.\nWhen you get a winning combination, the Cascade Wins feature is activated - the contributing symbols disappear from the screen, leaving space for new symbols. The new symbols keep coming until you get winning combinations.\nThe main attraction of the slot is the Gem Rock feature - which is activated when you get 2, 5 and 9 consecutive cascade wins. You can track your progress with the gem meter on the screen. Once activated, a single Gem Rock lands on top of the reels - this is built with identical symbols. The more times you win consecutively, the bigger the Gem Rock:\n2 consecutive wins = 2x2 Gem Rock\n5 consecutive wins = 3x3 Gem Rock\n9 consecutive wins = 4x4 Gem Rock\nSubstantially explained, Gem Rocks Gem falls that show the same symbol - this allows you to easily form winning combinations more easily. The key is to get 9 or more consecutive wins to get the big 4x4 Gem Rock that can lead to big wins. If you get a 4x4 Gem Rock composed of the high-value star stone/gem, this can lead to big wins. As far as variety is concerned, it is from medium to high, with a maximum win of 2,500 times your bet on each spin.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you like Gem Rocks, I recommend trying some of Yggdrasil Gaming's other superb slots like Valley of the Gods and Vikings Go Berzerk 2. In the first case, you will find yourself playing and betting your money in the legendary world of Ancient Egypt and you can win up to €580,000 with a single bet.\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay Features\nMaximum Win Potential\nVisual Aesthetics\nBet Range\nCompatibility\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Gem Rocks\nGem Rocks is a 6-reels, 4,096 ways-to-win slot game powered by Yggdrasil Gaming, playable from €0.25 to €100 per spin on all devices. Based on a race of characters made of rocks in a world of stones and gems, it offers cascading wins, up to 4×4 cluster symbols and win-all-ways payout.\nA rocky graphic\nThe terrain shifts and the mountains move when this tremendous tribe of kind-hearted giants decides it's time to accumulate some wins in our February version of Gem Rocks! The real beauty of this rough diamond lies in how the combination of cascading wins, cluster symbols and win-all-ways gives you the chance to finish every round with a monstrous win. Add to this the fact that consecutive wins add up to a cluster of up to 4×4 symbols with a guaranteed win on the reels, and you will know that you have a true gem in your hands!\nThe man who set foot on the moon caused quite a stir in 1969, but no one thought to tell us about the race of gems giants that inhabit there. Fortunately, Gem Rocks slots catapult you directly into a glittering lunar landscape where these friendly monsters will do their best to give you some sparkling souvenirs to bring back to Earth every time you play Gem Rocks slot machine. In essence, the online Gem Rocks slot has a Tetris-like atmosphere, with an assortment of brightly colored gems falling when touched and falling from the bottom of the screen during winning tailhooks; the net result can be win after win during hot Gem Rocks mobile slot sessions. This makes the Gem Rocks slot machine inherently satisfying.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nVisually, Gem Rocks looks stunning - like all Yggdrasil Gaming slots to be honest. Embedded in a world of rocks and gems, it's characterized by kind-hearted giants with gemstone hearts! Set on a rocky and mountainous terrain, this fast-paced game is exciting and has an epic feel. The symbols on the rules include 8 regular stones/gems - the most rewarding being the star that gives you 75 coins for 5 in a cluster.\nWhen you get a winning combination, the Cascade Wins feature is activated - the contributing symbols disappear from the screen, leaving space for new symbols. The new symbols keep coming until you get winning combinations.\nThe main attraction of the slot is the Gem Rock feature - which is activated when you get 2, 5 and 9 consecutive cascade wins. You can track your progress with the gem meter on the screen. Once activated, a single Gem Rock lands on top of the reels - this is built with identical symbols. The more times you win consecutively, the bigger the Gem Rock:\n2 consecutive wins = 2x2 Gem Rock\n5 consecutive wins = 3x3 Gem Rock\n9 consecutive wins = 4x4 Gem Rock\nSubstantially explained, Gem Rocks Gem falls that show the same symbol - this allows you to easily form winning combinations more easily. The key is to get 9 or more consecutive wins to get the big 4x4 Gem Rock that can lead to big wins. If you get a 4x4 Gem Rock composed of the high-value star stone/gem, this can lead to big wins. As far as variety is concerned, it is from medium to high, with a maximum win of 2,500 times your bet on each spin.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you like Gem Rocks, I recommend trying some of Yggdrasil Gaming's other superb slots like Valley of the Gods and Vikings Go Berzerk 2. In the first case, you will find yourself playing and betting your money in the legendary world of Ancient Egypt and you can win up to €580,000 with a single bet.\n            ",

Players can track their progress with the gem meter on the screen, and once activated, a single Gem Rock lands on top of the reels, built with identical symbols. The size of the Gem Rock increases with the number of consecutive wins, reaching 4x4 symbols when players hit 9 consecutive wins.\n\nVisuals\n\nGem Rocks features a rocky and mountainous terrain, with a race of gemstone giants as the main characters of the game. The symbols on the reels include eight regular stones/gems, beautifully designed with bright colors. The game is embedded in a world of stones, gems, and epic feel, making it a stunning visual experience for players.\n\nWinning Potential\n\nGem Rocks slot offers players medium to high variety, with a maximum win of 2,500 times their bet on each spin. The cascading wins, cluster symbols, and win-all-ways payout give players many opportunities to win big. The Gem Rock feature is the key to boost players' winnings, as the bigger the Gem Rock, the higher the potential payouts. Getting a 4x4 Gem Rock composed of the high-value star stone/gem can lead to significant wins.\n\nCompatibility\n\nGem Rocks is playable on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile. Players can enjoy the game on their smartphones on-the-go or on the comfort of their home using their desktop or tablet devices. The game adapts to any screen size, keeping its stunning visuals and immersive gameplay intact.\n\n        \n            ",

The Cascade Wins feature is activated whenever you get a winning combination, and the contributing symbols disappear from the screen, leaving space for new symbols to appear. The main attraction of the slot is the Gem Rock feature, which is activated when you get 2, 5, and 9 consecutive cascade wins. It allows you to easily form winning combinations by showing the same symbol. Once activated, a single Gem Rock lands on top of the reels and is built with identical symbols. The more times you win consecutively, the bigger the Gem Rock can get.\n\nMaximum Win Potential\n\nThe maximum win potential in Gem Rocks is 2,500 times your bet on each spin. The key to achieving this is to get 9 or more consecutive wins to trigger the big 4x4 Gem Rock that can lead to significant wins. If you get a 4x4 Gem Rock composed of the high-value star stone/gem, this can lead to big wins. The variety is from medium to high, making it a decent option for people looking for a balance between frequent payouts and high wins.\n\nVisual Aesthetics\n\nVisually, Gem Rocks is stunning, like most Yggdrasil Gaming slots. Set on a rocky and mountainous terrain, the environment is characterized by kind-hearted giants with gemstone hearts. The symbols on the reels include 8 regular stones/gems, with the most rewarding being the star that gives you 75 coins for 5 in a cluster. The game's Tetris-like atmosphere, with an assortment of brightly colored gems falling when touched and falling from the bottom of the screen during winning tailhooks, gives players an inherently satisfying experience.\n\nBet Range\n\nGem Rocks is playable from €0.25 to €100 per spin on all devices. The broad range caters to different players' budgets, making Gem Rocks a flexible option for gamers with both low and high slots gaming budgets.\n\nCompatibility\n\nGem Rocks is available to play on all devices, making it easy to access and play on-the-go. It is a browser-based game that requires no download, so players can instantly start playing on smartphones, tablets, PCs, or laptops. The game's compatibility with different devices gives players the freedom to choose how they play and when they play, making it a convenient option for gamers who love versatility.\n\n        \n            ",

Based on a race of characters made of rocks in a world of stones and gems, it offers cascading wins, up to 4×4 cluster symbols and win-all-ways payout.\nA rocky graphic\nThe terrain shifts and the mountains move when this tremendous tribe of kind-hearted giants decides it's time to accumulate some wins in our February version of Gem Rocks! The real beauty of this rough diamond lies in how the combination of cascading wins, cluster symbols and win-all-ways gives you the chance to finish every round with a monstrous win. Add to this the fact that consecutive wins add up to a cluster of up to 4×4 symbols with a guaranteed win on the reels, and you will know that you have a true gem in your hands!\nThe man who set foot on the moon caused quite a stir in 1969, but no one thought to tell us about the race of gems giants that inhabit there. Fortunately, Gem Rocks slots catapult you directly into a glittering lunar landscape where these friendly monsters will do their best to give you some sparkling souvenirs to bring back to Earth every time you play Gem Rocks slot machine. In essence, the online Gem Rocks slot has a Tetris-like atmosphere, with an assortment of brightly colored gems falling when touched and falling from the bottom of the screen during winning tailhooks; the net result can be win after win during hot Gem Rocks mobile slot sessions. This makes the Gem Rocks slot machine inherently satisfying.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nVisually, Gem Rocks looks stunning - like all Yggdrasil Gaming slots to be honest. Embedded in a world of rocks and gems, it's characterized by kind-hearted giants with gemstone hearts! Set on a rocky and mountainous terrain, this fast-paced game is exciting and has an epic feel. The symbols on the rules include 8 regular stones/gems - the most rewarding being the star that gives you 75 coins for 5 in a cluster.\nWhen you get a winning combination, the Cascade Wins feature is activated - the contributing symbols disappear from the screen, leaving space for new symbols. The new symbols keep coming until you get winning combinations.\nThe main attraction of the slot is the Gem Rock feature - which is activated when you get 2, 5 and 9 consecutive cascade wins. You can track your progress with the gem meter on the screen. Once activated, a single Gem Rock lands on top of the reels - this is built with identical symbols. The more times you win consecutively, the bigger the Gem Rock:\n2 consecutive wins = 2x2 Gem Rock\n5 consecutive wins = 3x3 Gem Rock\n9 consecutive wins = 4x4 Gem Rock\nSubstantially explained, Gem Rocks Gem falls that show the same symbol - this allows you to easily form winning combinations more easily. The key is to get 9 or more consecutive wins to get the big 4x4 Gem Rock that can lead to big wins. If you get a 4x4 Gem Rock composed of the high-value star stone/gem, this can lead to big wins. As far as variety is concerned, it is from medium to high, with a maximum win of 2,500 times your bet on each spin.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you like Gem Rocks, I recommend trying some of Yggdrasil Gaming's other superb slots like Valley of the Gods and Vikings Go Berzerk 2. In the first case, you will find yourself playing and betting your money in the legendary world of Ancient Egypt and you can win up to €580,000 with a single bet.\n            ",

Based on a race of characters made of rocks in a world of stones and gems, it offers cascading wins, up to 4×4 cluster symbols and win-all-ways payout.\nA rocky graphic\nThe terrain shifts and the mountains move when this tremendous tribe of kind-hearted giants decides it's time to accumulate some wins in our February version of Gem Rocks! The real beauty of this rough diamond lies in how the combination of cascading wins, cluster symbols and win-all-ways gives you the chance to finish every round with a monstrous win. Add to this the fact that consecutive wins add up to a cluster of up to 4×4 symbols with a guaranteed win on the reels, and you will know that you have a true gem in your hands!\nThe man who set foot on the moon caused quite a stir in 1969, but no one thought to tell us about the race of gems giants that inhabit there. Fortunately, Gem Rocks slots catapult you directly into a glittering lunar landscape where these friendly monsters will do their best to give you some sparkling souvenirs to bring back to Earth every time you play Gem Rocks slot machine. In essence, the online Gem Rocks slot has a Tetris-like atmosphere, with an assortment of brightly colored gems falling when touched and falling from the bottom of the screen during winning tailhooks; the net result can be win after win during hot Gem Rocks mobile slot sessions. This makes the Gem Rocks slot machine inherently satisfying.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nVisually, Gem Rocks looks stunning - like all Yggdrasil Gaming slots to be honest. Embedded in a world of rocks and gems, it's characterized by kind-hearted giants with gemstone hearts! Set on a rocky and mountainous terrain, this fast-paced game is exciting and has an epic feel. The symbols on the rules include 8 regular stones/gems - the most rewarding being the star that gives you 75 coins for 5 in a cluster.\nWhen you get a winning combination, the Cascade Wins feature is activated - the contributing symbols disappear from the screen, leaving space for new symbols. The new symbols keep coming until you get winning combinations.\nThe main attraction of the slot is the Gem Rock feature - which is activated when you get 2, 5 and 9 consecutive cascade wins. You can track your progress with the gem meter on the screen. Once activated, a single Gem Rock lands on top of the reels - this is built with identical symbols. The more times you win consecutively, the bigger the Gem Rock:\n2 consecutive wins = 2x2 Gem Rock\n5 consecutive wins = 3x3 Gem Rock\n9 consecutive wins = 4x4 Gem Rock\nSubstantially explained, Gem Rocks Gem falls that show the same symbol - this allows you to easily form winning combinations more easily. The key is to get 9 or more consecutive wins to get the big 4x4 Gem Rock that can lead to big wins. If you get a 4x4 Gem Rock composed of the high-value star stone/gem, this can lead to big wins. As far as variety is concerned, it is from medium to high, with a maximum win of 2,500 times your bet on each spin.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nIf you like Gem Rocks, I recommend trying some of Yggdrasil Gaming's other superb slots like Valley of the Gods and Vikings Go Berzerk 2. In the first case, you will find yourself playing and betting your money in the legendary world of Ancient Egypt and you can win up to €580,000 with a single bet.\n            ",
