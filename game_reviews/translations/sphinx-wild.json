            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Sphinx Wild\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nSphinx Wild\nThe Sphinx Wild slot game is a version of the famous Sphinx slot, with a game that focuses more on the wild symbol. On this page, we will discover all its features, highlighting the fact that you can play it for free without registering. Get ready to enter the pyramids of ancient Egypt, with none other than your adventurous spirit by your side. Produced by IGT, this slot features 40 paylines in a special display format of 4x5. In addition to the game's wild symbols, the Sphinx Wild slot also features scatter symbols, expanding symbols, and free bonus spins.\n\nSlot machine graphics\nJust like in the classic version, the graphics of the Sphinx slot adhere to a minimal style. Unlike the classic version, the bonus element of entering the pyramids, which had a fascinating design, is missing in the Sphinx Wild slot. In the Sphinx Wild slot, the game takes place entirely on the initial screen, on the reels, without entering any other virtual environments. The slot symbols, just like in the classic version, include the pharaoh's sarcophagus (which represents the game's wild), pyramids (scatter symbol), fans, sacred objects including amulets, jewelry, and the eye of Ra.\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the Sphinx Wild slot\nSpecial features are activated with special symbols:\n\nWild (Pharaoh's sarcophagus): appears on two squares and can expand to all surrounding reels if the expansion results in a win.\nScatter (pyramids): pays in any position they appear and can pay up to 25x the total bet (5 pyramids that appear in the same spin, even in different positions, not necessarily on paylines).\n\nWe put the focus on the Wild symbol, which is the true protagonist of the game. In fact, as we specified in the first point, if the expansion results in a win, you can get numerous wild squares in the same spin for very high winnings. Among the special features, in addition to the expanding wild, we have the free bonus spins. By viewing three or more pyramid symbols in any position on the reels, in addition to winning a prize for the combination of scattered symbols, you can also access the free spin bonus game, where you can win up to 60 free spins (with a x1 multiplier) or 14 free spins (with a x5 multiplier).\n\nSphinx Wild slot evaluation\nAlthough the graphics are not amazing, the high prizes that can be won with expanding wilds make you forget about everything else. Therefore, it is certainly an interesting slot, created by the same supplier as the Sphinx, one of the most successful slots in recent years. The Sphinx Wild slot's Return to Player (RTP) percentage is around 96%, which makes it undoubtedly interesting from a payout perspective.\n\nSphinx Slot FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions\nWhere can I play the Sphinx Wild slot for free?\nYou can play the Sphinx Wild slot for free on SlotJava, as well as on hundreds of other slots, all without registering and without downloading any software.\n\nHow do you win?\nThe winnings are based on combinations of identical symbols that can be obtained each round.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nSphinx Wild online slot game\nFeatures of Sphinx Wild slot game\nPaylines and display format\nSymbols in the game\nBonus features\nRTP percentage\nComparison to similar slot games\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Sphinx Wild\nThe Sphinx Wild slot game is a version of the famous Sphinx slot, with a game that focuses more on the wild symbol. On this page, we will discover all its features, highlighting the fact that you can play it for free without registering. Get ready to enter the pyramids of ancient Egypt, with none other than your adventurous spirit by your side. Produced by IGT, this slot features 40 paylines in a special display format of 4x5. In addition to the game's wild symbols, the Sphinx Wild slot also features scatter symbols, expanding symbols, and free bonus spins.\n\nSlot machine graphics\nJust like in the classic version, the graphics of the Sphinx slot adhere to a minimal style. Unlike the classic version, the bonus element of entering the pyramids, which had a fascinating design, is missing in the Sphinx Wild slot. In the Sphinx Wild slot, the game takes place entirely on the initial screen, on the reels, without entering any other virtual environments. The slot symbols, just like in the classic version, include the pharaoh's sarcophagus (which represents the game's wild), pyramids (scatter symbol), fans, sacred objects including amulets, jewelry, and the eye of Ra.\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the Sphinx Wild slot\nSpecial features are activated with special symbols:\n\nWild (Pharaoh's sarcophagus): appears on two squares and can expand to all surrounding reels if the expansion results in a win.\nScatter (pyramids): pays in any position they appear and can pay up to 25x the total bet (5 pyramids that appear in the same spin, even in different positions, not necessarily on paylines).\n\nWe put the focus on the Wild symbol, which is the true protagonist of the game. In fact, as we specified in the first point, if the expansion results in a win, you can get numerous wild squares in the same spin for very high winnings. Among the special features, in addition to the expanding wild, we have the free bonus spins. By viewing three or more pyramid symbols in any position on the reels, in addition to winning a prize for the combination of scattered symbols, you can also access the free spin bonus game, where you can win up to 60 free spins (with a x1 multiplier) or 14 free spins (with a x5 multiplier).\n\nSphinx Wild slot evaluation\nAlthough the graphics are not amazing, the high prizes that can be won with expanding wilds make you forget about everything else. Therefore, it is certainly an interesting slot, created by the same supplier as the Sphinx, one of the most successful slots in recent years. The Sphinx Wild slot's Return to Player (RTP) percentage is around 96%, which makes it undoubtedly interesting from a payout perspective.\n\nSphinx Slot FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions\nWhere can I play the Sphinx Wild slot for free?\nYou can play the Sphinx Wild slot for free on SlotJava, as well as on hundreds of other slots, all without registering and without downloading any software.\n\nHow do you win?\nThe winnings are based on combinations of identical symbols that can be obtained each round.

On this page, we will discover all its features, highlighting the fact that you can play it for free without registering. Get ready to enter the pyramids of ancient Egypt, with none other than your adventurous spirit by your side. Produced by IGT, this slot features 40 paylines in a special display format of 4x5. In addition to the game's wild symbols, the Sphinx Wild slot also features scatter symbols, expanding symbols, and free bonus spins.\n\nSlot machine graphics\nJust like in the classic version, the graphics of the Sphinx slot adhere to a minimal style. Unlike the classic version, the bonus element of entering the pyramids, which had a fascinating design, is missing in the Sphinx Wild slot. In the Sphinx Wild slot, the game takes place entirely on the initial screen, on the reels, without entering any other virtual environments. The slot symbols, just like in the classic version, include the pharaoh's sarcophagus (which represents the game's wild), pyramids (scatter symbol), fans, sacred objects including amulets, jewelry, and the eye of Ra.\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the Sphinx Wild slot\nSpecial features are activated with special symbols:\n\nWild (Pharaoh's sarcophagus): appears on two squares and can expand to all surrounding reels if the expansion results in a win.\nScatter (pyramids): pays in any position they appear and can pay up to 25x the total bet (5 pyramids that appear in the same spin, even in different positions, not necessarily on paylines).\n\nWe put the focus on the Wild symbol, which is the true protagonist of the game. In fact, as we specified in the first point, if the expansion results in a win, you can get numerous wild squares in the same spin for very high winnings. Among the special features, in addition to the expanding wild, we have the free bonus spins. By viewing three or more pyramid symbols in any position on the reels, in addition to winning a prize for the combination of scattered symbols, you can also access the free spin bonus game, where you can win up to 60 free spins (with a x1 multiplier) or 14 free spins (with a x5 multiplier).\n\nSphinx Wild slot evaluation\nAlthough the graphics are not amazing, the high prizes that can be won with expanding wilds make you forget about everything else. Therefore, it is certainly an interesting slot, created by the same supplier as the Sphinx, one of the most successful slots in recent years. The Sphinx Wild slot's Return to Player (RTP) percentage is around 96%, which makes it undoubtedly interesting from a payout perspective.\n\nSphinx Slot FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions\nWhere can I play the Sphinx Wild slot for free?\nYou can play the Sphinx Wild slot for free on SlotJava, as well as on hundreds of other slots, all without registering and without downloading any software.\n\nHow do you win?\nThe winnings are based on combinations of identical symbols that can be obtained each round.

On this page, we will discover all its features, highlighting the fact that you can play it for free without registering. Get ready to enter the pyramids of ancient Egypt, with none other than your adventurous spirit by your side. Produced by IGT, this slot features 40 paylines in a special display format of 4x5. In addition to the game's wild symbols, the Sphinx Wild slot also features scatter symbols, expanding symbols, and free bonus spins.\n\nSlot machine graphics\nJust like in the classic version, the graphics of the Sphinx slot adhere to a minimal style. Unlike the classic version, the bonus element of entering the pyramids, which had a fascinating design, is missing in the Sphinx Wild slot. In the Sphinx Wild slot, the game takes place entirely on the initial screen, on the reels, without entering any other virtual environments. The slot symbols, just like in the classic version, include the pharaoh's sarcophagus (which represents the game's wild), pyramids (scatter symbol), fans, sacred objects including amulets, jewelry, and the eye of Ra.\n\nFunctions and bonuses of the Sphinx Wild slot\nSpecial features are activated with special symbols:\n\nWild (Pharaoh's sarcophagus): appears on two squares and can expand to all surrounding reels if the expansion results in a win.\nScatter (pyramids): pays in any position they appear and can pay up to 25x the total bet (5 pyramids that appear in the same spin, even in different positions, not necessarily on paylines).\n\nWe put the focus on the Wild symbol, which is the true protagonist of the game. In fact, as we specified in the first point, if the expansion results in a win, you can get numerous wild squares in the same spin for very high winnings. Among the special features, in addition to the expanding wild, we have the free bonus spins. By viewing three or more pyramid symbols in any position on the reels, in addition to winning a prize for the combination of scattered symbols, you can also access the free spin bonus game, where you can win up to 60 free spins (with a x1 multiplier) or 14 free spins (with a x5 multiplier).\n\nSphinx Wild slot evaluation\nAlthough the graphics are not amazing, the high prizes that can be won with expanding wilds make you forget about everything else. Therefore, it is certainly an interesting slot, created by the same supplier as the Sphinx, one of the most successful slots in recent years. The Sphinx Wild slot's Return to Player (RTP) percentage is around 96%, which makes it undoubtedly interesting from a payout perspective.\n\nSphinx Slot FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions\nWhere can I play the Sphinx Wild slot for free?\nYou can play the Sphinx Wild slot for free on SlotJava, as well as on hundreds of other slots, all without registering and without downloading any software.\n\nHow do you win?\nThe winnings are based on combinations of identical symbols that can be obtained each round.
