It features a streak respin feature and a free spin that is embellished with multipliers, mystery symbol types that will only reveal themselves during the game, and sticky symbols.

Autoplay mode and changing bets are available with the click of a button.\n\nDesign and graphics\n\nThe sound and graphics of Drago: Jewels of Fortune are superb. The image is crisp, high quality, and rich in detail. The Dragons' den and treasure-filled chests in the background set the mood. Symbols from A to 10 in dragon skin style and a quartet of higher paying dragons are present. The game interface is simple and intuitive. Access to the payout table, which is given in cash rather than coins, is easy. The design carries well over to mobile with high definition imaging.\n\nSlot machine functions\n\nThe Drago: Jewel of Fortune Slot has a wide range of bets starting at a minimum of 20 cents and ending with a maximum of 100.00 euros per spin.
