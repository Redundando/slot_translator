Questa serie di casse si muove verso sinistra a ogni giocata ed è possibile riscattare il premio all’interno trovando il simbolo Scatter speciale (un pianeta d’oro con due anelli tipo Saturno).

Developed by High 5 Games, this game stands out from the crowd with its breathtaking visual and musical design, as well as its exciting gameplay. The absence of a grid adds to the charm of the game, as symbols are scattered around a stunning space-themed background that shifts from purple to blue. Cosmic Heart offers a relaxing gaming experience that is perfect for unwinding after a long day at work.\n\nBut it's not just about the aesthetics - Cosmic Heart's technical aspects are just as impressive. With a 5x4 grid and an RTP of 96%, the game offers a high volatility that promises frequent, but potentially high payouts. One of the unique features is the set of glowing boxes above each reel. These boxes move to the left after every spin, and to receive the prize inside, players must find the special Scatter symbol - a golden planet with rings like Saturn. Finding this symbol can trigger a variety of bonuses, including Wilds that cover the entire reel, horizontally expanding Wilds, multipliers, and free spins. \n\nOverall, Cosmic Heart is a slot game that has it all - stunning design, exciting gameplay, and substantial payouts. For those looking for similar games in the space-themed genre, Wazdan's Space Spins and Space Gem, as well as NetEnt's Space Wars, are other titles worth exploring. So if you're an experienced gambler looking for something out-of-this-world, why not give Cosmic Heart a spin?",

In fact, you might go as many spins as you do days without taking a shower before you hit a big payout. The good news is that Cosmic Heart has a healthy 96% RTP, which means you're going to score a payout eventually, albeit after a few prayers, some lucky underwear and perhaps a bottle or two of holy water.</p><p>And when that big payout finally hits, it's going to be bigger than Joe Exotic's ego. Cosmic Heart knows how to reward its players. Each spin offers the potential for a massive payout, and let's face it, who doesn't like massive payouts? I mean, if you're going to dream, dream big, right? Cosmic Heart does just that, and it's one of the reasons why this slot game is quickly becoming a fan favourite among players. So, gear up, put on your cosmic boots and spin those reels. Who knows, you might be the next lucky person to hit that cosmic payout.</p>\"\n}"

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a length of 15 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics\n\nCosmic Heart features a standard 5x4 grid, with twenty symbols appearing on the screen per spin. With an RTP of 96% and high volatility, expect several non-winning spins before hitting a big payout. Each spin offers the potential for a massive payout, adding excitement to an already exhilarating slot that invites players to explore the universe with every spin.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nTo increase the chances of winning big, players should focus on unlocking the special feature located at the top of the game screen. Each reel features a glowing prize box, and as players spin, the boxes move towards the left side of the screen. Landing on the special scatter symbol activates the Bonus Round on the corresponding reel. The Bonus Round could be a Wild symbol covering the entire reel or expanding horizontally, increasing the payout multiplier or awarding free spins.\n\nVisual and Musical Aspects\n\nUnlike most slots, Cosmic Heart does not have visible reels to spin. Instead, players will watch different space-themed minerals and planets float around in open space on a backdrop that fades from blue to purple. The background music is calming, and the sounds of spinning reels and winning paylines are muted, providing the perfect setting to unwind after a long day of gambling.\n\nSimilar Slot Games\n\nSeveral other games use space as a theme, such as \"Space Spins\" and \"Space Gem\" by Wazdan and \"Space Wars\" by NetEnt, to name a few.\n\nRTP and Volatility\n\nCosmic Heart has an RTP of 96% and high volatility, expect several non-winning spins before hitting a big payout. However, each spin offers the potential for a massive payout, adding excitement to an already exhilarating slot that invites players to explore the universe with every spin.\n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay Mechanics\n\nThe standard 5x4 grid offers twenty symbols to appear on the screen each spin. Players can land on different space-themed minerals and planets to achieve a payout. With an RTP of 96% and high volatility, players should expect several unsuccessful spins before hitting a big payout. The special feature, located at the top of the game screen, increases the chances of a massive payout.\n\nVisual Aspect\n\nUnlike most slots, there are no visible reels in Cosmic Heart. The backdrop, which fades from blue to purple, sets the stage for a calm and serene gaming experience. The space-themed minerals and planets float around in an open space, adding a space-like feel to the game.\n\nMusical Aspect\n\nCosmic Heart's background music is calming and respectful of the setting of the game. The sound effects of spinning reels and winning paylines are muted, creating the perfect environment to unwind and relax.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nThe special feature in Cosmic Heart is located at the top of the game screen, where each reel features a glowing prize box. If players land on the special scatter symbol, they activate the Bonus Round on the corresponding reel, which could be a Wild symbol covering the whole reel, expanding horizontally, increasing the payout multiplier, or awarding free spins.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nSome other space-themed slot games include Space Spins and Space Gem by Wazdan and Space Wars by NetEnt. Although these games share a similar theme, they differ in their gameplay mechanics and unique features.\n\n        \n            ",

However, High 5 Games has transcended beyond our planet by presenting us with the mesmerizing \"Cosmic Heart\" slot, set in the wonders of the universe.\n\nThrough this review, we will delve into the visual and musical aspects as well as the technical gameplay mechanics of this space-themed slot. Sit back, and let's explore the \"Cosmic Heart.\"\n\n\"Cosmic Heart\" - No One Can Hear You Play In Space\nWhile \"Cosmic Heart\" is not the only space-themed slot available online, it is, without a doubt, one of the most soothing and interesting to play, even from a gambler's perspective.\n\nUnlike most slots, \"Cosmic Heart\" does not have visible reels to spin. Instead, players will watch different space-themed minerals and planets float around in open space on a backdrop that fades from blue to purple. The background music is calming, and the sounds of spinning reels and winning paylines are muted, providing the perfect setting to unwind after a long day of gambling.\n\n\"Cosmic Heart\" - Gameplay Mechanics\nNow, let's move on the technical side of this slot. \"Cosmic Heart\" features a standard 5x4 grid, with twenty symbols appearing on the screen per spin. With an RTP of 96% and high volatility, expect several non-winning spins before hitting a big payout.\n\nTo increase the chances of winning big, players should focus on unlocking the special feature located at the top of the game screen. Each reel features a glowing prize box, and as players spin, the boxes move towards the left side of the screen. Landing on the special scatter symbol, an image of a golden planet with Saturn-like rings, activates the Bonus Round on the corresponding reel.\n\nThe Bonus Round could be a Wild symbol covering the entire reel or expanding horizontally, increasing the payout multiplier or awarding free spins.\n\nEach spin offers the potential for a massive payout, adding excitement to an already exhilarating slot that invites players to explore the universe with every spin.\n\nOther slots like \"Cosmic Heart\"\nAs we mentioned earlier, several other games use space as a theme, such as \"Space Spins\" and \"Space Gem\" by Wazdan and \"Space Wars\" by NetEnt, just to name a few.\n        ",
