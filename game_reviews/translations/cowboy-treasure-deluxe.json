It is a five-reel, three-row slot game that offers 15 symbols per spin. The gameplay includes a wild symbol and a bonus mode, which makes it possible to obtain higher value combinations. The game also offers three different jackpots - Tasty, Luxury, and Dream Chance, which offer different winnings and make the game more interesting.\n\nGame Symbols and Design\n\nThe game grid in Cowboy Treasure Deluxe is located in the middle of reddish rock formations that resemble the Grand Canyon. The symbols in the game are well-crafted, and their details are reminiscent of the old Wild West. Symbols include the traditional playing cards with western design, an outlaw and a sheriff, a black rearing horse, a whiskey bottle, an old locomotive, and a treasure chest full of money. The background music contributes to the western feel of the game, making the overall design a compelling aspect of Cowboy Treasure Deluxe.\n\nWild Symbol and Bonus Mode\n\nThe sheriff's star is the wild symbol in Cowboy Treasure Deluxe. It replaces all the other normal symbols and functions as a wild card in a card game. The bonus mode is activated by finding at least three symbols, welcoming players to new features that increase your chances of winning.\n\nJackpots Available\n\nCowboy Treasure Deluxe offers three different jackpots. The Tasty jackpot is the easiest to win but offers the lowest payout, while the Dream Chance jackpot is the most challenging to win but offers the highest payout. The Luxury jackpot falls between the Tasty and Dream Chance jackpots concerning obtainability and payout. These jackpots make the game more interesting and increase the adrenaline rush while playing Cowboy Treasure Deluxe.\n\nOther Slots in this Theme\n\nThe Wild West theme has become increasingly popular in the world of online slot games. Other notable slots in this category include Gunslinger, The True Sheriff, and Wild Wild West: The Great Train Heist. Each of these games shares the Wild West theme, but they all offer a distinctive player experience.\n\n        \n            ",

The Wild West was a real \"no man's land\", still to be explored, where you could find gold like on the famous Oregon Trail, or isolated towns in the desert where justice and wickedness coexisted not very peacefully.\n\nThese ideals of dangerous freedom and spirit of adventure are now gone, but you can relive them thanks to Play N' Go's Cowboy Treasure Deluxe slot.\n\nLet's talk about it in more detail with a review, starting with its graphics.\n\nCowboy Treasure Deluxe - Graphics\n\nOne of the iconic scenarios of the Wild West is definitely the canyon. In fact, the game grid of Cowboy Treasure Deluxe is located in the middle of reddish rock formations that strongly resemble the famous Grand Canyon.\n\nThe real star is the grid, which, with details reminiscent of old wooden signs, occupies almost the entire screen of the slot to make us admire the symbols. Many online slots have symbols related to playing cards, thus representing a classic already established. But while many prefer to use simple initials, Cowboy Treasure Deluxe makes them even more interesting by associating the symbol of the corresponding card with jacks, queens and kings in a western key.\n\nIn addition to this feature, we also find symbols related to the setting itself, such as a shady outlaw and a sheriff with a golden star on his chest, or a black rearing horse, a whiskey bottle, an old locomotive, and a treasure chest full of money. The background music is also perfect for the setting, as it sounds like the soundtrack of an old western movie.\n\nCowboy Treasure Deluxe is visually interesting with many well-crafted details, but what about the gameplay? Let's see it in the next point!\n\nCowboy Treasure Deluxe - How to Play\n\nLet's now talk about the technical aspect of this slot: the game grid mechanism is very similar to the common one found in most online slots. Therefore, it has five reels and three horizontal lines, whose intersection shows a total of fifteen symbols per spin.\n\nAmong the various symbols that interest us particularly, we find the Wild symbol (represented by the sheriff's star) that can replace all the other normal symbols in the game as if it were a wild card in a card game.\n\nThe other symbol is definitely the one that gives access to the Bonus mode: by finding at least three of them, we will access this function in which it will be possible to obtain higher value combinations.\n\nFinally, the slot offers three different jackpots, Tasty, Luxury and Dream Chance, which offer respectively higher and more difficult to obtain winnings, but which make the game more interesting.\n\nIn addition, the slot allows you to increase the value of the token even on a single one of the five winning lines, according to the player's style.\n\nSlots similar to Cowboy Treasure Deluxe\n\nThe world of the Wild West has become increasingly popular in the diverse world of online slots. Other notable slots in this theme are: Gunslinger, The True Sheriff, Wild Wild West: The Great Train Heist.\n        ",
