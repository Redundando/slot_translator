The setting is Sherwood Forest, with stunning graphics that look more like animation than a slot machine. The game has a grid with five reels and five rows, 25 paylines, and a Super Wild system that significantly enhances the chances of winning. The maximum potential payout is 4,000 times the stake amount. You can bet on Fire Archer with a minimum of 0.25 and a maximum of 125 credits, and you can play for free in demo mode before betting real money. The theoretical Return to Player (RTP) is a good 96.07%.\n\nSymbols and payouts in Fire Archer\n\nThe symbols on the reels in Fire Archer are partly thematic and partly not. The non-themed icons are playing cards from ten to Ace, which have the lowest value. For more substantial payouts, we need to hope that the thematic symbols appear instead: a mug full of beer, a hat, a sack full of coins, and, of course, Robin Hood himself! The maximum potential payout is 4,000 times the stake amount. Additionally, Fire Archer features a Scatter, the quiver, and a Wild, the target, which not only serves as a wildcard but also triggers a feature that turns it into a Super Wild!\n\nBonuses and features in Fire Archer\n\nFire Archer features two special symbols: a Scatter, the quiver, and a Wild, the target. The Scatter offers the possibility of obtaining five free spins, which can increase if more quivers appear during the free spins. The Wild not only serves as a wildcard but also triggers a feature that turns it into a Super Wild! Additionally, the game has a Super Wild system that significantly enhances the chances of winning.\n\nVolatility and payout potential of Fire Archer\n\nFire Archer is a highly volatile slot machine, meaning infrequent but substantial wins. While the maximum potential payout is 4,000 times the stake amount, it can be challenging to obtain.\n\nOverall experience and appeal of Fire Archer\n\nFire Archer is an exciting slot machine with beautiful graphics, innovative gameplay, and features. The fast-paced music makes the gaming experience enjoyable and engaging both for novice and experienced players. While the game is highly volatile, the substantial payout potential makes it appealing to players looking for big wins. The possibility of playing for free in demo mode before betting real money and the good theoretical RTP of 96.07% also add to the appeal of Fire Archer.\n\n        \n            ",

The theoretical Return to Player (RTP) is a good 96.07%.\nSymbols and special features\nIn Fire Archer, as in many other slot games, the symbols on the reels are partly thematic and partly not. In this case, non-themed icons are represented by playing cards from ten to Ace, also known as \"royals\", which have the lowest value. For more substantial payouts, we need to hope that the thematic symbols appear instead: a mug full of beer, a hat, a sack full of coins, and, of course, Robin Hood himself!\nAmong the special symbols in Fire Archer, there is a Scatter, the quiver, and a Wild, the target, which not only serves as a wildcard but also triggers a feature that turns it into a Super Wild! As per tradition, the Scatter offers the possibility of obtaining five free spins, which can increase if more quivers appear during the free spins.\n\nFAQ\nWhat special symbols are there in Fire Archer?\nWe have a Wild, which serves as a wildcard, and a Scatter, which triggers free spins.\n\nWhat is the theoretical Return to Player?\nThe RTP is a good 96.07%, on average.\n\nWhat is the volatility of Fire Archer?\nThis slot has a very high volatility, with substantial payouts but infrequent wins.\n            ",
