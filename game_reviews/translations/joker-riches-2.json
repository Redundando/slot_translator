Per fortuna c’erano i buffoni di corte ad allietare le ore serali dei regnanti, tra scherzi, prese in giro e spettacoli comici! E proprio sul Joker è incentrata questa slot prodotta dalla High 5 Games, con una grafica non particolarmente elaborata ma con un gameplay di sicuro interesse per la presenza di un gioco Bonus che promette di far vincere dei premi di tutto rispetto. Partiamo descrivendo l’ambientazione: sullo sfondo troviamo il castello arroccato su un rilievo, la griglia di gioco invece è incorniciata da due stendardi con quello di sinistra più largo in quanto destinato ad accogliere i simboli Wild che provvederemo a descrivere più avanti.

Dal tasto Autoplay è possibile impostare da 10 sino a 100 giri automatici e aggiungere dei limiti di perdita o di vincita oltre i quali la funzione automatica verrà fermata. La volatilità è alta e l’RTP si attesta su un ottimo 96%.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Jokers Riches 2\nI simboli base sono nove, suddivisi in base al valore dal più basso al più alto. All’ultimo gradino troviamo le carte da gioco J, K, Q, seguite dai tre Joker di colore verde, rosso e viola, tutti con lo stesso valore. Infine, troviamo il principe, la regina e il re che sono i simboli che assicurano le vincite più alte. Il simbolo Wild è rappresentato dal Joker con la scritta Wild sul colletto, ma per renderlo attivo è necessario che sia a sua volta attivata la funzione Lasting Activated Wilds: sul quinto rullo appaiono uno o più bastoni dello stesso colore dei Joker e andranno ad occupare uno, due o tre posti sulla coccarda alla sinistra della griglia di gioco. Nei tre giri successivi ogni volta che apparirà il simbolo del Joker dello stesso colore del bastone, questo diventerà il Jolly e sostituirà tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter.\nLo Scatter è il simbolo delle picche con la scritta Bonus.

The game offers a cavalier musical background with sounds of trumpets and choirs on significant wins, accompanied by gold coins.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nThe game has high volatility and an RTP of 96%, making it a profitable slot to consider playing.\n\nPaylines and symbol hierarchy\n\nThe game features nine basic symbols, divided into value from lowest to highest.

The Wild symbol is represented by the Joker with the word “Wild” on the collar and appears on the fifth reel. The Scatter symbol is the spades symbol with the Bonus inscription.\n\nWilds, Scatters, and Bonus features\n\nTo activate the Wild symbol, one must activate the Lasting Activated Wilds feature by landing Wilds on the fifth reel. It replaces all symbols except the Scatter symbol. The Scatter symbol is the spades symbol with the Bonus inscription, and if three appear, the grid relocates inside the castle, and players receive seven free spins during which all Jokers become Wild.\n\n        \n            ",

Finally, we find the prince, the queen, and the king, which are the symbols that ensure the highest winnings. The Wild symbol is represented by the Joker with the word Wild on the collar, but to activate it, the Lasting Activated Wilds feature must also be activated: on the fifth reel, one or more sticks of the same color as the Joker appear and will occupy one, two, or three places on the rosette to the left of the game grid. In the next three spins, each time the Joker symbol of the same color as the stick appears, it will become the Joker and replace all symbols except the Scatter.\n\nThe Scatter is the symbol of spades with the Bonus inscription.

Luckily, court jesters were there to entertain the rulers during their evening hours, with jokes, teasing, and comedic performances! And it is exactly on the Joker that this slot machine produced by High 5 Games is focused, with a not particularly elaborate graphics but a gameplay of sure interest thanks to the presence of a Bonus game that promises to win substantial prizes. Let's start by describing the setting: in the background, we find the castle perched on a hill, while the game grid is framed by two banners with the left one larger to accommodate the Wild symbols that we will describe later. In the lower part, the balance, winnings, and bet value are indicated, on the right we find the button for manual rotation of the reels and the one for Autoplay. The cavalier music is interspersed with the sound of trumpets and jubilant choirs following the most important wins, which also flood the screen with gold coins.\n\nMain features of the slot machine\n\nThe game grid has a very traditional structure with five reels and three rows, with the fifth reel framed in gold because this is where the Wild symbols will appear. The paylines are fixed, 20 to be exact, on which you can bet from a minimum of 1 credit per line up to a maximum of 1,000 credits. From the Autoplay button, it is possible to set from 10 to 100 automatic spins and add loss or win limits beyond which the automatic function will be stopped. The volatility is high and the RTP stands at an excellent 96%.\n\nSymbols and functionalities of Jokers Riches 2\n\nThere are nine basic symbols, divided in value from the lowest to the highest. At the bottom step, we find the playing cards J, K, Q, followed by the three Jokers in green, red, and purple, all of the same value. Finally, we find the prince, the queen, and the king, which are the symbols that ensure the highest winnings. The Wild symbol is represented by the Joker with the word Wild on the collar, but to activate it, the Lasting Activated Wilds feature must also be activated: on the fifth reel, one or more sticks of the same color as the Joker appear and will occupy one, two, or three places on the rosette to the left of the game grid. In the next three spins, each time the Joker symbol of the same color as the stick appears, it will become the Joker and replace all symbols except the Scatter.\n\nThe Scatter is the symbol of spades with the Bonus inscription. If three appear, the grid moves inside the castle and you are entitled to seven free spins during which all Jokers become automatically Wild.\n        ",
