Il meccanismo di pagamento è quello a cluster e, ovviamente, più grande è il raggruppamento di simboli, fino ad arrivare all’intera griglia 5×5 coperta dallo stesso simbolo, maggiore sarà l’entità della vincita.\nIl gioco in Miles Bellhouse and the Gears of Time si snoda tra spin regolari, giri gratuiti e tre round bonus ambientati rispettivamente nel passato, nel presente e nel futuro.\nLe opzioni di puntata sulle 30 linee di pagamento, variano da un minimo di 10 centesimi fino a un massimo di 5 € per ciascun giro e, sebbene si tratti di un range di scommessa abbastanza limitato, sfruttando le funzionalità speciali e i vari moltiplicatori, si possono ottenere delle vincite fino a 2.000 volte il valore della puntata. Se poi non volete spendere nulla e volete giocare solo per divertimento, potrete provare Miles Bellhouse and the Gears of Time in versione demo totalmente gratuita e senza necessità di registrazione.\nSimboli di Miles Bellhouse and the Gears of Time\nIn Miles Bellhouse and the Gears of Time non troviamo i reali ma solo dei simboli tematici che includono lo scienziato, il suo assistente robot, un orologio, degli occhiali e degli ingranaggi a rotella di diverso colore.\nIl simbolo Wild è una sorta di vortice che sostituisce tutti gli altri simboli, mentre gli Scatter sono tre, rappresentano presente, passato e futuro e, se compaiono sui rulli per almeno tre volte, permettono di accedere alle funzioni speciali corrispondenti, in cui potrete usufruire di Free Spins e ricchi moltiplicatori.\n",
