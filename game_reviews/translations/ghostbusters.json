And the Ghostbusters slot is definitely one of the best.\nDirectly from the first movie of a cult series that started in 1984 and features a quartet of \"ghostbusters\" dealing with supernatural and divine events, the Ghostbusters slot promises fun gameplay.\nIn the following review, we will not only analyze the purely technical parts of this slot, but also highlight its aesthetic component. Which in a slot inspired by Ghostbusters is undoubtedly a component not to be underestimated!\nGhostbusters - Graphics and music\nAs soon as we find ourselves in front of the slot, we will immediately be catapulted into the movie settings. Against the background of the firehouse, the headquarters of the ghostbusters, the game board is very simply presented with some metallic details and yellow and black stripes inspired by the movie.\nObviously, it is the symbols that are the most impactful part. In fact, instead of cherries or playing cards, we'll find the faces of the protagonists of the first movie: Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz, Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore, and even the clumsy accountant Louis Tully.\nAlong with them, there will be the iconic ECTO-1 car and also the famous objects invented by Egon for catching ghosts such as the PKE detector, the Ecto-Goggles, proton packs, and the ectoplasmic containment unit. Not forgetting the Ghostbusters logo, the mischievous green ghost Slimer representing the WILD symbol, and the Marshmallow Man during bonus gameplay.\nThe Ghostbusters slot is definitely well curated with regard to different references to the movie, details that all movie fans will appreciate and which the slot is more specifically targeted at. Also, from a sound point of view, we can hear the famous musical theme as background music.\nLet's move on to the technical features.\nGhostbusters - Let's play now\nThe gameplay proposed by this slot is rich and varied: on the one hand, we find a game board easy to master thanks to the presence of a pattern common to many online titles: five reels associated with three horizontal lines allow fifteen symbols to be seen in each gameplay.\nWe should not, however, think that this is a slot without novelty: Slimer is a Wild symbol that can replace all other normal symbols, and can also extend its function over the entire reel where it is located.\nIt is also possible to obtain Bonus symbols that behave like Scatters, assigning the special function if at least three are found in a single gameplay.\nThe goal of IGT is to create a fun and dynamic game even before obtaining the bonus mode so that the player can enjoy the title from start to finish, strengthened by a theme that they love so much.\nSlots similar to Ghostbusters\nMovies have always been one of the major sources of inspiration for online slot developers. From Playtech's Man of Steel (which boasts a decent number of titles on this list, such as King Kong and Gladiator Jackpot) to NetEnt's Planet of the Apes, and even the irreverent Ted of Blueprint Gaming.\n            ",
