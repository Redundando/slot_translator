From multicolored scarabs to cats, from Anubis to canopic jars, players will feel like they've been transported back in time to the land of the pyramids.\n\nBonus features\n\nEgyptian Riches offers two bonus features, making gameplay more exciting. The pharaoh's wife acts as the Scatter symbol, allowing players to access the bonus function. Finding at least three Scatter symbols in a single round will trigger the bonus mode. In addition, the title of the slot serves as the Wild symbol, which replaces all other normal symbols to help create winning combinations.\n\nPaylines\n\nEgyptian Riches is a five-reel slot with three symbols on each spin, making for a total of 15 images per turn. The game has 20 paylines, and winnings are based on symbol combinations.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics in Egyptian Riches effectively capture the essence of ancient Egypt. The color scheme features shades of yellow and light blue, which are common in paintings that depict this region. The background of the slot shows columns and drapes overlooking the Egyptian desert. The thematic symbols on the game grid further enhance the overall visual experience.\n\nSimilar titles\n\nEgyptian Riches is just one among many slots with an ancient Egyptian theme.

The game presents symbols related to the Egyptian world, and the same can be said for the more special ones, linked to bonus functions. In this case, there are two: the pharaoh's wife (whom we will not call pharaoh to avoid confusion with the bird) which is a Scatter symbol that allows us to access the bonus function and the title of the slot itself which instead covers the role of Wild, that is, a wild card capable of replacing all other normal symbols.\n\nGraphics and theme\n\nEgyptian Riches is thematically consistent, featuring symbols such as multicolored scarabs, cats, Anubis, and canopic jars that relate to Ancient Egypt. The colors used in the game are predominantly yellow and light blue, which are frequently used in paintings found in that region. The background of the slot is ambiguous, displaying columns or drapes overlooking the desert scenario of Ancient Egypt.\n\nSpecial features and bonuses\n\nEgyptian Riches features a bonus mode that is triggered by finding at least three scatter symbols of the pharaoh's wife in a single round. If four are found, the associated winnings will be multiplied by two, and if five are found, the maximum value, winnings are multiplied by four. The title of the slot has a unique role as a wild card capable of replacing all other normal symbols.\n\nWinning potential\n\nThe maximum payout for the game is 500x the initial bet, which is triggered by landing five wild symbols on a payline. Egyptian Riches does not offer a progressive jackpot or other significant jackpots outside of the aforementioned maximum payout.\n\nSimilar games\n\nMany slot games feature the theme of Ancient Egypt, such as Pragmatic Play's Ancient Egypt and Novomatic's Book of Ra. These are only two examples of the vast library of games with this common theme available. \n\n        \n            ",

The land and time of the pyramids, in fact, exercise a unique fascination in the imagination of anyone, thinking of the mysteries hidden in those monumental tombs and the treasures that are found there.\n\nIf we are talking about a fairly common theme, let's discover how WMS development house has exploited and adapted it with the title Egyptian Riches.\n\nEgyptian Riches: graphics and audio\n\nAs usual, let's start our analysis with the most \"superficial\" and immediate aspect that catches our attention: the visual aspect. The background of the slot is not clear, they could be columns as drapes that overlook the Egyptian desert scenario. The color that reigns supreme is definitely yellow and light blue, very common shades even in paintings that are still found in this country. The various symbols that make up the game grid are all themed.\n\nIn many slots, in fact, it is possible to find archetypes that clash with the proposed theme, such as that of playing card symbols (A, K, Q...) which in some cases, like this one, would not make sense. Fortunately, in Egyptian Riches we only find thematic symbols: from multicolored scarabs to cats, from Anubis to canopic jars.\n\nFinally, speaking of the sound aspect, the music and jingles related to winnings are only active during the actual game, so as not to tire the player during breaks.\n\nEgyptian Riches: game mechanics\n\nLet's quickly talk about the technical aspect of this slot: as is customary for WMS, we are faced with a title with five reels that show three symbols on each spin. Fifteen images per turn, therefore, which are arranged in combinations based on the 20 paylines.\n\nThe game presents, as we have said before, symbols related to the Egyptian world, and the same can be said for the more special ones, linked to bonus functions. In this case, there are two: the pharaoh's wife (whom we will not call pharaoh to avoid confusion with the bird) which is a Scatter symbol that allows us to access the bonus function and the title of the slot itself which instead covers the role of Wild, that is, a wild card capable of replacing all other normal symbols.\n\nSpeaking of the lady, it is possible to access the bonus mode by finding at least 3 of them in a single round. If we find four, the associated winnings will be multiplied by two. Finding five, the maximum value, winnings will be multiplied by four.\n\nSlots similar to Egyptian Riches\n\nAncient Egypt, as we said before, will always be a much-loved theme in the world of online slots. If we wanted to quickly navigate this huge catalog of titles, we could discover slots like Pragmatic Play's Ancient Egypt or Novomatic's Book of Ra, a legendary title in this theme that has been followed by other very similar chapters.\n\nBut these are just two examples of the many slots available to us.\n        ",
