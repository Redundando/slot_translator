In this game, the theme is Ancient Egypt, more specifically, the figure of Queen Cleopatra. We know that this is not an original theme, as Egyptian-themed slot machines have become as popular in recent years as fruit machines were decades ago.\n\nWhen it comes to the graphics of this Playson slot, we are not blown away: the background of both the initial and game screens is simply represented by the image of pyramids standing against a night sky. The only splash of color is from the figure of Cleopatra herself. The reels are depicted as if drawn on papyrus, but overall, there is nothing particularly noteworthy.\n\nMain Features of the Slot Machine\n\nThe Legend of Cleopatra Megaways slot machine uses the game system called \"Megaways,\" which implies a huge number of ways to win, ranging from 324 to an impressive 200,704. In terms of slot structure, it is a game with a grid consisting of 6 reels and a variable number of rows from 2 to 8.\n\nThe Megaways game system, under the concession of Big Time Gaming, who hold the rights to it, involves virtually unlimited combinations of ways to win, making every spin of the reels a unique event! The exact number of possible winning combinations is randomly determined at the beginning of a sequence of spins. Additionally, the game features an extra reel at the top of the screen, covering 4 positions and extending from reel 2 to 5. A small display located in the upper-right corner of the game window will show you at any time the number of active Megaways.\n\nThe theoretical return to player, or RTP of Legend of Cleopatra Megaways, is around 95.84%, which is on par with most slot games.\n\nSymbols and Features of Legend of Cleopatra Megaways\n\nThe symbols you can find on the reels of Legend of Cleopatra Megaways include, starting from those with the lowest value, playing cards from 9 to Ace, which award from 0.5 to 0.75 times the bet for combinations of six symbols.\n\nThe thematic icons, on the other hand, are of Egyptian theme: we have Anubis, Bastet, Horus, and Cleopatra herself. These symbols will allow you to win prizes of up to 40 times the value of your bet. A golden card marked with the corresponding letter is the Wild symbol, which acts as a joker.\n\nThere is no Scatter symbol, as the game uses another system for assigning free spins.",

Over the years, Playson has released a plethora of titles that have become cult favorites in the world of slot machines.\n\nThis particular game is set in ancient Egypt, with the focus on the queen Cleopatra. Admittedly, this isn't an original theme - Egyptian-themed slots have become as ubiquitous as fruit machines in recent years. However, Legend of Cleopatra Megaways makes up for this with its impressive gameplay.\n\nThe graphics of this Playson slot game aren't particularly mind-blowing. The background of both the initial screen and the gameplay screen simply show the image of pyramids against a nighttime sky, with the only pop of color provided by the figure of Cleopatra. The reels are depicted as if drawn on a papyrus scroll, but otherwise there's nothing else notable about their appearance.\n\nOne of the key features of this slot machine is the Megaways gameplay system, which gives players a potentially massive number of ways to win - anywhere from 324 to 200,704 possible combinations, to be exact. The game grid consists of six reels and two to eight rows.\n\nThe Megaways system, which is licensed by Big Time Gaming, allows for virtually endless combinations of ways to win. This means that every spin of the reels is a unique event! The exact number of potential winning combinations is determined randomly at the start of a spin sequence, and there's an extra reel at the top of the gameplay screen that covers four positions, extending from reel 2 to 5. A small display in the top right corner of the gameplay window shows the number of active Megaways at any given time.\n\nThe theoretical Return to Player (RTP) rate of Legend of Cleopatra Megaways is around 95.84%, which falls within the average range for most slot games.\n\nAs for the symbols and features of Legend of Cleopatra Megaways, the symbols on the reels are familiar to anyone who has played Egyptian-themed slots before. The low-value symbols are the playing cards from nine to Ace, which pay out 0.5 to 0.75 times the bet for combinations of six symbols.\n\nThe thematic symbols, on the other hand, depict Egyptian icons such as Anubi, Bastet, Horus, and of course, Cleopatra herself. These symbols can reward players with prizes of up to 40 times the bet value.\n\nThe Wild symbol is a golden card marked with the word \"Wild,\" which can serve as a wild card. Unlike many other slot games, there is no Scatter symbol - instead, the game uses a different system to trigger free spins.\n            ",

Players can potentially find themselves with combinations ranging from 324 to 200,704, determined randomly before each spin sequence. The grid itself is made up of six reels and up to eight rows, with an additional reel covering four positions from reel 2 to 5.\n\nTumbling Reels feature\n\nWhile there is no traditional cascading reels feature in Legend of Cleopatra Megaways, the game does offer Tumbling Reels. This means that after a winning combination is achieved, the symbols involved disappear, leaving gaps on the reels which are then replaced with new symbols that fall from above. If this results in a new winning combination, the process is repeated, potentially leading to multiple consecutive wins in a single spin.\n\nFree spins feature\n\nRather than using Scatter symbols to trigger free spins, Legend of Cleopatra Megaways uses a pyramid symbol. Players need to land at least four of these in order to activate the free spins feature, with the number of spins awarded increasing with the number of pyramids landed. During free spins, a multiplier is applied to any successive wins that occur thanks to the Tumbling Reels feature.\n\nNumber of ways to win\n\nWith its Megaways system, Legend of Cleopatra Megaways offers players a potentially massive number of ways to win. The exact number is determined randomly before each spin sequence, but can range from 324 to 200,704. This, combined with the Tumbling Reels feature and the possibility of multiplying wins during free spins, can make for an exciting and lucrative gameplay experience.\n\nGraphics and theme\n\nWhile the graphics of Legend of Cleopatra Megaways aren't particularly groundbreaking, they are fitting for the game's ancient Egyptian theme. The background showing the pyramids against a nighttime sky is atmospheric, and the reels themselves are depicted as if drawn on a papyrus scroll. The game's symbols, while familiar to fans of Egyptian-themed slots, are well-drawn and help to immerse players in the setting.\n\n        \n            ",

It provides players with an exceptionally large number of ways to win, ranging from 324 to 200,704 potential combinations. The game grid consists of six reels and two to eight rows, and there's an extra reel covering four positions.\n\nFree Spins Feature\n\nIn Legend of Cleopatra Megaways, rather than a Scatter symbol, players can trigger free spins by landing four of the gold coins with the word 'Bonus' across the top reel. Players initially receive 12 free spins, with additional spins awarded for every golden coin earned in the round. During free spins, there is a progressive multiplier bonus, which starts at 1x and increases by 1 every time the Tumbling Reels feature is activated.\n\nTumbling Reels Feature\n\nLike many other games with the Megaways system, Legend of Cleopatra Megaways also uses the Tumbling Reels feature. This feature causes the symbols in winning combinations to disappear, allowing new symbols to drop into place from above and potentially create even more wins. The Tumbling Reels feature continues until there are no more winning combinations.\n\nNumber of Ways to Win\n\nThe Megaways gameplay system provides an impressive number of ways to win, ranging from 324 to 200,704 potential combinations. This mechanic generates endless possibilities for each spin and keeps the game interesting. A small display in the top right corner of the gameplay screen shows the number of active Megaways at any given time.\n\nGraphic Design\n\nThe graphics of Legend of Cleopatra Megaways are not particularly outstanding. The game's background shows the image of pyramids against a nighttime sky, and the reels appear as if they were drawn on a papyrus scroll. The thematic symbols depict typical Egyptian icons such as Anubi, Bastet, Horus, and Cleopatra herself. The golden card marked with the word 'Wild' is the Wild symbol, which can serve as a substitute for any other symbol on the reels. Although the design is not exceptional, it does complement the overall Egyptian theme of the game.\n\n        \n            ",

Over the years, Playson has released a plethora of titles that have become cult favorites in the world of slot machines.\n\nThis particular game is set in ancient Egypt, with the focus on the queen Cleopatra. Admittedly, this isn't an original theme - Egyptian-themed slots have become as ubiquitous as fruit machines in recent years. However, Legend of Cleopatra Megaways makes up for this with its impressive gameplay.\n\nThe graphics of this Playson slot game aren't particularly mind-blowing. The background of both the initial screen and the gameplay screen simply show the image of pyramids against a nighttime sky, with the only pop of color provided by the figure of Cleopatra. The reels are depicted as if drawn on a papyrus scroll, but otherwise there's nothing else notable about their appearance.\n\nOne of the key features of this slot machine is the Megaways gameplay system, which gives players a potentially massive number of ways to win - anywhere from 324 to 200,704 possible combinations, to be exact. The game grid consists of six reels and two to eight rows.\n\nThe Megaways system, which is licensed by Big Time Gaming, allows for virtually endless combinations of ways to win. This means that every spin of the reels is a unique event! The exact number of potential winning combinations is determined randomly at the start of a spin sequence, and there's an extra reel at the top of the gameplay screen that covers four positions, extending from reel 2 to 5. A small display in the top right corner of the gameplay window shows the number of active Megaways at any given time.\n\nThe theoretical Return to Player (RTP) rate of Legend of Cleopatra Megaways is around 95.84%, which falls within the average range for most slot games.\n\nAs for the symbols and features of Legend of Cleopatra Megaways, the symbols on the reels are familiar to anyone who has played Egyptian-themed slots before. The low-value symbols are the playing cards from nine to Ace, which pay out 0.5 to 0.75 times the bet for combinations of six symbols.\n\nThe thematic symbols, on the other hand, depict Egyptian icons such as Anubi, Bastet, Horus, and of course, Cleopatra herself. These symbols can reward players with prizes of up to 40 times the bet value.\n\nThe Wild symbol is a golden card marked with the word \"Wild,\" which can serve as a wild card. Unlike many other slot games, there is no Scatter symbol - instead, the game uses a different system to trigger free spins.\n            ",
