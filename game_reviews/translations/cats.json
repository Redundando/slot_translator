Embark on a journey to different corners of the world and spin to win alongside some majestic big cats. The background behind the reels is filled with a wild sunset landscape, taking players on an adventure into the animal world. The game has a Free Spin round that is activated by landing paw print scatter symbols on reels two, three, and four.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe reel symbols in Cats are big and beautifully drawn big cats that make up the various combinations needed to win cash payouts. The playing card symbols make up the lower value ones in the game, while the higher value cat symbols are represented by various cats like jaguars, lions, tigers, leopards, and mountain lions. The game's wild symbol is the Cats slot game logo, which replaces all others except for the paw print scatter, while the split symbols look like regular cat symbols, but with two of them on it, offering the opportunity to get combinations of up to 10 symbols. \n\nFree Spin Round\n\nTo activate the Free Spin round, players must land five or six paw print scatter symbols on reels two, three, and four. Landing six paw print scatter symbols requires one of the symbols to be a Split Symbol. Landing five paw print scatters will trigger the bonus round with five free spins, while six scatters will trigger the same round but with 10 free spins. During the Free Spin round, no other free spins can be triggered, and the round will end when all free spins are exhausted or when the maximum prize limit is reached.\n\nSplit Symbols\n\nThe Split Symbols in Cats offers players the chance to get combinations of up to 10 symbols. Split Symbols look like regular cat symbols, but with two of them on it, and if the symbol has two cats on it, it means it's equivalent to landing two symbols. If players land five split symbols across an active payline, they will receive the equivalent of a grant of 10 symbols, significantly increasing payouts.\n\nSimilar Games\n\nTiger's Claw, a slot machine produced by Betsoft, is similar to Cats as it features a white tiger theme and takes players on a journey to Siberia. The RTP percentage is average, but what surprises players is the number of paylines, which reaches a whopping 720, increasing payouts for lucky players.\n\n        \n            ",

The game offers a ton of fun and action as players spin to win alongside some majestic big cats.\n\nGame Design and Graphics\n\nThe Cats slot game by IGT is a bold adventure into the animal world with spectacular background graphics and beautifully drawn big cats that make up the reel symbols. The background behind the reels is filled with a wild sunset landscape taking players to the African savannah where the world's largest cats live.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nThe Cats slot game logo is the wild symbol, which replaces all others except for the paw print scatter symbol to help create winning combinations.

The slot game Cats, created by IGT, features five reels, 30 paylines, and offers a ton of fun and action for the reels.\n\nAdmire the bright colors of the spectacular background and the beautifully drawn big cats that make up the reel symbols. Land high winning combinations of some of the fiercest and most beautiful animals on Earth.\n\nAn Animalistic Graphics\nThe Cats slot game by IGT is definitely a bold adventure into the animal world, and it hits players on many levels for its theme and design. The background behind the reels is filled with a wild sunset landscape. The reeds and trees will immediately take you to the African savannah, where some of the world's largest cats live.\n\nYou can delve into the heart of wild nature with the Cats slot game by IGT, landing on various themed symbol combinations to receive a winning cash payout.\n\nThe typical playing card symbols make up the lower value ones in the Cats slot game. Although they may not be on-theme or designed as such, they are available in bright colors, and we suppose they need to stand out when sharing the reels with such fantastic animal illustrations.\n\nThe higher value cat symbols are naturally represented by various cats. Players can land a jaguar, a lion, a tiger, a leopard, and even a mountain lion. The Cats slot game logo is the wild, which replaces all others except for the paw print scatter, to help create winning combinations.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe Cats Slot Game has a Free Spin that is activated by landing five or six paw print scatter symbols on reels two, three, and four. Landing six paw print scatter symbols requires at least one of the symbols to be a Split Symbol.\n\nLanding four paw print scatters won't trigger the free spin round, but it will multiply the total payout x2. This is a heavy bonus given to the player, and it counts a lot, especially if you're playing with a higher stake than the base one.\n\nLanding five paw print scatters will trigger the bonus round with five free spins, while six scatters will trigger the same round but with 10 free spins.\n\nDuring the free spin round, no other free spins can be triggered, and the round will end when all free spins are exhausted or when the maximum prize limit is reached. Of course, we hope that the players' luck is more inclined towards the latter outcome rather than the former.\n\nThe cat symbols pay more in the game, with the panther paying the most. Additionally, with the slot game Cats' special Split Symbols, you have the opportunity to get combinations of up to 10 symbols! Similarly, if you land 5 split symbols across an active payline, you will receive the equivalent of a grant of 10 symbols.\n\nSplit Symbols look like regular cat symbols, but with two of them on it. If the symbol has two cats on it, it means that it is the equivalent of landing two symbols.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nAfter all, they are felines. Therefore, we recommend Tiger's Claw, the Slot Machine produced by Betsoft, which will take you to the cold and desolate Siberia to experience a white tiger. The RTP percentage is average, but what really surprises is the number of paylines, which reaches a whopping 720!\n            ",

The slot game Cats, created by IGT, features five reels, 30 paylines, and offers a ton of fun and action for the reels.\n\nAdmire the bright colors of the spectacular background and the beautifully drawn big cats that make up the reel symbols. Land high winning combinations of some of the fiercest and most beautiful animals on Earth.\n\nAn Animalistic Graphics\nThe Cats slot game by IGT is definitely a bold adventure into the animal world, and it hits players on many levels for its theme and design. The background behind the reels is filled with a wild sunset landscape. The reeds and trees will immediately take you to the African savannah, where some of the world's largest cats live.\n\nYou can delve into the heart of wild nature with the Cats slot game by IGT, landing on various themed symbol combinations to receive a winning cash payout.\n\nThe typical playing card symbols make up the lower value ones in the Cats slot game. Although they may not be on-theme or designed as such, they are available in bright colors, and we suppose they need to stand out when sharing the reels with such fantastic animal illustrations.\n\nThe higher value cat symbols are naturally represented by various cats. Players can land a jaguar, a lion, a tiger, a leopard, and even a mountain lion. The Cats slot game logo is the wild, which replaces all others except for the paw print scatter, to help create winning combinations.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe Cats Slot Game has a Free Spin that is activated by landing five or six paw print scatter symbols on reels two, three, and four. Landing six paw print scatter symbols requires at least one of the symbols to be a Split Symbol.\n\nLanding four paw print scatters won't trigger the free spin round, but it will multiply the total payout x2. This is a heavy bonus given to the player, and it counts a lot, especially if you're playing with a higher stake than the base one.\n\nLanding five paw print scatters will trigger the bonus round with five free spins, while six scatters will trigger the same round but with 10 free spins.\n\nDuring the free spin round, no other free spins can be triggered, and the round will end when all free spins are exhausted or when the maximum prize limit is reached. Of course, we hope that the players' luck is more inclined towards the latter outcome rather than the former.\n\nThe cat symbols pay more in the game, with the panther paying the most. Additionally, with the slot game Cats' special Split Symbols, you have the opportunity to get combinations of up to 10 symbols! Similarly, if you land 5 split symbols across an active payline, you will receive the equivalent of a grant of 10 symbols.\n\nSplit Symbols look like regular cat symbols, but with two of them on it. If the symbol has two cats on it, it means that it is the equivalent of landing two symbols.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nAfter all, they are felines. Therefore, we recommend Tiger's Claw, the Slot Machine produced by Betsoft, which will take you to the cold and desolate Siberia to experience a white tiger. The RTP percentage is average, but what really surprises is the number of paylines, which reaches a whopping 720!\n            ",
