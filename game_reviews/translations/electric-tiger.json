            "response": "Electric Tiger is a slot game that immediately brings to mind a casino atmosphere. Produced by IGT, it features colors, sound effects, and a musical base that perfectly encapsulates the casino aesthetic. The graphics also include an entrancing background that may appeal to some players more than others.\n\nThis modern slot game, however, can also be enjoyed by old-school players, as it has few functions and symbols reminiscent of classic slot games. Electric Tiger boasts an RTP between 92.35% and 96.25%.\n\nGraphics of the Slot Machine\n\nIn Electric Tiger, a disco effect is created, with light effects illuminating the display and making it dynamic. Traditional symbols such as bells and varied fruit (including lemons and watermelons) appear alongside the tiger symbol, the true star of the game.\n\nWhenever tiger symbols appear, they cover the reel they appear on. For example, if a tiger stops on the fourth reel, it immediately becomes a \"tiger reel\" with three tigers in a row vertically.\n\nAnd the best part? The tiger symbol is also the wild symbol! This means that every time a tiger appears and gifts two additional tigers on the same reel, that entire reel becomes a wild reel.\n\nWhile this doesn't happen frequently, the tiger symbol can offer good rewards and help with winning combinations on all lines (as it covers the entire reel). A combination of five tigers pays out 3000 times the bet and can replace all symbols except the special symbols (stars).\n\nFunctions and Bonuses of the Slot\n\nThe special functions of Electric Tiger do not only include the expanding wild. There are other special symbols that activate additional features, such as the Star symbol, which activates the Gift Bonus round when it appears in any position on reel 3.\n\nThe Gift Bonus round randomly activates the Wheel Shot Bonus feature or the Wheel Bonus round, which begins and ends with the bonus feature that was activated.\n\nSo, what do these features do? Four fortune wheels and a bonus wheel are activated. The round starts with one initial spin on the first wheel. Each spin of the wheel is automatically activated and awards the displayed value, and it's possible to activate a spin of the wheel to the left or right of the current wheel.\n\nSimilar Slots to Electric Tiger\n\nPlaying Electric Tiger may remind players of other slot games that focused on either fortune wheels or tigers.

It features a casino aesthetic, with entrancing background graphics. The game is available for both old-school and new players as it has few functions and symbols reminiscent of classic and modern slot games. It boasts an RTP between 92.35% and 96.25%.\n\nTiger Symbol as a Wild and Its Benefits\n\nThe tiger symbol is the true star of Electric Tiger slot game. Whenever it appears, it covers the entire reel it appears on. This expands to a \"tiger reel,\" with three tigers in a row vertically. The tiger symbol is also a wild symbol, meaning that anytime it appears and gifts two additional tigers on the same reel, the reel immediately becomes a wild reel. The tiger symbol offers good rewards and helps with winning combinations on all lines.\n\nGift Bonus Round and Its Two Potential Rounds\n\nThe Gift Bonus round is triggered when the Star symbol appears in any position on the third reel. This round randomly activates the Wheel Shot Bonus feature or the Wheel Bonus round, which begins and ends with the activated feature. Four fortune wheels and a bonus wheel are activated. The round starts with one initial spin on the first wheel. Each spin of the wheel is automatically activated and awards the displayed value, and it's possible to activate a spin of the wheel to the left or right of the current wheel.\n\nPossible Rewards and Payouts\n\nA combination of five tiger symbols pays out 3000 times the bet and can replace all symbols except the special symbols (stars). The payout ranges in value from 5x to 150x the total bet based on the betting amount, while the maximum payout prize is 300,000 credits during the base game.\n\nSimilarities with Other IGT Slot Games\n\nElectric Tiger may remind players of other IGT slot games that focused on either fortune wheels or tigers. For instance, a passion for fortune wheels can try out IGT's Wheel of Fortune Ultra 5 Reels or Wheel of Fortune On Tour games. These games are entirely dedicated to the fortune wheel, and players can experience the same thrill as Electric Tiger.\n\n        \n            ",

It has a RTP between 92.35% and 96.25%. The game's tiger symbol is also the wild symbol, and it covers the entire reel to help create winning combinations. Whenever tiger symbols appear, they cover the reel they appear on, and sometimes gift two additional tigers on the same reel. The tiger symbol can offer good rewards, and a combination of five tigers pays out 3000 times the bet.\n\nDisco-themed design\n\nElectric Tiger creates a disco effect, with light effects illuminating the display and making it dynamic. Traditional symbols such as bells and varied fruit (including lemons and watermelons) appear alongside the tiger symbol, the true star of the game. The graphics also feature an entrancing background that may appeal to some players more than others.\n\nTiger symbol as wild and expanding wild\n\nThe tiger symbol in Electric Tiger is a wild symbol that covers the entire reel to help create winning combinations. Whenever tiger symbols appear, they cover the reel they appear on and sometimes gift two additional tigers on the same reel, creating an expanding wild reel. Every time a tiger appears and gifts two additional tigers on the same reel, that entire reel becomes a wild reel. A combination of five tigers pays out 3000 times the bet and can replace all symbols except the special symbols (stars).\n\nGift Bonus round\n\nThe Gift Bonus round in Electric Tiger is activated when a Star symbol appears in any position on reel 3. The gift bonus round randomly activates the Wheel Shot Bonus feature or the Wheel Bonus round, which begins and ends with the bonus feature that was activated. Four fortune wheels and a bonus wheel are activated. The round starts with one initial spin on the first wheel. Each spin of the wheel is automatically activated and awards the displayed value, and it's possible to activate a spin of the wheel to the left or right of the current wheel.\n\nSimilarity to other IGT games\n\nPlaying Electric Tiger may remind players of other slot games that focused on either fortune wheels or tigers.

Produced by IGT, it features colors, sound effects, and a musical base that perfectly encapsulates the casino aesthetic. The graphics also include an entrancing background that may appeal to some players more than others.\n\nThis modern slot game, however, can also be enjoyed by old-school players, as it has few functions and symbols reminiscent of classic slot games. Electric Tiger boasts an RTP between 92.35% and 96.25%.\n\nGraphics of the Slot Machine\n\nIn Electric Tiger, a disco effect is created, with light effects illuminating the display and making it dynamic. Traditional symbols such as bells and varied fruit (including lemons and watermelons) appear alongside the tiger symbol, the true star of the game.\n\nWhenever tiger symbols appear, they cover the reel they appear on. For example, if a tiger stops on the fourth reel, it immediately becomes a \"tiger reel\" with three tigers in a row vertically.\n\nAnd the best part? The tiger symbol is also the wild symbol! This means that every time a tiger appears and gifts two additional tigers on the same reel, that entire reel becomes a wild reel.\n\nWhile this doesn't happen frequently, the tiger symbol can offer good rewards and help with winning combinations on all lines (as it covers the entire reel). A combination of five tigers pays out 3000 times the bet and can replace all symbols except the special symbols (stars).\n\nFunctions and Bonuses of the Slot\n\nThe special functions of Electric Tiger do not only include the expanding wild. There are other special symbols that activate additional features, such as the Star symbol, which activates the Gift Bonus round when it appears in any position on reel 3.\n\nThe Gift Bonus round randomly activates the Wheel Shot Bonus feature or the Wheel Bonus round, which begins and ends with the bonus feature that was activated.\n\nSo, what do these features do? Four fortune wheels and a bonus wheel are activated. The round starts with one initial spin on the first wheel. Each spin of the wheel is automatically activated and awards the displayed value, and it's possible to activate a spin of the wheel to the left or right of the current wheel.\n\nSimilar Slots to Electric Tiger\n\nPlaying Electric Tiger may remind players of other slot games that focused on either fortune wheels or tigers. Those with a passion for fortune wheels can also try IGT's Wheel of Fortune Ultra 5 Reels, which is entirely dedicated to the fortune wheel.\n            ",

A combination of five tigers pays out 3000 times the bet and can replace all symbols except the special symbols (stars).\n\nFunctions and Bonuses of the Slot\n\nThe special functions of Electric Tiger do not only include the expanding wild. There are other special symbols that activate additional features, such as the Star symbol, which activates the Gift Bonus round when it appears in any position on reel 3.\n\nThe Gift Bonus round randomly activates the Wheel Shot Bonus feature or the Wheel Bonus round, which begins and ends with the bonus feature that was activated.\n\nSo, what do these features do? Four fortune wheels and a bonus wheel are activated. The round starts with one initial spin on the first wheel. Each spin of the wheel is automatically activated and awards the displayed value, and it's possible to activate a spin of the wheel to the left or right of the current wheel.\n\nSimilar Slots to Electric Tiger\n\nPlaying Electric Tiger may remind players of other slot games that focused on either fortune wheels or tigers. Those with a passion for fortune wheels can also try IGT's Wheel of Fortune Ultra 5 Reels, which is entirely dedicated to the fortune wheel.\n            ",

Produced by IGT, it features colors, sound effects, and a musical base that perfectly encapsulates the casino aesthetic. The graphics also include an entrancing background that may appeal to some players more than others.\n\nThis modern slot game, however, can also be enjoyed by old-school players, as it has few functions and symbols reminiscent of classic slot games. Electric Tiger boasts an RTP between 92.35% and 96.25%.\n\nGraphics of the Slot Machine\n\nIn Electric Tiger, a disco effect is created, with light effects illuminating the display and making it dynamic. Traditional symbols such as bells and varied fruit (including lemons and watermelons) appear alongside the tiger symbol, the true star of the game.\n\nWhenever tiger symbols appear, they cover the reel they appear on. For example, if a tiger stops on the fourth reel, it immediately becomes a \"tiger reel\" with three tigers in a row vertically.\n\nAnd the best part? The tiger symbol is also the wild symbol! This means that every time a tiger appears and gifts two additional tigers on the same reel, that entire reel becomes a wild reel.\n\nWhile this doesn't happen frequently, the tiger symbol can offer good rewards and help with winning combinations on all lines (as it covers the entire reel). A combination of five tigers pays out 3000 times the bet and can replace all symbols except the special symbols (stars).\n\nFunctions and Bonuses of the Slot\n\nThe special functions of Electric Tiger do not only include the expanding wild. There are other special symbols that activate additional features, such as the Star symbol, which activates the Gift Bonus round when it appears in any position on reel 3.\n\nThe Gift Bonus round randomly activates the Wheel Shot Bonus feature or the Wheel Bonus round, which begins and ends with the bonus feature that was activated.\n\nSo, what do these features do? Four fortune wheels and a bonus wheel are activated. The round starts with one initial spin on the first wheel. Each spin of the wheel is automatically activated and awards the displayed value, and it's possible to activate a spin of the wheel to the left or right of the current wheel.\n\nSimilar Slots to Electric Tiger\n\nPlaying Electric Tiger may remind players of other slot games that focused on either fortune wheels or tigers. Those with a passion for fortune wheels can also try IGT's Wheel of Fortune Ultra 5 Reels, which is entirely dedicated to the fortune wheel.\n        ",
