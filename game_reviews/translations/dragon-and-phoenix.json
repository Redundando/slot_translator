It tells the story of two legendary creatures of the country, the Asian-style Dragon and the Phoenix bird. The graphics are impressive as you can imagine, coming from Betsoft, and there are several good features as well.\n\nIt's a 5x3 reel slot machine that offers a total of 20 active paylines. Among its features, you can obtain both regular and expanding wilds, scatters and free spins. With wins up to a total of 8098x (€161,964) on the line, it's an exciting option. The volatility is medium-high, while the RTP is at 96.01%.\n\nA traditional Chinese graphic\n\nBetsoft's slot machines are very good in general. They can be fun, beautiful, and sometimes they cannot be any of these things.\n\nA Buddhist temple serves as a background to the reel set. The symbols on them are the Royal Couple (expanding Wild), the dragon, Phoenix, gold ingots, the '88' logo, the green jade dragon statuette, the temple, the money tree (scatter), the dragon's claw with pearl and Jack to Ace cards (low value symbols). The symbol that offers the biggest cash prize is the dragon, and when 5 of them land on the reels, you win 100x your bet.\n\nThe RTP (average return to player percentage) of Dragon & Phoenix is 96.01% or a house advantage of 3.99%. What the RTP tells us is that the slot machine pays out frequently with a big odd win every 40 spins or so.\n\nDragon & Phoenix features an Asian theme, in a form that seems to be quite typical of the region. We find that there are various symbols with the royals at the beginning on the reels, and graphic quality is fairly low in their case. Fortunately, things improve for the higher value and feature symbols. The features come in the form of Emperor and Empress symbols (wilds) and Money Tree scrolls (scatters). The high-value symbols range from dragons, phoenix birds, statues, 88 logos, gold ingots, temples, and pearls.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nDespite being based on 20 active paylines, the game allows bets to be placed anywhere from €0.20 to €20. This way, the bet line can vary from €0.01 to €1.\n\nAs for the prizes that may come to mind, at best the player could receive a reward of up to 8098x the total bet. The payout will reach a maximum value of €161,964, and considering the bet being used, it's a pretty good figure for anyone.\n\nAt the same time, expect the game to have medium-high volatility, so it's not a low-risk situation you're getting yourself into. Many players are willing to take big risks, maybe to get a big win.\n\nThe game revolves mainly around the golden money tree because 3 or more of them in any position on the reels are responsible for activating the free spins feature. Scatter payouts are also awarded to players. For every scatter that appears, 1 free spin is awarded. For example, when 5 scatters are triggered, 5 free spins are awarded, and a maximum of 15 free spins can be obtained. Therefore, free spins can be increased when 3 or more scatters appear.\n\nThe wild symbol will be among the features you get in the game, and its image is of the Emperor and Empress together. It's a substitute, which usually appears in regular size, but can also expand when landing on reels 2 through 5. It will not substitute for the scatter. It's a feature with great potential, especially if you make it expand on multiple columns.\n\nFor the scatter symbol, we have a golden scroll with the image of a Money Tree. This is the trigger for the free spins. You win from them if they appear more than 3 times, and there will be prizes up to 500x paid, as well as 15 free spins to trigger.\n\nAs you can see, there are no really unique features here, but the potential of what's included tends to be quite high. Whether it's the full-reel wild symbols or high volatility free spins, you can get a lot in return from this game.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nChinese Spider has three reels, like traditional Slot Machines. But unlike the latter, it's not a Slot without special features. As you might imagine, the spider is in the lead role here as the symbol that can stack and multiply towards a maximum win of an astounding 3840x multiplied by the winning bet. Winning results can also involve wild multipliers that can reach up to 32x.",

Si vince da loro se appaiono più di 3 volte, e ci saranno premi fino a 500x pagati, oltre a 15 giri gratuiti per innescare.\nCome potete vedere, non ci sono caratteristiche veramente uniche qui, ma il potenziale di ciò che è incluso tende ad essere piuttosto alto. Sia che si tratti dei simboli wild a bobina piena, sia che si tratti di giri gratis con alta volatilità, si può ottenere molto in cambio da questo gioco.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nChinese Spider ha tre bobine, come nelle Slot Machine tradizionali. Ma al contrario di queste ultime, non si tratta di una Slot senza funzioni speciali. Come si poteva immaginare, il ragno è nel ruolo principale qui come il simbolo che può impilare si moltiplica verso una vincita massima di un sorprendente 3840x moltiplicato per la scommessa vincente. I risultati della vincita possono anche coinvolgere i moltiplicatori Wild che possono raggiungere un massimo di 32x.\n\n        ",

It's the story of two legendary creatures of the country, the Asian-style Dragon and the Phoenix bird. The graphics are as impressive as you can imagine, given that it comes from Betsoft, and there are several good features inside.\nIt's a 5×3 reel slot machine that offers a total of 20 active lines. Among its features, you get both regular and expanding wilds, scatters and free spins. With wins up to 8098x in total (€161,964) on the line, it's an exciting option. The volatility is medium-high, while the RTP is at 96.01%.\nTraditional Chinese Graphics\nBetsoft slot machines are generally very good. They can be fun, beautiful, and sometimes they can't be any of these things.\nA Buddhist temple serves as the background to the reel set. The symbols on them are the Royal Couple (expanding Wild), the dragon, the Phoenix, gold ingots, the '88 logo, the green jade dragon statue, the temple, the money tree (scatter), the dragon claw with the pearl and the Jack to Ace cards (low-value symbols). The symbol that offers the largest cash prize is the dragon, and when 5 of them appear on the reels, you win 100x your bet.\nThe RTP (average player return percentage) of Dragon & Phoenix is 96.01% or a house edge of 3.99%. What the RTP tells us is that the slot pays off frequently with a big odd win every 40 spins or so.\nDragon & Phoenix presents an Asian theme, in a form that appears to be quite typical of the region. We find that there are several symbols with the royals at the beginning on the reels, and the graphic quality is rather low in their case. Fortunately, things improve for the higher value and feature symbols. The features come in the form of Emperor and Empress symbols (Wilds) and Money Tree Scrolls (Scatters). The high-value symbols range from dragons, Phoenix birds, statues, 88 logos, gold ingots, temples, and pearls.\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nWhile based on 20 active lines, the game allows bets placed to go anywhere from €0.20 to €20. This way the betting line can range from €0.01 to €1.\nAs for the prizes that may come to mind, the player could receive a reward of up to 8098x total bet at best. The payout will reach a maximum value of €161,964, and considering the bet used, it is a fairly good figure for anyone.\nAt the same time, expect the game to have medium-high volatility, so it's not a low-risk situation you're getting into. Many players are willing to take big risks, maybe to get a big win.\nThe game's return to player is a reasonable 96.01%, and while many will still do better, it's sufficient to not be a problem.\nThe game mainly revolves around the golden money tree, because 3 or more of them in any position on the reels are responsible for activating the Free Spins feature. Scatter payouts are also awarded to players. For each scatter that appears, 1 free spin is awarded. For example, when 5 scatters are launched, you get 5 free spins, and you can get up to 15 free spins. Therefore, Free Spins can be increased when 3 or more other scatters appear.\nThe wild symbol will be among the features you get in the game, and its image is that of the Emperor and Empress together. It's a substitute, which typically appears in regular size, but can also expand when landed on reels 2 to 5. It won't be a substitute for the scatter. It's a feature with great potential, especially if you make it expand over multiple columns.\nFor the scatter symbol, we have a golden scroll with the image of a Money Tree. This is the trigger for free spins. You win from them if they appear more than 3 times, and there will be prizes up to 500x paid, in addition to 15 free spins to trigger.\nAs you can see, there are no truly unique features here, but the potential of what's included tends to be rather high. Whether it’s the full reel wild symbols or the high volatility free spins, you can get a lot back from this game.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nChinese Spider has three reels, like traditional slot machines. But unlike the latter, it's not a slot without special features. As you might imagine, the spider is in the lead role here as the symbol that can stack multiplies to a maximum win of a surprising 3840x multiplied by the winning bet. Winning results can also include Wild multipliers that can reach a maximum of 32x."

It's the story of two legendary creatures of the country, the Asian-style Dragon and the Phoenix bird. The graphics are as impressive as you can imagine, given that it comes from Betsoft, and there are several good features inside.\nIt's a 5×3 reel slot machine that offers a total of 20 active lines. Among its features, you get both regular and expanding wilds, scatters and free spins. With wins up to 8098x in total (€161,964) on the line, it's an exciting option. The volatility is medium-high, while the RTP is at 96.01%.\nTraditional Chinese Graphics\nBetsoft slot machines are generally very good. They can be fun, beautiful, and sometimes they can't be any of these things.\nA Buddhist temple serves as the background to the reel set. The symbols on them are the Royal Couple (expanding Wild), the dragon, the Phoenix, gold ingots, the '88 logo, the green jade dragon statue, the temple, the money tree (scatter), the dragon claw with the pearl and the Jack to Ace cards (low-value symbols). The symbol that offers the largest cash prize is the dragon, and when 5 of them appear on the reels, you win 100x your bet.\nThe RTP (average player return percentage) of Dragon & Phoenix is 96.01% or a house edge of 3.99%. What the RTP tells us is that the slot pays off frequently with a big odd win every 40 spins or so.\nDragon & Phoenix presents an Asian theme, in a form that appears to be quite typical of the region. We find that there are several symbols with the royals at the beginning on the reels, and the graphic quality is rather low in their case. Fortunately, things improve for the higher value and feature symbols. The features come in the form of Emperor and Empress symbols (Wilds) and Money Tree Scrolls (Scatters). The high-value symbols range from dragons, Phoenix birds, statues, 88 logos, gold ingots, temples, and pearls.\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nWhile based on 20 active lines, the game allows bets placed to go anywhere from €0.20 to €20. This way the betting line can range from €0.01 to €1.\nAs for the prizes that may come to mind, the player could receive a reward of up to 8098x total bet at best. The payout will reach a maximum value of €161,964, and considering the bet used, it is a fairly good figure for anyone.\nAt the same time, expect the game to have medium-high volatility, so it's not a low-risk situation you're getting into. Many players are willing to take big risks, maybe to get a big win.\nThe game's return to player is a reasonable 96.01%, and while many will still do better, it's sufficient to not be a problem.\nThe game mainly revolves around the golden money tree, because 3 or more of them in any position on the reels are responsible for activating the Free Spins feature. Scatter payouts are also awarded to players. For each scatter that appears, 1 free spin is awarded. For example, when 5 scatters are launched, you get 5 free spins, and you can get up to 15 free spins. Therefore, Free Spins can be increased when 3 or more other scatters appear.\nThe wild symbol will be among the features you get in the game, and its image is that of the Emperor and Empress together. It's a substitute, which typically appears in regular size, but can also expand when landed on reels 2 to 5. It won't be a substitute for the scatter. It's a feature with great potential, especially if you make it expand over multiple columns.\nFor the scatter symbol, we have a golden scroll with the image of a Money Tree. This is the trigger for free spins. You win from them if they appear more than 3 times, and there will be prizes up to 500x paid, in addition to 15 free spins to trigger.\nAs you can see, there are no truly unique features here, but the potential of what's included tends to be rather high. Whether it’s the full reel wild symbols or the high volatility free spins, you can get a lot back from this game.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nChinese Spider has three reels, like traditional slot machines. But unlike the latter, it's not a slot without special features. As you might imagine, the spider is in the lead role here as the symbol that can stack multiplies to a maximum win of a surprising 3840x multiplied by the winning bet. Winning results can also include Wild multipliers that can reach a maximum of 32x.\n            ",

It's the story of two legendary creatures of the country, the Asian-style Dragon and the Phoenix bird. The graphics are as impressive as you can imagine, given that it comes from Betsoft, and there are several good features inside.\nIt's a 5×3 reel slot machine that offers a total of 20 active lines. Among its features, you get both regular and expanding wilds, scatters and free spins. With wins up to 8098x in total (€161,964) on the line, it's an exciting option. The volatility is medium-high, while the RTP is at 96.01%.\nTraditional Chinese Graphics\nBetsoft slot machines are generally very good. They can be fun, beautiful, and sometimes they can't be any of these things.\nA Buddhist temple serves as the background to the reel set. The symbols on them are the Royal Couple (expanding Wild), the dragon, the Phoenix, gold ingots, the '88 logo, the green jade dragon statue, the temple, the money tree (scatter), the dragon claw with the pearl and the Jack to Ace cards (low-value symbols). The symbol that offers the largest cash prize is the dragon, and when 5 of them appear on the reels, you win 100x your bet.\nThe RTP (average player return percentage) of Dragon & Phoenix is 96.01% or a house edge of 3.99%. What the RTP tells us is that the slot pays off frequently with a big odd win every 40 spins or so.\nDragon & Phoenix presents an Asian theme, in a form that appears to be quite typical of the region. We find that there are several symbols with the royals at the beginning on the reels, and the graphic quality is rather low in their case. Fortunately, things improve for the higher value and feature symbols. The features come in the form of Emperor and Empress symbols (Wilds) and Money Tree Scrolls (Scatters). The high-value symbols range from dragons, Phoenix birds, statues, 88 logos, gold ingots, temples, and pearls.\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nWhile based on 20 active lines, the game allows bets placed to go anywhere from €0.20 to €20. This way the betting line can range from €0.01 to €1.\nAs for the prizes that may come to mind, the player could receive a reward of up to 8098x total bet at best. The payout will reach a maximum value of €161,964, and considering the bet used, it is a fairly good figure for anyone.\nAt the same time, expect the game to have medium-high volatility, so it's not a low-risk situation you're getting into. Many players are willing to take big risks, maybe to get a big win.\nThe game's return to player is a reasonable 96.01%, and while many will still do better, it's sufficient to not be a problem.\nThe game mainly revolves around the golden money tree, because 3 or more of them in any position on the reels are responsible for activating the Free Spins feature. Scatter payouts are also awarded to players. For each scatter that appears, 1 free spin is awarded. For example, when 5 scatters are launched, you get 5 free spins, and you can get up to 15 free spins. Therefore, Free Spins can be increased when 3 or more other scatters appear.\nThe wild symbol will be among the features you get in the game, and its image is that of the Emperor and Empress together. It's a substitute, which typically appears in regular size, but can also expand when landed on reels 2 to 5. It won't be a substitute for the scatter. It's a feature with great potential, especially if you make it expand over multiple columns.\nFor the scatter symbol, we have a golden scroll with the image of a Money Tree. This is the trigger for free spins. You win from them if they appear more than 3 times, and there will be prizes up to 500x paid, in addition to 15 free spins to trigger.\nAs you can see, there are no truly unique features here, but the potential of what's included tends to be rather high. Whether it’s the full reel wild symbols or the high volatility free spins, you can get a lot back from this game.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nChinese Spider has three reels, like traditional slot machines. But unlike the latter, it's not a slot without special features. As you might imagine, the spider is in the lead role here as the symbol that can stack multiplies to a maximum win of a surprising 3840x multiplied by the winning bet. Winning results can also include Wild multipliers that can reach a maximum of 32x.\n            ",

The payout will reach a maximum value of €161,964, and considering the bet used, it is a fairly good figure for anyone.\nAt the same time, expect the game to have medium-high volatility, so it's not a low-risk situation you're getting into. Many players are willing to take big risks, maybe to get a big win.\nThe game's return to player is a reasonable 96.01%, and while many will still do better, it's sufficient to not be a problem.\nThe game mainly revolves around the golden money tree, because 3 or more of them in any position on the reels are responsible for activating the Free Spins feature. Scatter payouts are also awarded to players. For each scatter that appears, 1 free spin is awarded. For example, when 5 scatters are launched, you get 5 free spins, and you can get up to 15 free spins. Therefore, Free Spins can be increased when 3 or more other scatters appear.\nThe wild symbol will be among the features you get in the game, and its image is that of the Emperor and Empress together. It's a substitute, which typically appears in regular size, but can also expand when landed on reels 2 to 5. It won't be a substitute for the scatter. It's a feature with great potential, especially if you make it expand over multiple columns.\nFor the scatter symbol, we have a golden scroll with the image of a Money Tree. This is the trigger for free spins. You win from them if they appear more than 3 times, and there will be prizes up to 500x paid, in addition to 15 free spins to trigger.\nAs you can see, there are no truly unique features here, but the potential of what's included tends to be rather high. Whether it’s the full reel wild symbols or the high volatility free spins, you can get a lot back from this game.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nChinese Spider has three reels, like traditional slot machines. But unlike the latter, it's not a slot without special features. As you might imagine, the spider is in the lead role here as the symbol that can stack multiplies to a maximum win of a surprising 3840x multiplied by the winning bet. Winning results can also include Wild multipliers that can reach a maximum of 32x.\n        ",
