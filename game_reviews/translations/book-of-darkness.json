The game revolves around this power struggle between the two main characters, who will try to overpower each other, also thanks to the help of a magical book, the Book of Darkness.\n\nClash for Power and Shadowform\nThe clash between good and evil forces in Book of Darkness takes place through the Clash for Power and Shadowform features. In these game phases, the warrior and the magician battle to the death and offer excellent rewards every time one of them prevails over the other.\n\nWhen the symbols of the warrior and the magician align near the symbol of the Book of Darkness, the Clash for Power feature is activated. Before starting, you are asked to \"bet\" on the winning character. Choose wisely because you can win more free spins! In fact, this special phase consists of 10 free spins during which the symbols of the warrior and the magician battle, expand, and progressively fill the HERO METER that measures who is winning.\n\nIf your chosen character prevails, you can proceed with the Shadowform feature, which provides an extra 10 free spins. If the battle is won by the magician, in the 10 extra free spins, he will expand the symbols to 5. If the huntress wins the fight, she will offer a 5x multiplier on all winnings from the 10 extra free spins.\n\nTechnical and General Details of the Game\nThe slot Book of Darkness features a classic video slot display in 3x5 format, with 10 paylines. The RTP is 96.23%, and the volatility is high, making it a game that offers a lower number of wins on average, but higher amounts. The minimum bet per spin is 10 cents.\n\nThe game is compatible with Windows, iOS, and Android operating systems and is available on all types of devices, both desktop and mobile.\n\nGame Evaluation\nBook of Darkness is the classic example of what can be defined as excellent player engagement. In fact, there is no spin in which you do not think about the moment when the huntress and the magician will clash. The beauty is that this anticipation is not only due to the potentially high winnings but also to the competition itself.\n\nWhen you manage to capture the player's imagination and competitive spirit, regardless of the winnings, you genuinely offer a winning slot model regardless, as it is the fun that matters most. And with Book of Darkness, Betsoft really offers a way to have fun, as well as win interesting prizes.\n\nFAQs\nHow do you play Book of Darkness?\n\nIn addition to the base game in which you try to align identical symbols along the paylines, the Book of Darkness slot features special gameplay phases where you can choose one of the two fighting characters (a warrior and a magician) to obtain additional free spins, with multipliers and expandable symbols. Multipliers multiply payouts, while expandable symbols offer more chances to get winning combinations along the paylines.\n\nHow much does the Book of Darkness slot pay?\n\nThe Book of Darkness slot has an RTP of over 96%, so it is of good quality. The volatility is high, so it is a slot that prefers to pay out fewer times but with higher payouts.\n\nWhere can you play the Book of Darkness slot?\n\nYou can try the Book of Darkness slot for free on this page without any deposit. If you like it, here you can find the best ADM-regulated casinos where you can play it with real money.\n            ",
