The 2D graphics, inspired by the characters from the legendary novel Alice in Wonderland, feature the Queen of Hearts and her King, who are opposed by the cruel Queen of Spades. With the help of the Heart royalty, players can win the Jackpot Bonus and Free Spins - as described in the Slotjava review. \n\nWith medium volatility, Game of Cards can be played at various bet levels, with up to 2,000 coins to be won on every spin of the base game. As the cards align in suitable combinations, players can win the Free Spins round, a Bonus game, and the Jackpot Bonus. All 30 paylines of this 5-reel slot machine are fixed, with the lowest bet option starting at just €0.30 per round. If you feel more daring, you can increase your stake up to a maximum of €30 per spin.\n\nThe Queen of Hearts symbol, acting as the slot’s wildcard, can multiply your bets via the 2,000x line Jackpot. Whenever players receive five identical Queen of Hearts symbols, they automatically activate the multiplier, leading to huge winnings. Meanwhile, the game’s three special icons offer additional chances to grow your betting portfolio. The Wicked Queen of Spades symbol is a Scatter that triggers a round of up to 30 Free Spins with 30x multipliers. The amount of Free Spins and Bonus Multipliers depends on how successful players are at progressing through the mini-game before the function starts. \n\nAnother Bonus game featured in the slot is activated by three blue Wizard icons on reels 1, 2, and 3 of the machine. Players must select one of six stones to overturn and increase their prize values. Choosing the incorrect stone will end the Bonus Game and void all of your Bonus winnings. This game offers the chance to win the Progressive Jackpot by landing four or five Game of Cards logo symbols, appearing randomly anywhere on the reels.\n\nOverall, the fairy tale-style of this Giocaonline slot game, available for both free and real money play, makes it fun and engaging. The Bonus and Multiplier options can truly take your winning combinations to the next level, while the Jackpot Bonus promises a substantial cash prize for any lucky player.
