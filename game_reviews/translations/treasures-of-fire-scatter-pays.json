To win, you need to create rows of at least eight identical symbols. The game includes the Autoplay feature that allows you to play without clicking the Start button every time, and you can set between 5 and 999 automatic spins. The lightning button accelerates the speed at which the symbols fall. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.5%, and this is a high volatility game.\n\nSymbols and Payouts\n\nThe symbols with the lowest value are the colored gems, and the dragon eggs are the ones with much higher payouts. The most valuable symbol in Treasures of Fire is the egg that is about to hatch, with the baby dragon visible inside the shell. The symbols pay out in any position on the reels. The dragon's eye is the Scatter symbol, and it rewards the players with free spins ranging from 10 to 20. If during the Free Spins round, three more Scatter symbols land, players get an additional 5 bonus spins. Another interesting feature is called Fire Breath, which grants multipliers to apply to the payouts. Multipliers are also present in the base game and can randomly appear with a range of 2x to 100x.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nThe volatility of Treasures of Fire is high, which means that players can win less often, but the payouts are substantial. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.5%, which is a respectable value for an online slot game.\n\nFree Spins and Multipliers\n\nTreasures of Fire has a Free Spins mode that can be activated by the dragon's eye Scatter symbol. The number of free spins ranges from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 20. Three or more Scatter symbols landing during the Free Spins round will trigger 5 bonus spins. Multipliers ranging from 2x to 100x can also randomly appear in the base game and during the Fire Breath feature.\n\nMaximum Payout and Betting Range\n\nIn Treasures of Fire, the minimum bet is 0.10 €, and the maximum payout is 20,000 times the value of the player's bet. This makes it a high-risk, high-reward online slot game. The game is designed for both small and big bettors, and the betting range can accommodate players with different bankrolls.\n\n        \n            ",

In this game, the aim is to steal as many dragon eggs as possible, with the eggs' value determining the size of the payout you stand to win. The game features cascading reels and a Scatter symbol that triggers free spins. You can play Treasures of Fire from as little as 0.10€ per spin, with a maximum payout that equals 20,000 times the bet.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe Treasures of Fire game features a 6x5 grid and works on the cascading reels mechanism. Every time you have a winning row of eight or more symbols, those symbols are replaced with new ones, increasing the chances of even bigger wins. Additionally, the game has various bonus features, including free spins, multipliers, and Fire Breath to improve your chances of winning.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nTreasures of Fire has ten symbols that include colored gems, dragon eggs, and a Scatter symbol. Players are rewarded when they land eight or more identical symbols in a row on the grid. The Scatter symbol (the dragon's eye) activates the free spins, while the Fire Breath feature triggers multipliers that players can apply to their winnings. Multipliers can appear during both the base game and the bonus rounds. Additionally, the game's dragon randomly activates a bonus feature (the Dragon Bonus) that also increases the potential payout.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nThe Treasures of Fire game is classified as high volatility, which means that while wins may come less frequently, they tend to be much bigger. On top of that, this game has an RTP of 95.5%, which is impressive and means that over the long-term, players can expect to get back 95.5% of the money they wager on the game.\n\nMaximum Payout\n\nThe maximum possible payout in Treasures of Fire is 20,000 times the bet made. Thus, if a player wagers the highest bet amount possible and wins, they can expect to walk away with a sizeable chunk of change.\n\n        \n            ",

Our winged monster lurks in the depths of the mountain, guarding its eggs from anyone who dares to steal them. The aim of the game is just that. The more eggs you manage to steal, the higher your winnings will be!\n\nThe graphics for Treasures of Fire are quite simple, with red being the dominant color. The grid at the center of the game is watched over by the dragon, but it serves a functional purpose rather than just being decorative. In fact, the dragon will randomly activate a bonus feature, which we will discuss later. The buttons for placing your bets are large and spaced quite far apart from the grid.\n\nFeatures of Treasures of Fire\n\nThe grid is slightly larger than usual, featuring 6 reels and 5 rows. The gameplay mechanism is cascading, so every time a winning combination is created, the paying symbols are removed and replaced with brand new ones. To win, you need to create rows of at least eight identical symbols. The minimum bet is 0.10 € and the maximum payout is 20,000 times the bet!\n\nThe Autoplay feature allows you to play without clicking the Start button every time, and you can set between 5 and 999 automatic spins. The lightning button, on the other hand, accelerates the speed at which the symbols fall.\n\nWe can conclude the description with the volatility, which is high in this case, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) which equals a respectable 95.5%.\n\nHow to win at Treasures of Fire\n\nThe colored gems are the symbols with the lowest value, while the dragon eggs pay much more. The most valuable symbol of all is the egg that is about to hatch, with the baby dragon visible inside the shell. The symbols pay out in any position on the reels. The dragon's eye is our Scatter symbol and it rewards us with free spins, ranging from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 20.\n\nIf during the Free Spins round, three more Scatter symbols land, we will get an additional 5 bonus spins. Another interesting feature is called Fire Breath, which grants multipliers to apply to our winnings.\n\nBut multipliers are also present in the base game. In fact, from time to time and completely randomly, the symbols can be accompanied by a multiplier ranging from 2x to 100x.\n\nFAQ\n\nCan I try Treasures of Fire before playing with real money?\n\nOf course, on our website, you can find the demo version that allows you to play without spending real money, so you can get familiar with the game.\n\nWhat is the volatility like?\n\nIn Treasures of Fire, the volatility is high, so you win less often but when you do, you win big.\n\nWhat is the maximum payout?\n\nIn Treasures of Fire, you can win up to a maximum of 20,000 times the value of your bet.\n            ",

Our winged monster lurks in the depths of the mountain, guarding its eggs from anyone who dares to steal them. The aim of the game is just that. The more eggs you manage to steal, the higher your winnings will be!\n\nThe graphics for Treasures of Fire are quite simple, with red being the dominant color. The grid at the center of the game is watched over by the dragon, but it serves a functional purpose rather than just being decorative. In fact, the dragon will randomly activate a bonus feature, which we will discuss later. The buttons for placing your bets are large and spaced quite far apart from the grid.\n\nFeatures of Treasures of Fire\n\nThe grid is slightly larger than usual, featuring 6 reels and 5 rows. The gameplay mechanism is cascading, so every time a winning combination is created, the paying symbols are removed and replaced with brand new ones. To win, you need to create rows of at least eight identical symbols. The minimum bet is 0.10 € and the maximum payout is 20,000 times the bet!\n\nThe Autoplay feature allows you to play without clicking the Start button every time, and you can set between 5 and 999 automatic spins. The lightning button, on the other hand, accelerates the speed at which the symbols fall.\n\nWe can conclude the description with the volatility, which is high in this case, and the theoretical return to player (RTP) which equals a respectable 95.5%.\n\nHow to win at Treasures of Fire\n\nThe colored gems are the symbols with the lowest value, while the dragon eggs pay much more. The most valuable symbol of all is the egg that is about to hatch, with the baby dragon visible inside the shell. The symbols pay out in any position on the reels. The dragon's eye is our Scatter symbol and it rewards us with free spins, ranging from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 20.\n\nIf during the Free Spins round, three more Scatter symbols land, we will get an additional 5 bonus spins. Another interesting feature is called Fire Breath, which grants multipliers to apply to our winnings.\n\nBut multipliers are also present in the base game. In fact, from time to time and completely randomly, the symbols can be accompanied by a multiplier ranging from 2x to 100x.\n\nFAQ\n\nCan I try Treasures of Fire before playing with real money?\n\nOf course, on our website, you can find the demo version that allows you to play without spending real money, so you can get familiar with the game.\n\nWhat is the volatility like?\n\nIn Treasures of Fire, the volatility is high, so you win less often but when you do, you win big.\n\nWhat is the maximum payout?\n\nIn Treasures of Fire, you can win up to a maximum of 20,000 times the value of your bet.\n            ",
