The game is developed by World Match, a top-notch game developer known for designing immersive slot games.\n\nThe graphics are well-designed to create an atmosphere that perfectly reflects the theme of the game. The Golden-framed grid is dominated by an eagle, and on the sides, we have yellow flowers swaying with the wind. The music is an oriental jingle with western-style sounds mixed in, adding to the overall gaming experience.\n\nThe 5x3 grid has 10 fixed paylines, and players can bet anywhere from €0.01 to €5 per line. Aligning adjacent symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right can help you win.\n\nThe game also offers automatic spin options ranging from 5 to 1,000 or infinite. Within the menu, there's a fast-play cursor that can be moved to the right to speed up the reel rotation.\n\nThe low-value symbols are J, Q, K, and A. For higher rewards, players should focus on landing the boots, the treasure, and the scimitar, or try to bet on the wolf and the queen.\n\nGenghis Khan himself is the wild symbol in the game, and he functions as a joker to replace all symbols but the special ones. During Free Spins, if the Wild symbol appears on the first reel, randomly, some symbols will also become Wild. The horse is the Scatter symbol, and it rewards the player with a number of free spins ranging from 3 to 7.\n\nOverall, Genghis' Reel is an excellent slot game that is both immersive and rewarding for players.\n        ",

The background shows a flowery valley and some village houses where Genghis Khan was born. The Golden-framed grid is dominated by an eagle, and there are yellow flowers on the sides. The music is an oriental jingle with western-style sounds mixed in.\n\nGameplay and Paylines\n\nGenghis’ Reel has a simple 5x3 grid with 10 fixed paylines. Players can bet from a minimum of €0.01 to a maximum of €5 per line. Wins are formed by aligning adjacent symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. The game also features automatic spins ranging from 5 to 1,000 or even infinite, and a fast-play cursor to speed up the reel rotation.\n\nSymbols and Rewards\n\nGenghis’ Reel has four non-theme symbols: J, Q, K, and A, which have low value. The boots, treasure, and scimitar symbols offer more substantial sums, while the wolf and queen symbols can provide significant payouts. The Wild symbol is Genghis Khan himself, and he can replace all other regular symbols except special ones. When he appears on a reel flown over by the eagle, he expands vertically, increasing the chances of getting winning combinations. The shield with a 2x multiplier is another special symbol, and the multiplier can reach up to x8 depending on the number of shields landed. \n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nGenghis Khan is the Wild symbol, and he expands vertically when flying over an eagle. When the Wild symbol appears on the first reel during Free Spins, some random symbols become Wild. The horse symbol is the Scatter symbol, and it rewards players with a number of free spins that range from 3 to 7.\n\n        \n            ",

With an eagle flying over the reels and a flowery valley in the background, players are transported to ancient Asia. The sound effects and music blend oriental melodies with western-style sounds.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nGenghis’ Reel has a simple 5x3 grid with 10 fixed paylines. Players can bet from €0.01 to €5 per payline. Winning combinations are made by aligning adjacent symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right. The game features an automatic spin option, which ranges from 5 to 1,000 or infinite. Fast-play and other settings can also be adjusted from the menu.\n\nSymbol Values and Paylines\n\nThere are four non-themed symbols in Genghis’ Reel (J, Q, K, A) with low value. Players can aim for higher sums with the boots, treasure, and scimitar symbols or by landing the wolf and queen symbols. There are 10 fixed paylines, and players win by aligning adjacent symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nGenghis Khan is the Wild symbol and can replace all symbols except special ones. If the Wild symbol appears on a reel flown over by the eagle, it expands vertically, increasing the chances of winning combinations. The shield with a 2x multiplier is another special symbol that can bring up to an x8 multiplier. The horse symbol is the Scatter and rewards players with three to seven free spins.\n\nOverall Game Review\n\nGenghis’ Reel is a simple yet exciting slot game that features excellent graphics and a soundtrack that immerses players in the world of Genghis Khan. With a Wild symbol that expands and the potential for a multiplier up to x8, players have the chance to win big. The Scatter symbol also adds an extra layer of excitement by rewarding players with free spins. Overall, Genghis’ Reel is a game that is definitely worth a spin!\n\n        \n            ",

In the background, we can see a flowery valley and some village houses where Genghis Khan was born. The Golden-framed grid is, instead, dominated by an eagle that will play a role in the game, but more on that later. On the sides, there are yellow flowers swayed by the wind.\n\nThe music is an oriental jingle with western-style sounds mixed in.\n\nMain Features of Genghis Khan Slot\nThe grid is a simple 5x3, with 10 fixed paylines on which you can bet from a minimum of €0.01 to a maximum of €5. These figures refer to the cost of each line.\n\nYou win by aligning adjacent symbols starting from the left reel and proceeding to the right.\n\nYou can set a number of automatic spins ranging from 5 to 1,000, or even infinite.\n\nWithin the menu, there is the fast-play cursor. Moving it to the right will speed up the reel rotation.\n\nSymbols and Features of Genghis Khan Slot\nNon-theme symbols consist of only 4: J, Q, K, A. As in all slots, they have low value.\n\nTo see more substantial sums, focus on the boots, the treasure, and the scimitar. Or, if you're lucky enough, bet on the wolf and the queen.\n\nGenghis Khan himself is our Wild symbol. He covers the function of a Joker and can replace all symbols except special ones. When he appears on a reel flown over by the eagle, he expands vertically, increasing our chances of getting winning combinations.\n\nDuring Free Spins, if the Wild symbol appears on the first reel, randomly, some symbols will also become Wild.\n\nAnother special symbol is the shield with a 2x multiplier. Depending on the number of shields landed on the reels, the multiplier can reach x8.\n\nThe horse is the Scatter symbol and rewards us with a number of free spins ranging from 3 to 7.\n        ",
