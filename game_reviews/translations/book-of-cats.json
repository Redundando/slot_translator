In questa slot a firma BGaming invece la protagonista è Bastet, la dea gatta ventata dagli egizi sin dai tempi antichi. Il gatto era infatti un animale sacro tenuto con ogni cura e regolato da leggi specifiche. Infatti, chi osava fargli del male o decideva di portarlo al di là del Nilo, fuori dalla regione, veniva punito con la pena di morte!\nPer rendere al meglio il carattere mitologico della slot, la BGaming si è impegnata nella creazione di una grafica favolosa sotto ogni punto di vista. Dai simboli super definiti, alla cura dei dettagli, ogni aspetto grafico di questa slot ha il potere di farci immergere in un’atmosfera magica. La griglia di gioco, posizionata sulle rive del Nilo in una giornata assolata, ha 5 bracieri alla base che si accendono quando si attiva una funzione speciale. Al di sotto di essi ci sono i tasti principali e poche altre informazioni, così che la funzionalità del gioco risulta più fluida e più intuitiva. Questo non vuol dire che non siano presenti altre impostazioni, semplicemente sono nascoste e accessibili attraverso il tasto menù.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nIn base alla situazione di gioco, la griglia ha due dimensioni. Durante il gioco base ha 5 rulli e 3 righe, con un sesto rullo bloccato tranne che per una cella. Durante i Free Spins quest’ultimo rullo si sblocca e la griglia diventa una 6×3.\nLe linee di pagamento sono 10 e fisse e si vince allineando dei simboli a partire dal primo rullo a destra e avanzando verso sinistra.\nLa puntata minima è di 0,01 € a linea, ciò vuol dire che uno spin costerà appena 0,10 €. Nulla vieta comunque di aumentare la nostra puntata a piacimento sino a un massimo di 10 €.\nSi possono attivare da dieci giri automatici all’infinito.\nL’ RTP è del 94%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nAnche in Book of Cats abbiamo i classici simboli di basso valore buoni per una scala reale, quindi dal dieci all’asso. La croce con la testa di gatto vale molto di più, arrivando a pagare sino a 1.000 volte la puntata, stesso valore dilla maschera da gatto. La tessera con il fatto vale sino a 2.500 volte la puntata, mentre la dea Bastet arriva a ricompensarci con 7.500 volte.\nIl libro dorato ha la doppia funzione di Wild e Scatter. Nel primo caso sostituisce tutti i simboli, nel secondo ricompensa con 10 Free Spins. A questo punto vedremo sbloccare il sesto rullo. Durante i Free Spins un simbolo del tutto nuovo sarà a espansione, ossia si estenderà per uno o più rulli, regalandoci tantissime combinazioni vincenti.\nIn Book of Cats c’è anche la possibilità di usufruire della funzione Gamble per raddoppiare l’ultima vincita o perderla completamente.\n",

Whoever dared to harm them or take them across the Nile outside of their region was punished with the death penalty!\n\nTo enhance the mythical character of this slot, BGaming has worked hard in creating fabulous graphics that are captivating in every way. From the highly defined symbols to the attention to detail, every visual aspect of this slot has the power to transport us to a magical atmosphere. The game grid, located on the banks of the Nile on a sunny day, has five braziers at the base that light up when a special feature is activated.

During the base game, it has five reels and three rows, with a sixth reel locked except for one cell.

The cross with the cat's head is worth much more, paying up to 1,000 times the bet, the same value as the cat mask. The card with the fact is worth up to 2,500 times the bet, while the goddess Bastet rewards us with up to 7,500 times.\n\nThe golden book has a dual function as Wild and Scatter.

However, in this BGaming signature slot, the protagonist is Bastet, the cat goddess worshipped by ancient Egyptians. Cats were sacred animals, and they were regulated by specific laws. Whoever dared to harm them or take them across the Nile outside of their region was punished with the death penalty!\n\nTo enhance the mythical character of this slot, BGaming has worked hard in creating fabulous graphics that are captivating in every way. From the highly defined symbols to the attention to detail, every visual aspect of this slot has the power to transport us to a magical atmosphere. The game grid, located on the banks of the Nile on a sunny day, has five braziers at the base that light up when a special feature is activated. Below them are the main buttons and a few other information, making the game functionality more fluid and intuitive. This does not mean that other settings are not present; they are simply hidden and accessible through the menu button.\n\nSlot Features\n\nDepending on the game situation, the grid has two dimensions. During the base game, it has five reels and three rows, with a sixth reel locked except for one cell. During the Free Spins, this last reel unlocks, and the grid becomes a 6×3.\n\nThere are 10 fixed paylines, and you win by aligning symbols starting from the first reel on the right and advancing towards the left.\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.01 per line, meaning that one spin will cost just €0.10. You can increase your bet up to €10 if you wish.\n\nYou can activate 10 automatic spins to infinity.\n\nThe RTP is 94%.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\n\nEven in Book of Cats, there are the classic low-value symbols that are good for a royal flush, ranging from ten to ace. The cross with the cat's head is worth much more, paying up to 1,000 times the bet, the same value as the cat mask. The card with the fact is worth up to 2,500 times the bet, while the goddess Bastet rewards us with up to 7,500 times.\n\nThe golden book has a dual function as Wild and Scatter. In the first case, it replaces all symbols; in the second case, it rewards you with 10 Free Spins. At this point, the sixth reel is unlocked. During the Free Spins, a totally new symbol will expand, occupying one or more reels, giving us numerous winning combinations.\n\nIn Book of Cats, there is also the opportunity to use the Gamble feature to double the last win or lose it completely. \n\nAs an experienced gambler, you will undoubtedly appreciate the mythical and captivating graphics of Book of Cats, as well as its numerous features and significant rewards. Give it a try and immerse yourself in the magical world of ancient Egypt and its feline deities!\n            ",

However, in this BGaming signature slot, the protagonist is Bastet, the cat goddess worshipped by ancient Egyptians. Cats were sacred animals, and they were regulated by specific laws. Whoever dared to harm them or take them across the Nile outside of their region was punished with the death penalty!\n\nTo enhance the mythical character of this slot, BGaming has worked hard in creating fabulous graphics that are captivating in every way. From the highly defined symbols to the attention to detail, every visual aspect of this slot has the power to transport us to a magical atmosphere. The game grid, located on the banks of the Nile on a sunny day, has five braziers at the base that light up when a special feature is activated. Below them are the main buttons and a few other information, making the game functionality more fluid and intuitive. This does not mean that other settings are not present; they are simply hidden and accessible through the menu button.\n\nSlot Features\n\nDepending on the game situation, the grid has two dimensions. During the base game, it has five reels and three rows, with a sixth reel locked except for one cell. During the Free Spins, this last reel unlocks, and the grid becomes a 6×3.\n\nThere are 10 fixed paylines, and you win by aligning symbols starting from the first reel on the right and advancing towards the left.\n\nThe minimum bet is €0.01 per line, meaning that one spin will cost just €0.10. You can increase your bet up to €10 if you wish.\n\nYou can activate 10 automatic spins to infinity.\n\nThe RTP is 94%.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\n\nEven in Book of Cats, there are the classic low-value symbols that are good for a royal flush, ranging from ten to ace. The cross with the cat's head is worth much more, paying up to 1,000 times the bet, the same value as the cat mask. The card with the fact is worth up to 2,500 times the bet, while the goddess Bastet rewards us with up to 7,500 times.\n\nThe golden book has a dual function as Wild and Scatter. In the first case, it replaces all symbols; in the second case, it rewards you with 10 Free Spins. At this point, the sixth reel is unlocked. During the Free Spins, a totally new symbol will expand, occupying one or more reels, giving us numerous winning combinations.\n\nIn Book of Cats, there is also the opportunity to use the Gamble feature to double the last win or lose it completely. \n\nAs an experienced gambler, you will undoubtedly appreciate the mythical and captivating graphics of Book of Cats, as well as its numerous features and significant rewards. Give it a try and immerse yourself in the magical world of ancient Egypt and its feline deities!\n            ",
