Neptune's Fortune Megaways is also part of this trend, as the title suggests, with the protagonist being Neptune, lord of the sea and storms, venerated by both the Romans and the Greeks under the name of Poseidon.\n\nAs usual, iSoftBet has done an excellent job graphically, although we must say that the real strength of the slot lies in the bonus system offered.

The slot also offers the option to activate between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins.\n\nThe RTP value is 96.03%, and the volatility is high, so we'll have less frequent wins but much higher rewards.\n\nSymbols and functionality\nAmong the features of Neptune's Fortune Megaways is the cascade function, meaning that after each paying combination, winning symbols explode and are replaced by others.\n\nThe symbols are of low and high value.

Whenever it appears, some bubbles rise from its mouth and randomly hit one of the four chests above the game grid. Most of the time, the chest will open and give us a multiplier between x2 and x5.
