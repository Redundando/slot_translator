Neptune's Fortune Megaways is also part of this trend, as the title suggests, with the protagonist being Neptune, lord of the sea and storms, venerated by both the Romans and the Greeks under the name of Poseidon.\n\nAs usual, iSoftBet has done an excellent job graphically, although we must say that the real strength of the slot lies in the bonus system offered.

The slot also offers the option to activate between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins.\n\nThe RTP value is 96.03%, and the volatility is high, so we'll have less frequent wins but much higher rewards.\n\nSymbols and functionality\nAmong the features of Neptune's Fortune Megaways is the cascade function, meaning that after each paying combination, winning symbols explode and are replaced by others.\n\nThe symbols are of low and high value.

Whenever it appears, some bubbles rise from its mouth and randomly hit one of the four chests above the game grid. Most of the time, the chest will open and give us a multiplier between x2 and x5.

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nBonus System\n\nNeptune's Fortune Megaways has an excellent bonus system offered. The Wild symbol is an oyster with a pearl inside, substituting for all symbols except for the Scatter. Whenever it appears, we can win a multiplier between x2 and x5. If the central chest opens, then we will have a chance to win one of the available jackpots: Mini, Minor, Major, and Grand.\n\nMegaways\n\nThis slot offers 46,656 Megaways to win, and the grid has 5 reels, but the rows can vary between 3 and 6. It also offers the option to activate between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins. The RTP value is 96.03%, and the volatility is high, which means that we'll have less frequent wins but much higher rewards.\n\nJackpot Feature\n\nNeptune's Fortune Megaways offers four jackpots, namely Mini, Minor, Major, and Grand. The central chest can open after the Wild symbol appears, giving us a chance to win any of the available jackpots. The Mini is worth 20x the bet, Minor 50x, Major 200x, and Grand 1,000x.\n\nFree Spins\n\nIf the Scatter (Neptune's trident) appears four times, we get 10 Free Spins. If it comes out five times, we're entitled to 12 Free Spins, and with six symbols, the Free Spins are 15. Low-value symbols are removed during Free Spins, and Wilds can continue to give us a multiplier as in the base game.\n\nSymbols and Gameplay\n\nThe symbols in Neptune's Fortune Megaways are of low and high value. The first group includes playing cards from 10 to Ace, while the second group includes thematic icons: the starfish, the shell, the octopus, and Neptune. The Wild symbol is an oyster with a pearl inside that substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter. The cascade function is also available, meaning that after each paying combination, winning symbols explode and are replaced by others.\n\n        \n            ",

Its minimum bet is 20 coins, and the value of each coin is up to the player to decide. The Megaways mechanics provide a total of 46,656 ways to win, and the slot also has the option to activate between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins. Additionally, the RTP value is 96.03%, and the volatility is high.\n\nGraphics\n\niSoftBet has done an excellent job graphically with Neptune's Fortune Megaways. The game grid is located at the bottom of the sea, surrounded by seaweed, corals, and other aquatic plants with jackpots on the right and start buttons on the left.\n\nSymbol design\n\nThe symbols in Neptune's Fortune Megaways comprise low and high-value symbols. Low-value symbols include playing cards from 10 to Ace while the second group includes thematic icons: the starfish, the shell, the octopus, and Neptune himself. The Wild symbol is an oyster with a pearl inside, substituting for all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is the mythical Neptune's trident.\n\nBonus system\n\nThe bonus system in Neptune's Fortune Megaways is one of its strengths. The slot offers a cascade function, where winning symbols explode and are replaced by new ones. The Wild symbol comes to the player's aid by substituting for all symbols except the Scatter. Additionally, whenever the Wild appears, some bubbles rise from its mouth and randomly hit one of the four chests above the game grid, which gives us a multiplier between x2 and x5. Also, if the central chest opens, then we will have a chance to win one of the available jackpots: Mini, Minor, Major, and Grand. Furthermore, the Scatter symbol triggers Free Spins, where low-value symbols are removed, and Wilds can continue to give us a multiplier as in the base game.\n\nRTP and volatility\n\nNeptune's Fortune Megaways boasts an RTP value of 96.03% and high volatility. The less frequent wins result in much higher rewards.\n\n        \n            ",

            "prompt": "\n        Below is a review of the game \"Neptune’s Fortune Megaways\".\n\n        Please provide a detailed prompt for DALLE to create a feature image fitting the game\n        \n        - The image should be in cartoon style\n        - The should feature a happy Maya warrior with glasses\n\n        Review: Neptune’s Fortune Megaways\n\nIf we were to rank the most popular themes among slot players, epic stories would definitely be at the top of the list. Neptune's Fortune Megaways is also part of this trend, as the title suggests, with the protagonist being Neptune, lord of the sea and storms, venerated by both the Romans and the Greeks under the name of Poseidon.\n\nAs usual, iSoftBet has done an excellent job graphically, although we must say that the real strength of the slot lies in the bonus system offered. The game grid is located at the bottom of the sea, surrounded by seaweed, corals, and other aquatic plants, with jackpots on the right and the start buttons on the left.\n\nFeatures of Neptune's Fortune Megaways\nIn this slot, the grid has 5 reels, but the rows can vary between 3 and 6. The minimum bet is 20 coins, and we decide the value of each coin. If we opt for the lowest value, which is €0.01, each spin would only cost us €0.20. Like all Megaways slots, there are plenty of ways to win, with 46,656 in total. The slot also offers the option to activate between 5 and 1,000 automatic spins.\n\nThe RTP value is 96.03%, and the volatility is high, so we'll have less frequent wins but much higher rewards.\n\nSymbols and functionality\nAmong the features of Neptune's Fortune Megaways is the cascade function, meaning that after each paying combination, winning symbols explode and are replaced by others.\n\nThe symbols are of low and high value. As usual, the first group includes playing cards from 10 to Ace, while the second group includes thematic icons: the starfish, the shell, the octopus, and Neptune.\n\nThe Wild symbol is an oyster with a pearl inside, substituting for all symbols except the Scatter. Whenever it appears, some bubbles rise from its mouth and randomly hit one of the four chests above the game grid. Most of the time, the chest will open and give us a multiplier between x2 and x5. If the central chest opens, then we will have a chance to win one of the available jackpots:\n\nMini: 20x the bet\nMinor: 50x the bet\nMajor: 200x the bet\nGrand: 1,000x the bet\n\nThe Scatter is Neptune's trident: if it appears four times, we get 10 Free Spins, with five symbols, we are entitled to 12 Free Spins, and with six symbols, the Free Spins are 15.\n\nDuring Free Spins, low-value symbols are removed, and Wilds can continue to give us a multiplier as in the base game. \n\nExperience the thrill of Neptune's Fortune Megaways and dive into an epic underwater adventure where you can win big!\n        ",
