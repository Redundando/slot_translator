Players simply need to hit the “Play” button to set the reels spinning and aim to align identical symbols from left to right.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe slot machine boasts simple yet legible graphics and features symbols that complement the game's overall theme. Symbols players can find alongside Miss Kitty include a Full Moon, Red Fish, Little Bird, a Mouse on wheels, a Milk Carton, a ball of Wool, and the classic Poker letters J, Q, K, and A, alongside numbers 9 and 10. Miss Kitty serves as the Wild Symbol, while the Full Moon is the Scatter Symbol in the game.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe game offers several bonus features that increase players' chances of winning. The Miss Kitty symbol can substitute any other symbol except for the Scatter, while the Full Moon symbol triggers the bonus game when it shows up on any of the reels in a set of three, offering ten Free Spins. During these Free Spins, any symbols depicting Miss Kitty become Sticky Wilds, increasing players' chances of forming more winning combinations. Players can even re-trigger more Free Spins if they catch the Full Moon symbol during the round. The Gamble feature, which allows players to increase their winnings by correctly guessing the colour or suit of a hidden card, is also available.\n\nDesign\n\nMiss Kitty features a charming purple cat and other loveable animals in a vibrant and colourful setting. The backdrop to the slot machine is a dark cityscape awash in moonlight, with the magnificent full moon itself being one of the symbols on the reels. The game boasts simple yet legible graphics, well-crafted symbols, and the right tunes and thrilling sound effects that create the perfect atmosphere for a satisfying gaming experience.\n\nWinning Opportunities\n\nWith up to 50 pay lines, Miss Kitty offers several winning opportunities for seasoned gamblers. The Sticky Wilds feature during the Free Spins round increases players' chances of forming more winning combinations, leading to excellent payouts. Additionally, players can increase their winnings further by correctly guessing the colour or suit of a hidden card in the Gamble feature. Similar slots to Miss Kitty include 50 Lions and 50 Dragons, both from Aristocrat Technologies, which have similar mechanisms to trigger bonus rounds and also offer up to 50 pay lines.\n\n        \n            ",

The game offers Wild and Scatter symbols, with up to ten Free Spins triggered by the Full Moon symbol. Players can reactivate Free Spins during gameplay, and the Gamble feature is available to those interested in doubling or quadrupling their payout. The game is charmingly adorned with cat themes, making it a visual treat for lovers of cats.\n\nGameplay and Mechanics\n\nGamers simply select the desired number of pay lines and bet size, then hit the 'Play' button to start the reels spinning. The Miss Kitty symbol acts as a Wild card, substituting for symbols to form winning combinations that did not hit. With easy-to-understand gameplay and an attractive number of pay lines, Miss Kitty offers a long, satisfying gaming experience.\n\nSymbols and Bonuses\n\nWith each game paying from left to right, the Miss Kitty symbol is one of the most important for gamers to align appropriately, serving as a substitute for missing symbols that would complete an otherwise winning pay line. The Full Moon symbol is another essential symbol that triggers free spins. When three or more of these symbols show up, players are awarded up to ten free spins, and any Miss Kitty symbol that shows up during this round will serve as a Sticky Wild for the duration of the bonus round. This feature is retriggerable, allowing for more free spins and chances of obtaining big payouts.\n\nDesign and Graphics\n\nMiss Kitty boasts of attractive graphics, with a purple cat and other cat-themed symbols on well-crafted reels set against a moonlit cityscape. Players will find the graphics of this game easy on the eyes, making them feel thoroughly engaged in the gameplay experience.\n\nGamble Feature\n\nThe Gamble feature doubles the payout for those who correctly guess the colour of a hidden card. Gamers can even quadruple their payout if they predict the exact suit of the card. This feature makes gamers feel more engaged in gameplay than ever before, as they are willing to go the extra mile to win big payouts.\n\n        \n            ",

The backdrop to the slot machine is a dark cityscape awash in moonlight, with the magnificent full moon itself being one of the symbols on the reels. It is also the key to bonus features in the game. Once you've selected your playing lines and set your betting value, simply hit the \"Play\" button to set the reels spinning and aim to align identical symbols from left to right.\n\nAesthetics of the Slot Machine\n\nLike most other Aristocrat games, Miss Kitty boasts simple yet legible graphics with well-crafted symbols that create the perfect atmosphere for a satisfying gaming experience. Complemented by the right tunes and thrilling sound effects, this game offers riveting gameplay that will keep seasoned gamblers hooked. Alongside adorable Miss Kitty, you will find other cat-themed symbols, including a Full Moon, Red Fish, Little Bird, a Mouse on wheels, a Milk Carton, a ball of Wool, and the classic Poker letters J, Q, K, and A, alongside numbers 9 and 10. Miss Kitty serves as the Wild Symbol, while the Full Moon is the Scatter Symbol in the game.\n\nFunctions and Bonuses\n\nMiss Kitty allows players to activate up to 50 pay lines, with five reels on which four symbols each appear. The Miss Kitty symbol, like a wild card, can sub as any other symbol, except for the Scatter, to complete winning combinations that didn't click. It appears on reels two to five. The Full Moon symbol on the other hand triggers the bonus game when it shows up on any of the reels in a set of three. As a reward, the player receives ten Free Spins. During this exciting round, any symbols featuring Miss Kitty that land on the reels become Sticky Wilds with immediate effect for the entire duration of the Free Spins. This fantastic feature boosts your chances of forming more winning combinations, leading to excellent payouts. Players can even re-trigger more Free Spins if they catch the Full Moon symbol during the round. The Gamble feature is another way to increase your winnings. Players who correctly guess the colour of a hidden card will double their payout, while those who predict the exact suit will quadruple it.\n\nSimilar Slots to Miss Kitty\n\nOther slots that adhere to the play style of Miss Kitty include 50 Lions and 50 Dragons, both from Aristocrat Technologies.
