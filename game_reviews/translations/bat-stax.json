Non è quindi così strano che anche da noi ci si prepari a questa ricorrenza trasformando le case in un set di un film dell’orrore!\nI simboli per eccellenza della notte di Halloween sono i pipistrelli, i gatti neri, i gufi e in generale tutte le creature della notte, senza però dimenticare cappelli e scope da streghe. Ma l’icona più famosa che rende davvero caratteristica questa ricorrenza è senza dubbio Jack O’Lantern, la zucca intagliata a mano al cui interno viene posizionata una candela che fa risplendere i denti e gli occhi.\nBat Stax è un vero proprio tributo a questa festa tanto goliardica quanto sentita, in cui gli assoluti protagonisti sono i pipistrelli. I colori predominanti sono il blu scuro, il nero e il viola, e l’ambientazione è un cimitero di notte immerso nella nebbia. I simboli sono riprodotti con un’ottima grafica in grado di creare un’atmosfera da brividi.\nNella parte bassa della slot troviamo tutte le informazioni relative alla scommessa, le linee attive e il costo della puntata su ogni linea. Una musica suggestiva e animazioni spaventose accompagnano le vincite e i bonus.\nCaratteristiche di Bat Stax\nLa griglia ha 5 rulli e 3 righe su cui si dipanano 20 linee di pagamento fisse. Si può scommettere da un minimo di 1 gettone per linea sino a un massimo di 200, con il valore di ogni gettone che corrisponde a 0,01 €. Ciò vuol dire che si può giocare senza spendere grosse cifre, caratteristica che rende Bat Stax una slot accessibile a tutti.\nPer quel che riguarda l’Autoplay, non c’è un numero predefinito che può essere selezionato, semplicemente si fanno partire i giri automatici e quando si vuole tornare alla modalità manuale si effettua un secondo click sullo stesso pulsante.\nLa volatilità di questa slot è media, si vince abbastanza spesso e sempre cifre di buon livello. Il ritorno teorico al giocatore (RTP) si attesta sul 95,2%.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nPer vincere a Bat Stax è sufficiente allineare 3 simboli adiacenti dal rullo di sinistra verso destra, anche se in alcuni casi possono bastare 2 simboli.\nLe carte da gioco valgono meno di tutti, a seguire troviamo i ragni e i gatti. Salendo un po’ più su troviamo il gufo che ci ricompensa anche con due soli simboli. Il simbolo regolare dal valore più alto è il pipistrello, mentre tra quelli speciali a pagare di più è il cappello da strega che tra l’altro ricopre anche la funzione di Wild. La sua particolarità è di sostituire tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter, qui rappresentato dalla zucca di Halloween con la scritta Bonus. In base al numero di Scatter, verremo ricompensati come segue:\n\n3 Scatter ci regalano 10 giri gratuiti\n4 Scatter ci regalano 15 giri gratuiti\n5 Scatter ci regalano 25 giri gratuiti\n\nDurante i Free Spins sono sufficienti 2 soli pipistrelli per vincere.\nUn pipistrello con la luna sullo sfondo può poi apparire associato ai simboli. In base al numero di simboli associati, vedremo il rullo riempirsi di pipistrelli determinando una grande vincita. Ad esempio, due simboli pipistrello associati riempiranno i primi due rulli con lo stesso simbolo, 3 riempiranno i primi 3 rulli e così via, sino ad avere la griglia completa con 5 simboli e una montagna di soldi in regalo!\n",

            "response": "Bat Stax – A tribute to Halloween and the creatures of the night.\n\nHalloween is a holiday that has truly taken over not only America but also Western countries including Italy. It's no surprise that we prepare for this occasion by turning our homes into a horror movie set! The symbols synonymous with Halloween are bats, black cats, owls and other creatures of the night, not forgetting the iconic witch hats and broomsticks. However, the most famous icon of this holiday is undoubtedly Jack O'Lantern, the carved pumpkin with a candle inside that lights up its eyes and teeth.\n\nBat Stax pays tribute to this playful yet meaningful festival, with bats taking center stage. The predominant colors are dark blue, black and purple, creating a chilling atmosphere in a foggy cemetery at night. The symbols are expertly rendered using great graphics that create a spine-tingling feeling. \n\nAt the bottom of the slot, you can find all the information about the bet, active paylines, and the cost of each bet per line. An eerie soundtrack and scary animations accompany the wins and bonuses.\n\nFeatures of Bat Stax\n\nThe game grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 20 fixed paylines. You can place a bet as low as 1 coin per line up to a maximum of 200 coins, with each coin's value being 0.01 €. This means that Bat Stax is accessible to all, regardless of budget.\n\nIn terms of Autoplay, there is no predetermined number of spins that can be selected. Simply start the automatic spins, and when you want to switch back to manual, click the same button again.\n\nBat Stax has a medium volatility, with frequent wins of decent amounts. The theoretical return to the player (RTP) is set at 95.2%.\n\nSymbols and features\n\nTo win at Bat Stax, you need to align 3 adjacent symbols from the leftmost reel to the right, although in some cases, only 2 symbols are enough.\n\nThe playing cards are worth the least, followed by spiders and cats. The owl pays a little more even with just two symbols. The regular symbol with the highest value is the bat, while the special symbol that pays the most is the witch hat, which also acts as the Wild symbol. Its uniqueness lies in replacing all symbols except the Scatter, represented by the Halloween pumpkin with the word Bonus. Depending on the number of Scatters, you will be rewarded as follows:\n\n- 3 Scatters reward 10 free spins\n- 4 Scatters reward 15 free spins\n- 5 Scatters reward 25 free spins\n\nDuring Free Spins, two bats are enough to win.\n\nA bat with the moon in the background may also appear associated with other symbols. Depending on the number of associated symbols, the reel will fill with bats, leading to a big win. For example, two bat symbols associated will fill the first two reels with the same symbol. Three will fill the first three reels, and so on, until the entire grid is filled with 5 symbols and a mountain of money as a reward!",

However, the most famous icon that truly characterizes this celebration is undoubtedly Jack O'Lantern, the hand-carved pumpkin in which a candle is placed, making his teeth and eyes glow.\nBat Stax is a true tribute to this playful yet heartfelt celebration, in which the absolute protagonists are bats. The predominant colors are dark blue, black, and purple, and the setting is a foggy cemetery at night. The symbols are reproduced with excellent graphics that create a chilling atmosphere.\nAt the bottom of the slot, we find all the information related to the bet, active lines, and the cost of the bet on each line. Eerie music and scary animations accompany the winnings and bonuses.\nFeatures of Bat Stax\nThe grid has 5 reels and 3 rows on which 20 fixed pay lines unfold. You can bet from a minimum of 1 token per line up to a maximum of 200, with each token's value corresponding to €0.01. This means that you can play without spending large amounts of money, making Bat Stax a slot accessible to everyone.\nAs for Autoplay, there is no predefined number that can be selected.

Going up a bit more, we find the owl, which rewards us even with just two symbols.

Depending on the number of Scatters, we will be rewarded as follows:\n\n3 Scatters give us 10 free spins\n4 Scatters give us 15 free spins\n5 Scatters give us 25 free spins\n\nDuring Free Spins, only 2 bats are enough to win.\nA bat with the moon in the background can then appear associated with the symbols. Based on the number of associated symbols, we will see the reel fill up with bats, determined by a big win. For example, two bat symbols associated will fill the first two reels with the same symbol, 3 will fill the first 3 reels, and so on, up to having the grid full of 5 symbols and a mountain of money as a gift!\n            ",

The Autoplay feature doesn't have a predefined number that can be selected. The slot has a medium volatility level, and the theoretical RTP is 95.2%. The betting range goes from a minimum of 1 token per line up to a maximum of 200 tokens, with each token's value corresponding to €0.01.\n\nSymbols and paylines\n\nThe symbols in Bat Stax are Halloween-themed. The lowest-paying symbols are playing cards, followed by spiders and cats. The owl rewards us even with just two symbols. The highest regular value symbol is the bat, while among the special ones, there is the witch's hat that covers the Wild function, replacing all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by the Halloween pumpkin with the Bonus inscription. To win, aligning 3 adjacent symbols from the left reel to the right is sufficient, although in some cases, 2 symbols may suffice. The betting range goes from a minimum of 1 token per line up to a maximum of 200 tokens, with each token's value corresponding to €0.01.\n\nBonus features\n\nBat Stax has a Scatter symbol, represented by a Halloween pumpkin with the Bonus inscription. Depending on the number of Scatters, we will get 10, 15, or 25 free spins. During Free Spins, only two bat symbols are enough to win. Additionally, a bat with the moon in the background can appear associated with the symbols, filling the reel with the same bat symbol. Two bats associated will fill the first two reels with the same symbol, 3 will fill the first 3 reels, and so on, up to having the grid full of 5 symbols.\n\nVolatility and RTP\n\nBat Stax has a medium volatility level, which ensures good-level winnings quite frequently throughout the game. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 95.2%, making it an attractive game for many slot enthusiasts.\n\nOverall gaming experience\n\nBat Stax pays homage to Halloween with its dark blue, black, and purple theme and the cemetery setting on a foggy night. The graphics are excellent and create a chilling atmosphere. Eerie music and scary animations accompany the winnings and bonuses, making the overall gaming experience captivating. Additionally, the accessible betting range starting from just one token per line up to 200 tokens makes Bat Stax an attractive game accessible to everyone.\n\n        \n            ",

Therefore, it's not surprising that we also prepare for this event by transforming our homes into a horror movie set!\nThe quintessential symbols of Halloween night are bats, black cats, owls, and all creatures of the night, but not forgetting the witches' hats and brooms. However, the most famous icon that truly characterizes this celebration is undoubtedly Jack O'Lantern, the hand-carved pumpkin in which a candle is placed, making his teeth and eyes glow.\nBat Stax is a true tribute to this playful yet heartfelt celebration, in which the absolute protagonists are bats. The predominant colors are dark blue, black, and purple, and the setting is a foggy cemetery at night. The symbols are reproduced with excellent graphics that create a chilling atmosphere.\nAt the bottom of the slot, we find all the information related to the bet, active lines, and the cost of the bet on each line. Eerie music and scary animations accompany the winnings and bonuses.\nFeatures of Bat Stax\nThe grid has 5 reels and 3 rows on which 20 fixed pay lines unfold. You can bet from a minimum of 1 token per line up to a maximum of 200, with each token's value corresponding to €0.01. This means that you can play without spending large amounts of money, making Bat Stax a slot accessible to everyone.\nAs for Autoplay, there is no predefined number that can be selected. Simply start the automatic spins, and when you want to return to manual mode, click the same button again.\nThe volatility of this slot is medium, with good-level winnings quite frequent. The theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95.2%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nTo win at Bat Stax, you only need to align 3 adjacent symbols from the left reel to the right, although in some cases, 2 symbols may suffice.\nPlaying cards are worth less than all others, followed by spiders and cats. Going up a bit more, we find the owl, which rewards us even with just two symbols. The highest regular value symbol is the bat, while among the special ones that pay the most is the witch's hat, which also covers the function of Wild. Its peculiarity is to replace all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by the Halloween pumpkin with the Bonus inscription. Depending on the number of Scatters, we will be rewarded as follows:\n\n3 Scatters give us 10 free spins\n4 Scatters give us 15 free spins\n5 Scatters give us 25 free spins\n\nDuring Free Spins, only 2 bats are enough to win.\nA bat with the moon in the background can then appear associated with the symbols. Based on the number of associated symbols, we will see the reel fill up with bats, determined by a big win. For example, two bat symbols associated will fill the first two reels with the same symbol, 3 will fill the first 3 reels, and so on, up to having the grid full of 5 symbols and a mountain of money as a gift!\n            ",

Therefore, it's not surprising that we also prepare for this event by transforming our homes into a horror movie set!\nThe quintessential symbols of Halloween night are bats, black cats, owls, and all creatures of the night, but not forgetting the witches' hats and brooms. However, the most famous icon that truly characterizes this celebration is undoubtedly Jack O'Lantern, the hand-carved pumpkin in which a candle is placed, making his teeth and eyes glow.\nBat Stax is a true tribute to this playful yet heartfelt celebration, in which the absolute protagonists are bats. The predominant colors are dark blue, black, and purple, and the setting is a foggy cemetery at night. The symbols are reproduced with excellent graphics that create a chilling atmosphere.\nAt the bottom of the slot, we find all the information related to the bet, active lines, and the cost of the bet on each line. Eerie music and scary animations accompany the winnings and bonuses.\nFeatures of Bat Stax\nThe grid has 5 reels and 3 rows on which 20 fixed pay lines unfold. You can bet from a minimum of 1 token per line up to a maximum of 200, with each token's value corresponding to €0.01. This means that you can play without spending large amounts of money, making Bat Stax a slot accessible to everyone.\nAs for Autoplay, there is no predefined number that can be selected. Simply start the automatic spins, and when you want to return to manual mode, click the same button again.\nThe volatility of this slot is medium, with good-level winnings quite frequent. The theoretical return to the player (RTP) is 95.2%.\nSymbols and Functionality\nTo win at Bat Stax, you only need to align 3 adjacent symbols from the left reel to the right, although in some cases, 2 symbols may suffice.\nPlaying cards are worth less than all others, followed by spiders and cats. Going up a bit more, we find the owl, which rewards us even with just two symbols. The highest regular value symbol is the bat, while among the special ones that pay the most is the witch's hat, which also covers the function of Wild. Its peculiarity is to replace all symbols except the Scatter, represented here by the Halloween pumpkin with the Bonus inscription. Depending on the number of Scatters, we will be rewarded as follows:\n\n3 Scatters give us 10 free spins\n4 Scatters give us 15 free spins\n5 Scatters give us 25 free spins\n\nDuring Free Spins, only 2 bats are enough to win.\nA bat with the moon in the background can then appear associated with the symbols. Based on the number of associated symbols, we will see the reel fill up with bats, determined by a big win. For example, two bat symbols associated will fill the first two reels with the same symbol, 3 will fill the first 3 reels, and so on, up to having the grid full of 5 symbols and a mountain of money as a gift!\n            ",
