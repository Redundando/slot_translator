Tra i simboli tematici abbiamo invece il calamaio, il candelabro e la coppa. La ragazza e l’apprendista del mecenate sono i simboli regolari che pagano di più in assoluto. In Mystic Secrets è presente il simbolo Wild rappresentato dal mecenate e può sostituire tutti i simboli tranne lo Scatter.

In the background there is a castle surrounded by greenery, inside of which is the famous library, and below the game grid, in addition to the menu, you will find the number of paylines and the value of the bet that can be increased or decreased at will through the \"plus\" and \"minus\" symbols. There are also buttons to play in manual mode and to start a series of automatic spins. Around the frame you will find the numbers of the selected paylines. The advice is to select ten of them, the maximum, to have more chances of winning. By clicking on the menu button, you will find the option to activate the risk mode and to access the paytable.\n\nMain features of the slot\nThe game grid is a classic 5X3 and you can select up to 10 paylines. The minimum bet is €0.10, the maximum is €50 per spin. Although the theoretical return to player (RTP) is not very satisfying (93.6%), the volatility is high, so you need to be patient before obtaining winning combinations, although when this happens, the winnings are always substantial.\n\nSymbols and features of Mystic Secrets\nAmong the non-thematic symbols, the playing cards from ten to ace are those that pay the least. Among the thematic symbols we have instead the inkwell, the candelabrum, and the cup. The girl and the scholar of the patron are the regular symbols that pay the most. In Mystic Secrets, there is the Wild symbol represented by the patron, and it can replace all symbols except the Scatter.

The game grid consists of 5 reels and 3 rows, with 10 paylines that can be activated. Players can place bets ranging from €0,10 to €50. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 93.6%, and the volatility is high, which means it may take some time to hit winning combinations, but when they happen, the payouts are significant. There is a Wild symbol that can substitute all other symbols except for the Scatter. The Scatter symbol is a book and can trigger up to 10 free spins, along with the Mystic Bonus. During the free spins, the winnings are multiplied by 3, and players have a chance to earn additional free spins. Mystic Secrets also features the Gamble function, where players can gamble their winnings to potentially double them.\n\nGame Design and Graphics\n\nMystic Secrets has a well-crafted design with a theme that takes place in a medieval library. The game is set against a backdrop of a castle surrounded by lush greenery, and the game symbols include various objects found in a library, such as inkwells and candelabras. The graphics are detailed, and there are some animations related to winning combinations. The game interface is user-friendly, and players can easily adjust the number of paylines, the bet size, and access the paytable and other game settings.\n\nSymbolism and Theme\n\nMystic Secrets is set in a medieval library and features symbols related to books and learning, such as inkwells and candelabras. The game's main character is a patron of the library, and there is also a girl and an apprentice as regular symbols. The Wild symbol is the patron of the library, and the Scatter symbol is represented by a book. The game's overall theme is mystery and secrets, as players have the chance to uncover hidden treasures by spinning the reels.\n\nBetting Options\n\nPlayers can place bets ranging from €0,10 to €50 per spin in Mystic Secrets. The game grid consists of 5 reels and 3 rows, with 10 paylines that can be activated to increase the chances of hitting winning combinations. Players can adjust the number of paylines and the bet size using the buttons in the game interface, and there is also an option to play in manual mode or activate a series of automatic spins.\n\nReturn to Player Percentage and Volatility\n\nMystic Secrets has a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 93.6%, which is lower than the industry average. However, the game's volatility is high, which means players may experience long periods without hitting any winning combinations, but when the wins come, they are usually significant. Overall, Mystic Secrets is a game best suited for players with a lot of patience and who are willing to take risks to potentially hit big payouts.\n\n        \n            ",

The game is produced by Novomatic software and players have the ability to adjust their bet values using the '+' and '-' symbols. The manual and auto spin buttons are available at the bottom of the game grid. The risk mode and paytable options are accessible by clicking the menu button. The game has a relatively low RTP (93.6%) but high volatility.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nMystic Secrets offers both non-themed and themed symbols. The symbols with the lowest payouts are the playing cards from 10 to Ace. The themed symbols include the inkwell, the candelabra and the cup. The girl and the patron's apprentice are the regular symbols with the highest payouts. Mystic Secrets has a Wild symbol represented by the patron, which can substitute for all other symbols except for the Scatter symbol. The Scatter symbol is represented by the book and entitles players to up to 10 Free Spins plus the Mystic Bonus. When the Scatter symbol appears on the reels, it occupies three reels, increasing the possibility of completing many winning combinations.\n\nBonus Features and Free Spins\n\nMystic Secrets offers players an exciting Free Spins bonus feature. When the Scatter symbol appears on the reels, players are entitled to up to 10 Free Spins plus the Mystic Bonus. During the Free Spins, players have the opportunity to multiply their winnings by 3 and can also be awarded additional free spins. The Scatter symbol's expanded presence on the reels increases the likelihood of hitting multiple winning combinations. Mystic Secrets also includes a Gamble function, where players can try to double their winnings after a successful spin. However, players must correctly guess the color of the next card in order to progress to the special game.\n\nGraphics and Animations\n\nMystic Secrets features beautifully designed graphics with intricate details and some animations related to winning combinations. The game is set against the backdrop of a castle surrounded by greenery, with the library of a famous Renaissance scholar located inside. The game grid is well-organized, with the number of active paylines and the value of the bet prominently displayed underneath the menu option. Overall, the graphics and animations of Mystic Secrets are engaging and add to the excitement of the game.\n\nBetting Limits and Volatility\n\nMystic Secrets has a wide range of betting limits, with the minimum bet set at €0.10 and the maximum bet at €50 for a single spin. The game has a relatively low RTP (93.6%) but high volatility, which means that players must be patient before obtaining winning combinations. Although it may take longer to see significant wins, the payouts are substantial when they do occur, making for an exciting and rewarding gaming experience.\n\n        \n            ",

However, with Mystic Secrets, you have the opportunity to recover some of them simply by accessing the library of a famous Renaissance scholar, eager to share with you all the secrets!\n\nMystic Secrets, a slot machine produced by Novomatic software, has a well-crafted graphics full of details, with some animations related to winnings. In the background there is a castle surrounded by greenery, inside of which is located the famous library. Under the game grid, in addition to the menu, you can find the number of paylines, the value of the bet that can be increased or decreased at will through the \"+\" and \"-\" symbols, the button to play in manual mode and the one to start a series of automatic spins. Around the frame, you will find the numbers of the activated game lines. The advice is to select ten, the maximum, to have more chances of obtaining winnings. By clicking on the menu button, you will find the option to activate the risk mode and to access the paytable.\n\nKey features of the slot:\n\nThe game grid is a classic 5X3 and you can select up to 10 paylines. The minimum bet is €0,10, the maximum is €50 for a single spin. Although the theoretical return to player (RTP) is not very satisfying (93.6%), the volatility is high, so you have to be patient before obtaining winning combinations, but when it happens, the numbers are always significant.\n\nSymbols and features of Mystic Secrets:\n\nAmong the non-themed symbols, the playing cards from 10 to Ace are the ones that pay the least. Among the themed symbols, we have the inkwell, the candelabra, and the cup. The girl and the patron's apprentice are the regular symbols that pay the most in absolute terms. In Mystic Secrets, there is the Wild symbol represented by the patron, and it can replace all symbols except for the Scatter. The latter is represented by the book and when it appears on the reels it entitles you up to 10 Free Spins plus the Mystic Bonus. In this case, the image of the Scatter will occupy three reels increasing the possibility of completing many winning combinations. Moreover, during the free spins, the winnings will be multiplied by 3 and there is also the possibility of being awarded additional free spins. If you have enough cold blood, you can try the Gamble function: after a win, by clicking on the appropriate button, you will see a series of covered cards appear at the top and a deck in the center. Next to it, two buttons to choose from: black and red. If the card in the central deck matches the one at the top, you can proceed to the special game, otherwise, you will return to the screen with the reels and resume the regular game.\n        ",
