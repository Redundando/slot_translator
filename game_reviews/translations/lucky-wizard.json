Una cosa che abbiamo notato in questa software house, è la predilezione per i miti e le leggende legati all’Irlanda, e in effetti anche in questa slot machine sono forti i richiami alla tradizione irlandese.\nIl compartimento grafico offre tinte molto accese nella tonalità del verde e dell’oro e un mago che ricorda molto da vicino un Leprecauno accoglie i giocatori nella schermata principale e li conduce attraverso una foresta incantata alla conquista dei premi più alti.\nNel complesso si tratta di un gioco visivamente molto piacevole: i rulli decorati e la foresta sullo sfondo, i fiori, gli alberi e i funghi conferiscono a Lucky Wizard un’aria magica e misteriosa.\nLa Red Tiger Gaming è solita curare molto nel dettaglio il compartimento grafico dei suoi giochi, e anche in questo caso offre un prodotto di alta qualità e decisamente competitivo.\nCaratteristiche generali\nDisponibile sia per computer desktop che per tutti i dispositivi mobili, sia iOS che Android, Lucky Wizard si presenta come una slot machine dalla struttura piuttosto tradizionale: sono presenti 5 rulli e 40 linee di pagamento.\nUna cosa molto interessante di questo gioco è senza dubbio il range di scommessa piuttosto ampio: è infatti possibile giocare su tutte le linee importi che vanno da soli 20 centesimi fino all’importante somma di 500 €. Indubbiamente, puntando una cifra così alta sarebbe possibile mettere le mani su un bel bottino, tuttavia in caso contrario il gioco si esaurirebbe ben presto, per cui consigliamo di scegliere bene l’importo da scommettere!\nIl ritorno teorico al giocatore (return to player o RTP) in Lucky Wizard si attesta su un accettabile 96,14%, non tantissimo ma perfettamente in linea con la maggior parte degli altri giochi di slot.\nSimboli e funzionalità speciali di Lucky Wizard\nLucky Wizard presenta dieci diversi simboli, di cui otto regolari e due speciali. I simboli regolari sono rappresentati innanzitutto dai quattro semi delle carte da gioco, riprodotti come se fossero delle pietre preziose; tra tutti i simboli, questi sono quelli che hanno il valore inferiore. Per cercare di ottenere dei premi un po’più consistenti si deve sperare che sui rulli appaiano i simboli tematici, ossia una stella dorata, un cappello da mago, un libro degli incantesimi e un ferro di cavallo, che offre 400 gettoni per una combinazione di 5 simboli.\nIl primo simbolo speciale è il Wild, rappresentato da un quadrifoglio: ha funzione di jolly e quando compare su tutti i cinque rulli offre un premio di 800 gettoni.\nSe invece sui rulli compare per almeno tre volte il secondo simbolo speciale, ossia quello Bonus, si può accedere a un mini-gioco: seguendo le istruzioni che compariranno sulla schermata si elaborerà un potente incantesimo che permetterà di ottenere il jackpot.\nLucky Wizard non presenta un funzionalità Free Spins ma si può usufruire di diverse funzionalità che vengono attivate casualmente durante il gioco e che aumentano la possibilità di portare a casa dei ricchi premi! Nel complesso si tratta di un gioco abbastanza classico ma che si distingue sul mercato grazie alla grafica di alta qualità e a un gameplay articolato e divertente!\n",

The game is set in an enchanted forest and features bright shades of green and gold. Lucky Wizard has 5 reels, 40 paylines, and is available for desktop computers and mobile devices.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nLucky Wizard has a traditional slot machine structure. Players can bet on all lines with amounts ranging from 20 cents to €500. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is 96.14%, which is acceptable in comparison to other slot games. Lucky Wizard features ten different symbols, including two special symbols. The Wild symbol, represented by a four-leaf clover, functions as a joker and offers a prize of 800 tokens when appearing on all five reels. The Bonus symbol can activate a mini-game, allowing the player to concoct a powerful spell to win the jackpot. Lucky Wizard does not offer a Free Spins feature, but several other features activate randomly during the game and increase the chances of winning.\n\nSymbols and Paylines\n\nLucky Wizard features ten symbols, with the lower value symbols represented by the four suits of playing cards reproduced as gemstones. Thematic symbols include a golden star, a wizard's hat, a spellbook, and a horseshoe that offers 400 tokens for a combination of 5 symbols. Lucky Wizard has 40 paylines, with winning combinations created from left to right on adjacent reels.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nLucky Wizard offers an enchanting gaming experience with its high-quality, visually appealing graphics. The design features a forest backdrop adorned with flowers, trees, and mushrooms, creating a magical and mysterious atmosphere. The reels are decorated with symbols that complement the game's theme, and a wizard who closely resembles a Leprechaun welcomes players on the main screen.\n\nCompatibility and Betting Range\n\nLucky Wizard is available for both desktop computers and mobile devices, on both iOS and Android platforms. Players can bet on all paylines with amounts ranging from 20 cents to a maximum of €500. It is advised that players choose their bets wisely to maximize their chances of winning. The game's betting range makes it a suitable choice for both casual and high-stakes players.\n\n        \n            ",

The game presents a magical and mysterious atmosphere with decorated reels, a forest backdrop, and flora, giving an enchanting feel.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nLucky Wizard is available for both desktop computers and mobile devices, and it has a traditional structure with 5 reels and 40 paylines. One of the exciting aspects of the game is its broad betting range – players can play on all lines with amounts ranging from just 20 cents to the substantial sum of €500. Furthermore, the theoretical return to player (RTP) in Lucky Wizard sits at 96.14%, which is in line with most slot games. It delivers an elaborate and exciting gameplay experience that’s sure to keep the players engaged.\n\nBetting Range\n\nLucky Wizard offers a broad betting range, allowing players to play on all lines with amounts ranging from 20 cents to €500.\n\nSymbols and Special Symbols\n\nLucky Wizard features ten different symbols – eight regular and two special. The regular symbols begin with the four suits of playing cards reproduced as colorful gemstones and the thematic symbols that offer bigger rewards. The special symbols include the Wild and Bonus symbols. The Wild symbol is a four-leaf clover that has the function of a joker and offers a prize of 800 tokens when it appears on all five reels. On the other hand, the Bonus symbol triggers a mini-game where players can concoct a powerful spell that allows them to win the jackpot.\n\nJackpot Mini-game\n\nLucky Wizard offers a jackpot mini-game that is triggered when the Bonus symbol appears on the reels at least three times. The game is essentially a mini-quest that prompts players to follow instructions on the screen and concoct a powerful spell to win the jackpot. The rewards in this mini-game are much more significant than the regular game and offer players a chance to win big.\n\n        \n            ",

One thing we noticed about this software company is their preference for myths and legends related to Ireland, and in fact, this slot machine also features strong references to Irish traditions.\n\nThe graphic compartment offers very bright shades of green and gold and a wizard who closely resembles a Leprechaun welcomes players on the main screen and leads them through an enchanted forest to conquer the highest rewards. Overall, it is a visually pleasing game: the decorated reels and the forest backdrop, flowers, trees, and mushrooms give Lucky Wizard a magical and mysterious atmosphere.\n\nRed Tiger Gaming usually pays great attention to the graphic compartment of its games, and in this case, they offer a high-quality and highly competitive product.\n\nGeneral features\nAvailable for both desktop computers and mobile devices, both iOS and Android, Lucky Wizard is a slot machine with a rather traditional structure: it has 5 reels and 40 paylines.\n\nOne very interesting thing about this game is the rather wide betting range: you can play on all lines with amounts ranging from just 20 cents to the significant sum of €500. Undoubtedly, betting such a high amount would be possible to win a nice prize, however, in case of loss, the game would end quickly, so we advise players to choose their bets wisely!\n\nThe theoretical return to player (RTP) in Lucky Wizard is acceptable at 96.14%, not the highest but perfectly in line with most other slot games.\n\nSymbols and special features of Lucky Wizard\nLucky Wizard features ten different symbols, eight regular and two special. Regular symbols are represented firstly by the four suits of playing cards, reproduced as gemstones; among all the symbols, these have the lower value. To try to get some more substantial prizes, it is necessary to hope that thematic symbols appear on the reels, such as a golden star, a wizard's hat, a spellbook, and a horseshoe that offers 400 tokens for a combination of 5 symbols.\n\nThe first special symbol is the Wild, represented by a four-leaf clover: it has the function of a joker and when it appears on all five reels, it offers a prize of 800 tokens. If instead, the second special symbol, the Bonus symbol, appears on the reels at least three times, you can access a mini-game: by following the instructions that will appear on the screen, players can concoct a powerful spell that allows them to win the jackpot.\n\nLucky Wizard does not present a Free Spins feature, but players can take advantage of several features that are activated randomly during the game and increase the chances of taking home rich prizes! Overall, it is a fairly classic game, but it stands out on the market thanks to its high-quality graphics and an elaborate and entertaining gameplay.\n        ",
