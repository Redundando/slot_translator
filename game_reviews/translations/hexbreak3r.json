Play on five reels with a minimum of 243 ways to win. Lucky horseshoe symbols expand the reels upwards, adding more ways to win and extending to bonus wins at the top of the game.\n\nWatch out for the black cat, as this lucky symbol awards cash prizes or jackpots. A symbol substitution feature transforms symbols, and reels spin during a round of free spins, expanding downwards to reach the bottom.\n\nDiscover the magic of the Hexbreak3r slot machine at the top IGT casinos.\n\nWith 5x3 reels initially, the Hexbreaker 3 slot machine game offers 243 ways to win, but with the possibility of increasing the playing field up to 59,049 ways. This, plus the pay-both-ways system, makes combinations easier to form. Although its potential should be decent, individual payouts are very low, offering a maximum of 15 coins each. Fixed jackpots up to 1,412.5x are also available. \n\nThe relevant features of this game include the wild, stacked bonus symbols, oscillation expansion, a Lucky Zone, symbol substitutions, and free spins. \n\nAn unforgettable magical graphics interface.\n\nThe head of a black cat, with shining eyes, floats to the left of the reels, with control buttons to the right. In this magical-themed slot game, you will see a dark blue background full of mysterious patterns, and crow and voodoo doll symbols on the reels.\n\nAlthough the artwork is relatively simple, it is enlivened by some cute animations, such as energy ribbons rising from the reels and winning symbols dancing around.\n\nWhen playing the Hexbreak3r slot online, it is the unusual reel layout that will catch your eye. You might see only three symbols on each reel, and 243 ways to win, or the reels might contain a variable number of symbols on each. \n\nThe glowing spheres and black cat at the top of each reel are other important elements. Keep reading to see how International Game Technology (IGT) developers add a touch of magic to the game, giving you up to 59,049 ways to win. \n\nThe witch theme is the same as in previous titles, giving us black cats, crows, the number 13, potions, voodoo dolls, and other equally creepy images. Finally, there are various feature symbols in use, such as black cats, horseshoes, bonus logos, as well as low-value royals. The graphics are not impressive, but they do their job and are dark enough to fit the theme.\n\nSlots Machine Functions and Symbols\n\nA symbol transformation feature transforms from one to four symbols into examples of others, although not the wild game logo or bonus icon. Three bonus symbols launch free spins, during which the reels start from 243 ways and extend downwards when the horseshoe appears.\n\nThese continue until the symbols reach a skull at the bottom of the game, and we found that it usually takes 30-40 spins. The symbols appear different, including a white cat, but payouts are the same. \n\nThe central reel of the Hexbreak3r 3 slot machine contains the Luck Zones in base games and a Jinx Zone in free spins. If the central reel expands to one of the two cats, you win jackpots or a coin multiplier between 800 and 5000.\n\nThe game logo will serve as a wild, substituting for regular symbols, which you will only find on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th reels.\n\nIf a Golden Horseshoe were to land on a reel, it would trigger a column expansion on which it sits, adding 1-2 extra positions on top. \n\nThere is a Lucky Zone, where you can get cash prizes, bonus features, or black cats, and you can win up to 5,000 coins. \n\nSymbol substitutions can occur at any time as part of a random event. You can transform up to 4 symbols per reel. \n\nTo activate free spins, you need the Bonus symbol visible on the three central columns, or a Bonus symbol that lands in the Lucky Zone. Reel expansion is triggered via the Golden Horseshoe symbol and occurs for every column where symbols appear. Reels are available for the three central columns, and the paytable symbols change for this feature. \n\nAdditionally, there is a Jinx Zone, which can give bonus symbols with cash prizes, as well as pink cat icons. The spheres that land on you can bring prizes up to 5,000 coins. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines include IGT's Hexbreaker 2 slot online, which has 720 ways to win and a new set of symbols during the free games round. Play WGS Technology's Black Magic slot machine to unleash owls, snakes, and a witch across five reels and 25 lines. It comes with a crystal collection round where you discover big cash prizes.\n            ",

The free spins round expands the reels downwards to reach the bottom, increasing the ways to win. Bonuses are also available for players who find horseshoe symbols or activate the Lucky Zone. Finally, symbol substitutions can occur randomly, allowing up to four symbols to turn into one another.\n\nWitch theme and relevant symbols\n\nThe theme of Hexbreak3r is centered around witches and features relevant symbols, including black cats, horseshoes, bonus logos, and voodoo dolls.  The graphics portray an atmosphere suitable for the eerie witch theme. The game also features low-value royals and other witch-themed symbols like the number thirteen, potions, and crows.\n\nGraphics and animations\n\nHexbreak3r offers an unforgettable magical graphics interface with simple but enlivening animations. The dark blue background is full of mysterious patterns and features a head of a black cat floating to the left side. The winning symbols dance around and energy ribbons rise from the reels after the spins. The graphics provide a good look for the witch theme.\n\nPay-both-ways system\n\nHexbreak3r features a pay-both-ways system that makes it easier to form combinations when playing on five reels. The game initially offers 243 ways to win, and it's possible to increase the reel layout up to 59,049 ways to win, substantially increasing the game's potential. Individual payouts are generally very low, with a maximum payout of only 15 coins each but fixed jackpots up to 1,412.5x are available.\n\nLuck Zones and Jinx Zones\n\nHexbreak3r's central reel has a Lucky Zone in the base game, and during the free spins round, the central reel switches to a Jinx zone. Players can also find horseshoe symbols that trigger a column expansion on which it sits, adding 1-2 extra positions on top, thus providing more ways to win. Additionally, during the free spins round, reels are available for the three central columns, and the paytable symbols change for this feature.\n\nFixed jackpots up to 1,412.5x and similar slot machines\n\nHexbreak3r offers fixed jackpots up to 1,412.5x and is similar to other online slot machines in the witch theme, such as IGT's Hexbreaker 2 slot online, which has 720 ways to win and a new set of symbols during the free games round. Players can also try out WGS Technology's Black Magic slot machine featuring five reels and 25 lines, with owls, snakes, and a witch-themed slot. It comes with a crystal collection round where you can discover massive cash prizes.\n\n        \n            ",

Play on five reels with a minimum of 243 ways to win. Lucky horseshoe symbols expand the reels upwards, adding more ways to win and extending to bonus wins at the top of the game.\n\nWatch out for the black cat, as this lucky symbol awards cash prizes or jackpots. A symbol substitution feature transforms symbols, and reels spin during a round of free spins, expanding downwards to reach the bottom.\n\nDiscover the magic of the Hexbreak3r slot machine at the top IGT casinos.\n\nWith 5x3 reels initially, the Hexbreaker 3 slot machine game offers 243 ways to win, but with the possibility of increasing the playing field up to 59,049 ways. This, plus the pay-both-ways system, makes combinations easier to form. Although its potential should be decent, individual payouts are very low, offering a maximum of 15 coins each. Fixed jackpots up to 1,412.5x are also available. \n\nThe relevant features of this game include the wild, stacked bonus symbols, oscillation expansion, a Lucky Zone, symbol substitutions, and free spins. \n\nAn unforgettable magical graphics interface.\n\nThe head of a black cat, with shining eyes, floats to the left of the reels, with control buttons to the right. In this magical-themed slot game, you will see a dark blue background full of mysterious patterns, and crow and voodoo doll symbols on the reels.\n\nAlthough the artwork is relatively simple, it is enlivened by some cute animations, such as energy ribbons rising from the reels and winning symbols dancing around.\n\nWhen playing the Hexbreak3r slot online, it is the unusual reel layout that will catch your eye. You might see only three symbols on each reel, and 243 ways to win, or the reels might contain a variable number of symbols on each. \n\nThe glowing spheres and black cat at the top of each reel are other important elements. Keep reading to see how International Game Technology (IGT) developers add a touch of magic to the game, giving you up to 59,049 ways to win. \n\nThe witch theme is the same as in previous titles, giving us black cats, crows, the number 13, potions, voodoo dolls, and other equally creepy images. Finally, there are various feature symbols in use, such as black cats, horseshoes, bonus logos, as well as low-value royals. The graphics are not impressive, but they do their job and are dark enough to fit the theme.\n\nSlots Machine Functions and Symbols\n\nA symbol transformation feature transforms from one to four symbols into examples of others, although not the wild game logo or bonus icon. Three bonus symbols launch free spins, during which the reels start from 243 ways and extend downwards when the horseshoe appears.\n\nThese continue until the symbols reach a skull at the bottom of the game, and we found that it usually takes 30-40 spins. The symbols appear different, including a white cat, but payouts are the same. \n\nThe central reel of the Hexbreak3r 3 slot machine contains the Luck Zones in base games and a Jinx Zone in free spins. If the central reel expands to one of the two cats, you win jackpots or a coin multiplier between 800 and 5000.\n\nThe game logo will serve as a wild, substituting for regular symbols, which you will only find on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th reels.\n\nIf a Golden Horseshoe were to land on a reel, it would trigger a column expansion on which it sits, adding 1-2 extra positions on top. \n\nThere is a Lucky Zone, where you can get cash prizes, bonus features, or black cats, and you can win up to 5,000 coins. \n\nSymbol substitutions can occur at any time as part of a random event. You can transform up to 4 symbols per reel. \n\nTo activate free spins, you need the Bonus symbol visible on the three central columns, or a Bonus symbol that lands in the Lucky Zone. Reel expansion is triggered via the Golden Horseshoe symbol and occurs for every column where symbols appear. Reels are available for the three central columns, and the paytable symbols change for this feature. \n\nAdditionally, there is a Jinx Zone, which can give bonus symbols with cash prizes, as well as pink cat icons. The spheres that land on you can bring prizes up to 5,000 coins. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines include IGT's Hexbreaker 2 slot online, which has 720 ways to win and a new set of symbols during the free games round. Play WGS Technology's Black Magic slot machine to unleash owls, snakes, and a witch across five reels and 25 lines. It comes with a crystal collection round where you discover big cash prizes.\n            ",

Play on five reels with a minimum of 243 ways to win. Lucky horseshoe symbols expand the reels upwards, adding more ways to win and extending to bonus wins at the top of the game.\n\nWatch out for the black cat, as this lucky symbol awards cash prizes or jackpots. A symbol substitution feature transforms symbols, and reels spin during a round of free spins, expanding downwards to reach the bottom.\n\nDiscover the magic of the Hexbreak3r slot machine at the top IGT casinos.\n\nWith 5x3 reels initially, the Hexbreaker 3 slot machine game offers 243 ways to win, but with the possibility of increasing the playing field up to 59,049 ways. This, plus the pay-both-ways system, makes combinations easier to form. Although its potential should be decent, individual payouts are very low, offering a maximum of 15 coins each. Fixed jackpots up to 1,412.5x are also available. \n\nThe relevant features of this game include the wild, stacked bonus symbols, oscillation expansion, a Lucky Zone, symbol substitutions, and free spins. \n\nAn unforgettable magical graphics interface.\n\nThe head of a black cat, with shining eyes, floats to the left of the reels, with control buttons to the right. In this magical-themed slot game, you will see a dark blue background full of mysterious patterns, and crow and voodoo doll symbols on the reels.\n\nAlthough the artwork is relatively simple, it is enlivened by some cute animations, such as energy ribbons rising from the reels and winning symbols dancing around.\n\nWhen playing the Hexbreak3r slot online, it is the unusual reel layout that will catch your eye. You might see only three symbols on each reel, and 243 ways to win, or the reels might contain a variable number of symbols on each. \n\nThe glowing spheres and black cat at the top of each reel are other important elements. Keep reading to see how International Game Technology (IGT) developers add a touch of magic to the game, giving you up to 59,049 ways to win. \n\nThe witch theme is the same as in previous titles, giving us black cats, crows, the number 13, potions, voodoo dolls, and other equally creepy images. Finally, there are various feature symbols in use, such as black cats, horseshoes, bonus logos, as well as low-value royals. The graphics are not impressive, but they do their job and are dark enough to fit the theme.\n\nSlots Machine Functions and Symbols\n\nA symbol transformation feature transforms from one to four symbols into examples of others, although not the wild game logo or bonus icon. Three bonus symbols launch free spins, during which the reels start from 243 ways and extend downwards when the horseshoe appears.\n\nThese continue until the symbols reach a skull at the bottom of the game, and we found that it usually takes 30-40 spins. The symbols appear different, including a white cat, but payouts are the same. \n\nThe central reel of the Hexbreak3r 3 slot machine contains the Luck Zones in base games and a Jinx Zone in free spins. If the central reel expands to one of the two cats, you win jackpots or a coin multiplier between 800 and 5000.\n\nThe game logo will serve as a wild, substituting for regular symbols, which you will only find on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th reels.\n\nIf a Golden Horseshoe were to land on a reel, it would trigger a column expansion on which it sits, adding 1-2 extra positions on top. \n\nThere is a Lucky Zone, where you can get cash prizes, bonus features, or black cats, and you can win up to 5,000 coins. \n\nSymbol substitutions can occur at any time as part of a random event. You can transform up to 4 symbols per reel. \n\nTo activate free spins, you need the Bonus symbol visible on the three central columns, or a Bonus symbol that lands in the Lucky Zone. Reel expansion is triggered via the Golden Horseshoe symbol and occurs for every column where symbols appear. Reels are available for the three central columns, and the paytable symbols change for this feature. \n\nAdditionally, there is a Jinx Zone, which can give bonus symbols with cash prizes, as well as pink cat icons. The spheres that land on you can bring prizes up to 5,000 coins. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines include IGT's Hexbreaker 2 slot online, which has 720 ways to win and a new set of symbols during the free games round. Play WGS Technology's Black Magic slot machine to unleash owls, snakes, and a witch across five reels and 25 lines. It comes with a crystal collection round where you discover big cash prizes.\n            ",
