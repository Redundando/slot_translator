With its captivating theme of a dragon ruling over an icy world and a princess holding the reins, players can spin the five reels and five rows for a chance to win on 3125 paylines, which increases with the addition of new rows during the bonus feature. The game offers high variance and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.99%.\n\nPlayable starting from 20 cents per spin on all devices, Dragon Spark comes with cascading reels that increase the win multiplier up to 50x in the base game. The Wild Fire and Fire Blast features trigger collapses, but it's all about the Free Games feature where the Ways Boost engine increases the number of paylines to a maximum of 16,807. The win multiplier keeps increasing, and players have the chance to enjoy infinite free spins. With a maximum win of 10,000x the bet per spin, Dragon Spark has an RTP of 96.99%.\n\nThe graphics are \"flaming\" with numerous video effects and cutscenes. The wild dragon throws its fiery representation onto the reels, engulfing symbols in flames. Huge wins trigger fanfares as the explosion of coins covers the entire screen. The epic background music adds cinematic quality to the reel adventure, making it a treat for experienced gamblers.\n\nThe symbols on the reels include low-value gemstones, as well as dragon rings, potions, daggers, crowns, and the Dragon Queen. The Dragon Queen is the most rewarding symbol, giving players 3x their bet for a combination of five. The golden dragon is the wild symbol and substitutes for any other symbol except the bonus symbols and bomb, triggering a bonus feature whenever it lands on the second, third, fourth, or fifth reels (more details below).\n\nDragon Spark is a portrait-first slot game designed using HTML5 technology that allows it to be played on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. All controls and buttons are at the bottom of the screen, including the Ways Boost indicator, which marks the payout mechanism style as implemented by Playtech Origins.\n\nTo spin the reels, press the play button located below the fifth reel. To the left of it are two buttons, autoplay, and turbo mode. Turbo mode makes the reels spin faster for a more dynamic gameplay than usual. Betting is quick and easy – select the amount by pressing the plus and minus buttons on the bottom left of the reel set. Dragon Spark offers a wide range of bets, starting from 20 cents per spin. The maximum bet is a high-stakes adventure that should be off-limits for most players.\n\nDragon Spark can be played in autoplay mode, which offers several preset options that spin the reels automatically, deducting the bet once for each spin.\n\nThe wins in this game are achieved through the cascading or avalanche system. A minimum of three symbols is required for a win, while four and five-winning symbols are rarer but pay more substantial rewards. When a winning combination occurs, the symbols disappear, and their spots are filled with new symbols. Dragon Spark slot has a wild symbol that can replace any of the standard symbols.\n\nThe Princess is the most lucrative win, especially when players match five of her symbols. However, this will not yield more than 10x since cascading wins can cause multiple wins from the same bet.\n\nDragon Spark features a total of five bonus features, including a reel engine that brings a win multiplier of up to 50x. The Wild Fire and Fire Blast features remove symbols from the reels for collapses and win multiplier increases. The Free Games feature is where the number of paylines increases up to 16,807, and the win multiplier only keeps growing.\n\nFor other similar slot games, players can try Quickspin's first jackpot game, Dragon Chase, with 20 paylines on three rows and five reels.

The payouts are made on adjacent reels with at least three symbols of the same type. The game has high variance and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.99%.\n\nPlayable from 20 cents per spin on all devices, it comes with cascading reels that increase the win multiplier up to 50x in the base game. With the Wild Fire and Fire Blast features that give you collapses, it's all about the Free Games feature where the Ways Boost engine increases the number of ways to win up to 16,807. The win multiplier only keeps increasing, and there's a chance to make infinite free spins. It has an RTP of 96.99% and a maximum payout of 10,000x per spin.\n\nA Flaming Visual Design\nThe graphics of this slot are exactly what you'd expect from Playtech Origins. The theme is a frozen world ruled by a dragon and a princess who holds the reins. The symbols correspond to the theme. The less lucrative symbols are composed of various gems, while the more paying ones are composed of a crown, a dragon ring, a dagger, and the princess.\n\nThe Dragon Spark slot is visually stunning, as there are multiple video effects and cutscenes. The wild dragon throws its fiery effect on the reel, engulfing the symbols in flames. Big wins are celebrated in many fanfares, as the explosion of coins covers the entire screen. The background music is an epic theme that has cinematic quality, completing this reel adventure.\n\nThe Dragon Spark slot is beautifully designed and has a dragon-themed theme. Set inside the dragon's lair, it has a touch of Game of Thrones visually. With a dramatic soundtrack, the graphics are crystal clear and high definition.\n\nThe symbols on the reels include low-value gems. You'll also come across daggers, potion bottles, dragon rings, crowns, and the Dragon Queen. The symbol of the Dragon Queen is the most profitable, giving you 3x your bet for 5 in a combination.\n\nThe symbol of the golden dragon is wild and replaces any other symbol except the bonus and bomb symbols. It appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, triggering a bonus feature each time it lands (more details below).\n\nPlaytech created the Dragon Spark slot with HTML5 technology, which means it can be played on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. In fact, Playtech designed Dragon Spark as Portrait First, meaning it focused on players using smartphones.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe production studio has included all the controls and buttons at the bottom of the screen. The Ways Boost indicator is located in the bottom right corner of the screen to mark the style of the cascading payout mechanism as realized according to Playtech Origins.\n\nTo start spinning the reels, press the play button located below the fifth reel. To the left of it, there are two buttons, one is autoplay and the other is the Turbo mode, which makes the reels spin and stop faster, for a more dynamic gameplay than usual.\n\nChoosing the bet size is a quick operation. Select the amount by pressing the minus and plus buttons on the bottom left of the reel set. The Dragon Spark slot offers a wide range of bets, as players can start spinning with a minimum of 20 cents per spin. The maximum bet is a high-stakes adventure that should be off-limits for most players.\n\nDragon Spark can be played in its automatic spin mode. Pressing the Autoplay button opens a series of presets that make the reels spin on their own for many cycles, deducting the bet amount once for each spin.\n\nWinning results in this game are achieved with the cascade or avalanche falling system. At least three symbols are needed to trigger a win, while four and five winning symbols are rarer but pay out more consistent prizes.\n\nWhen there is a winning outcome, the symbols disappear, and their positions are filled by a new drop of symbols. Dragon Spark slot has a wild symbol that can replace any of the standard symbols.\n\nThe Princess is the most lucrative win, especially with five of the same, however, this will not bring in more than 10x as cascading wins can cause multiple wins from the same bet.\n\nThe Dragon Spark slot has a total of 5 bonus features. This includes a reel engine that brings a win multiplier into play up to 50x. There are also the Wild Fire and Fire Blast features that remove symbols from the reels to cause collapses and multiplier increases. It's all about the Free Games feature, where the number of ways increases up to 16,807, and the multiplier only goes up.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nPlay the first Quickspin jackpot with a jackpot prize of € 55,001.02. Dragon Chase has 20 paylines that play on three rows and five reels. There's a free bonus feature of spins triggered by landing three scatters, and the theoretical return to player is set at 96.39%.\n            ",

Oh well, a girl can dream.</p><p>What's more, this feature triggers a win multiplier, which starts at 1x and can go up to 50x in the base game. That's right, folks - the more you win, the more you win again! It's like being in a never-ending cycle of winning, just like in my daily routine of checking social media feeds.</p><p>But don't just take our word for it. Take this fire-breathing slot for a spin and see for yourself how the cascading reels take the gameplay to the next level. And who knows, with a little bit of luck, you might be heating up your bank account more than your morning coffee.</p>\"\n}"

(4 bullet points)\n- Bullet lists briefly covering the topic \"What we don't like\". (2 bullet pints)\n- SEO optimized meta title with a maximum length of 45 characters. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\". Capitalize according to AP rules.\n- SEO optimized, neutral meta description, explaining the review with a maximum length of 20 words. Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics and features\n\nDragon Spark is a slot game with five reels and five rows that can spin in 3125 ways to win, expanding with new rows added during the bonus feature. Payouts are made on adjacent reels with at least three symbols of the same type. It has high variance and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.99%. The cascading reels with increasing win multiplier up to 50x and the Wild Fire and Fire Blast features which cause collapses and multiplier increases are supplemented by the Ways Boost engine, along with the Free Games feature, allowing an increase in the number of ways to win up to 16,807. There's also a possibility to make infinite free spins, and it has a maximum payout of 10,000x.\n\nGraphics and sound design\n\nThe visuals of Dragon Spark fully captivate you with its dragon-themed slot design set inside the dragon's lair and epic cinematic sound effects. The graphics are high-quality with multiple video effects that perfectly match the scene. The background music has a cinematic quality that makes the game feel like an adventure. The reels comprise low-value gems, bottles of potions, daggers, dragon rings, crowns, and the Dragon Queen symbol, which pays 3x your bet for a combination of five.\n\nNumber of ways to win\n\nDragon Spark has 3125 ways to win, which increase with new rows added during the bonus feature. Players can start spinning with a minimum of 20 cents per spin and choose from a wide range of bets. Having at least three symbols of the same type on adjacent reels triggers a payout, while four and five winning symbols offer more consistent prizes, returning a high variance. The highest payout is 10,000x per spin.\n\nVariance and Return to Player percentage\n\nWith a theoretical return to player rate of 96.99%, Dragon Spark has a high variance with a maximum payout of 10,000x per spin. As there are many bonus features, including a win multiplier, cascading reels, and Free Games with an increase in the number of ways to win up to 16,807, it's easy to understand why this game has a high variance.\n\nCompatibility with different devices\n\nPlaytech developed Dragon Spark with HTML5 technology to make it playable on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. The game is Portrait First oriented, making it convenient for players who prefer playing on their smartphones. Features, graphics, and sound design of this game are consistent on all devices.\n\nCascading reels feature\n\nDragon Spark has cascading reels, and when there is a winning outcome, the symbols disappear, and their positions are filled by new symbols, resulting in multiple wins from one spin. Winning combinations trigger the win multiplier, which starts at 1x and increases up to 50x in the base game.\n\nFree Games feature\n\nThe slot has a free games feature that triggers when three or four bomb symbols land on the reels, rewarding players with eight or fifteen free spins, respectively. The Ways Boost engine increases the number of ways to win to a maximum of 16,807. The win multiplier only increases and does not reset in this feature, with an infinite possibility of spins available.\n\nWild Fire and Fire Blast features\n\nDragon Spark has two bonus features triggered by the golden dragon wild symbol that appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and replaces any other symbol, except the bonus and bomb symbols. The Wild Fire feature removes two or three symbols from the reels randomly, and the Fire Blast feature removes one complete reel to prepare for a new cascading round, causing a multiplier increase.\n\n        \n            ",

The payouts are made on adjacent reels with at least three symbols of the same type. The game has high variance and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.99%.\n\nPlayable from 20 cents per spin on all devices, it comes with cascading reels that increase the win multiplier up to 50x in the base game. With the Wild Fire and Fire Blast features that give you collapses, it's all about the Free Games feature where the Ways Boost engine increases the number of ways to win up to 16,807. The win multiplier only keeps increasing, and there's a chance to make infinite free spins. It has an RTP of 96.99% and a maximum payout of 10,000x per spin.\n\nA Flaming Visual Design\nThe graphics of this slot are exactly what you'd expect from Playtech Origins. The theme is a frozen world ruled by a dragon and a princess who holds the reins. The symbols correspond to the theme. The less lucrative symbols are composed of various gems, while the more paying ones are composed of a crown, a dragon ring, a dagger, and the princess.\n\nThe Dragon Spark slot is visually stunning, as there are multiple video effects and cutscenes. The wild dragon throws its fiery effect on the reel, engulfing the symbols in flames. Big wins are celebrated in many fanfares, as the explosion of coins covers the entire screen. The background music is an epic theme that has cinematic quality, completing this reel adventure.\n\nThe Dragon Spark slot is beautifully designed and has a dragon-themed theme. Set inside the dragon's lair, it has a touch of Game of Thrones visually. With a dramatic soundtrack, the graphics are crystal clear and high definition.\n\nThe symbols on the reels include low-value gems. You'll also come across daggers, potion bottles, dragon rings, crowns, and the Dragon Queen. The symbol of the Dragon Queen is the most profitable, giving you 3x your bet for 5 in a combination.\n\nThe symbol of the golden dragon is wild and replaces any other symbol except the bonus and bomb symbols. It appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, triggering a bonus feature each time it lands (more details below).\n\nPlaytech created the Dragon Spark slot with HTML5 technology, which means it can be played on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. In fact, Playtech designed Dragon Spark as Portrait First, meaning it focused on players using smartphones.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe production studio has included all the controls and buttons at the bottom of the screen. The Ways Boost indicator is located in the bottom right corner of the screen to mark the style of the cascading payout mechanism as realized according to Playtech Origins.\n\nTo start spinning the reels, press the play button located below the fifth reel. To the left of it, there are two buttons, one is autoplay and the other is the Turbo mode, which makes the reels spin and stop faster, for a more dynamic gameplay than usual.\n\nChoosing the bet size is a quick operation. Select the amount by pressing the minus and plus buttons on the bottom left of the reel set. The Dragon Spark slot offers a wide range of bets, as players can start spinning with a minimum of 20 cents per spin. The maximum bet is a high-stakes adventure that should be off-limits for most players.\n\nDragon Spark can be played in its automatic spin mode. Pressing the Autoplay button opens a series of presets that make the reels spin on their own for many cycles, deducting the bet amount once for each spin.\n\nWinning results in this game are achieved with the cascade or avalanche falling system. At least three symbols are needed to trigger a win, while four and five winning symbols are rarer but pay out more consistent prizes.\n\nWhen there is a winning outcome, the symbols disappear, and their positions are filled by a new drop of symbols. Dragon Spark slot has a wild symbol that can replace any of the standard symbols.\n\nThe Princess is the most lucrative win, especially with five of the same, however, this will not bring in more than 10x as cascading wins can cause multiple wins from the same bet.\n\nThe Dragon Spark slot has a total of 5 bonus features. This includes a reel engine that brings a win multiplier into play up to 50x. There are also the Wild Fire and Fire Blast features that remove symbols from the reels to cause collapses and multiplier increases. It's all about the Free Games feature, where the number of ways increases up to 16,807, and the multiplier only goes up.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nPlay the first Quickspin jackpot with a jackpot prize of € 55,001.02. Dragon Chase has 20 paylines that play on three rows and five reels. There's a free bonus feature of spins triggered by landing three scatters, and the theoretical return to player is set at 96.39%.\n            ",

The payouts are made on adjacent reels with at least three symbols of the same type. The game has high variance and a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.99%.\n\nPlayable from 20 cents per spin on all devices, it comes with cascading reels that increase the win multiplier up to 50x in the base game. With the Wild Fire and Fire Blast features that give you collapses, it's all about the Free Games feature where the Ways Boost engine increases the number of ways to win up to 16,807. The win multiplier only keeps increasing, and there's a chance to make infinite free spins. It has an RTP of 96.99% and a maximum payout of 10,000x per spin.\n\nA Flaming Visual Design\nThe graphics of this slot are exactly what you'd expect from Playtech Origins. The theme is a frozen world ruled by a dragon and a princess who holds the reins. The symbols correspond to the theme. The less lucrative symbols are composed of various gems, while the more paying ones are composed of a crown, a dragon ring, a dagger, and the princess.\n\nThe Dragon Spark slot is visually stunning, as there are multiple video effects and cutscenes. The wild dragon throws its fiery effect on the reel, engulfing the symbols in flames. Big wins are celebrated in many fanfares, as the explosion of coins covers the entire screen. The background music is an epic theme that has cinematic quality, completing this reel adventure.\n\nThe Dragon Spark slot is beautifully designed and has a dragon-themed theme. Set inside the dragon's lair, it has a touch of Game of Thrones visually. With a dramatic soundtrack, the graphics are crystal clear and high definition.\n\nThe symbols on the reels include low-value gems. You'll also come across daggers, potion bottles, dragon rings, crowns, and the Dragon Queen. The symbol of the Dragon Queen is the most profitable, giving you 3x your bet for 5 in a combination.\n\nThe symbol of the golden dragon is wild and replaces any other symbol except the bonus and bomb symbols. It appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5, triggering a bonus feature each time it lands (more details below).\n\nPlaytech created the Dragon Spark slot with HTML5 technology, which means it can be played on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. In fact, Playtech designed Dragon Spark as Portrait First, meaning it focused on players using smartphones.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe production studio has included all the controls and buttons at the bottom of the screen. The Ways Boost indicator is located in the bottom right corner of the screen to mark the style of the cascading payout mechanism as realized according to Playtech Origins.\n\nTo start spinning the reels, press the play button located below the fifth reel. To the left of it, there are two buttons, one is autoplay and the other is the Turbo mode, which makes the reels spin and stop faster, for a more dynamic gameplay than usual.\n\nChoosing the bet size is a quick operation. Select the amount by pressing the minus and plus buttons on the bottom left of the reel set. The Dragon Spark slot offers a wide range of bets, as players can start spinning with a minimum of 20 cents per spin. The maximum bet is a high-stakes adventure that should be off-limits for most players.\n\nDragon Spark can be played in its automatic spin mode. Pressing the Autoplay button opens a series of presets that make the reels spin on their own for many cycles, deducting the bet amount once for each spin.\n\nWinning results in this game are achieved with the cascade or avalanche falling system. At least three symbols are needed to trigger a win, while four and five winning symbols are rarer but pay out more consistent prizes.\n\nWhen there is a winning outcome, the symbols disappear, and their positions are filled by a new drop of symbols. Dragon Spark slot has a wild symbol that can replace any of the standard symbols.\n\nThe Princess is the most lucrative win, especially with five of the same, however, this will not bring in more than 10x as cascading wins can cause multiple wins from the same bet.\n\nThe Dragon Spark slot has a total of 5 bonus features. This includes a reel engine that brings a win multiplier into play up to 50x. There are also the Wild Fire and Fire Blast features that remove symbols from the reels to cause collapses and multiplier increases. It's all about the Free Games feature, where the number of ways increases up to 16,807, and the multiplier only goes up.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nPlay the first Quickspin jackpot with a jackpot prize of € 55,001.02. Dragon Chase has 20 paylines that play on three rows and five reels. There's a free bonus feature of spins triggered by landing three scatters, and the theoretical return to player is set at 96.39%.\n            ",
