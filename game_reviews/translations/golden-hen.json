With a minimum bet of 0.25 up to a maximum of 250.00, this exciting and action-packed NextGen Gaming slot provides non-stop entertainment for players of all budgets.\n\nNextGen Gaming is renowned for its unique slot games, and Golden Hen is no exception. This game features a farm setting complete with a chicken coop full of chickens. With five reels and up to 243 ways to win on every spin, plus wild and scatter cards, regular free spins, and the chance to strike it rich finding the elusive golden rooster with Uncle Tobias.\n\nA graphic design that animal lovers will adore.\n\nThe game creates a countryside feel that perfectly suits the farm theme. The background of the game is a farm field with a forest in the distance. The reels are vibrant blue while the icons above them are bright and cartoonish. Some of the symbols include chicks, eggs with legs popping out, grown chickens and the chicken coop. There are also typical poker icons like King and Queen that add to the country farm feel.\n\nGolden Hen is a typical 5-reel online slot game with 243 paylines up for grabs. Paylines are fixed, which means that you have to play all of them on every spin, but this also means more opportunities to win. The game design is based on a farm, with the reels fenced in a waiting cornfield, the sky is blue and the fields are green - a typical agricultural scene.\n\nAll game symbols are positioned on the real blue and include the golden hen, standard hen, feathered dreamcatcher, dawn chicken, farm, chicken, chick, egg, and card values 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A.\n\nSlot machine features and symbols.\n\nThe wild symbol in Golden Hen is the rooster, but there's a twist - this icon will only appear on the second, third, and fourth reels of the board. In another unique feature, the rooster can replace any single icon on the board, including the scatter symbol. This is a rarely seen characteristic and increases the potential for a big spin and a hefty payout.\n\nTalking about the scatter symbol, this is another feature that stands out with the golden hen. It looks like a circle with a feather hanging on the side and only appears on the three central reels. A scatter win will multiply your winnings by a decent amount of coins. If you are playing a free spin, the wild and scatter combine into a single icon. They will still appear on the three central reels and replace every other symbol on the board. Get three or more scatters, and ten free games are yours. Five of them win in a free game and also result in a 5x multiplier.\n\nNextGen Gaming's Golden Hen slot machine may lack features, particularly if there are no bonus rounds, but the free spins feature is what makes all the difference.\n\nTriggering free spins in this medium variance slot game gives you even more chances to win, thanks to the two sets of wilds on the reels. Moreover, suppose you are fortunate enough to hit a 5 of a kind win in the five payline type. In that case, it will be multiplied by five.\n\nThe game design is almost cartoonish and looks like an old-fashioned Warner Bros animation - we expected the chicken to jump out and run through the screen. When you win, the symbols come to life and almost jump off the reels. The Golden Hen slot machine has a return-to-player (RTP) percentage of 97.22%.\n\nThe standard hen is the wild and only appears on reels 2, 3, and 4. The wild has the power to change into any other symbol on the reels (except scatter) to help boost your bankroll by completing winning paylines.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines.\n\nDolphin Reef is a rather eye-catching slot game for sea enthusiasts. The gorgeous graphics depict numerous sea creatures, from clownfish to turtles, seahorses, and starfish. These are beautifully rendered, although there is a lot of empty space on the screen.

In another unique feature, the rooster can substitute for any single icon on the board, which includes the scatter symbol! This is truly rare and increases the potential for a big spin and a heavy payout.\nSpeaking of the scatter symbol, this is another feature that stands out with the golden chicken. It looks like a circle with a feather hanging on the side, and arrives only on the three middle reels. Winning on the scatter will multiply your winnings by a decent amount of coins. If you're playing a free spin, both the wild and the scatter are combined into a single icon. They will still appear on the three middle reels and replace any other symbol on the board. Getting three or more scatters or wilds will give you ten free games. Five of them win in a free game and also lead to a 5x multiplier.\nAlthough lacking in features such as a bonus round, the free spin feature is what sets this NextGen Gaming slot machine apart.\nBy triggering free spins in this medium-variance slot game, you'll have even more chances to win, thanks to the two sets of wilds on the reels. And if you're lucky enough to hit a 5 of a kind on a payline, it will be multiplied by five.\nThe game's slot machine design is almost cartoonish and resembles a retro animation from Warner Bros - we half expected the chicken to jump out and run across the screen.

The Golden Hen slot machine has a return to player (RTP) percentage of 97.22%.\nThe standard hen is the wild and only appears on reels 2, 3, and 4.

With wilds, scatters, free spins and a non-progressive jackpot of 2,000 coins up for grabs, you'll feel like you've stepped onto a farm when you play Golden Hen. Get your hands dirty as you explore the different ways to win under the reels. Spin the reels for as little as 0.25 up to a maximum of 250.00, ensuring that this action-packed slot game from NextGen Gaming is accessible to every budget.\nAs experienced gamblers know, Next Gen Gaming is known for its unique slot games, and Golden Hen is no exception. With a farmyard setting complete with a chicken coop full of hens, this game offers five reels and up to 243 ways to win on each spin. Featuring both wild and scatter symbols, this game also offers regular free spins. Join Uncle Tobias on the farm and strike it big by finding the elusive golden rooster.\nThe game has an animal lover feel to it, with the background of the game situated in a farm field with a forest in the distance. The reel backgrounds are a vibrant blue, while the icons above them are bright and comic-like. The symbols on the reels include chicks, eggs with legs poking out, grown chickens and the chicken coop. There are also typical poker icons like the king and queen, with nails sticking out and adding to the feel of the farm.\nGolden Hen is a classic online slot game with five reels, but there are 243 paylines on offer. The paylines are fixed, meaning you must play all of them on each spin, but this also means you have even more chances to win. The game's design is inspired by a farm, with the reels being fenced in a cornfield waiting to be harvested, the sky is blue and the fields are green, giving it a typical rural setting.\nAll of the game's symbols are positioned on the real blue reels and include the golden hen, standard hen, feathered dreamcatcher, chicken at dawn, farm, chicken, chick, egg, and card values 9, 10, J, Q, K and A.\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe wild symbol in Golden Hen is the rooster, but there's a twist: this icon will only appear on the second, third and fourth reels of the board. In another unique feature, the rooster can substitute for any single icon on the board, which includes the scatter symbol! This is truly rare and increases the potential for a big spin and a heavy payout.\nSpeaking of the scatter symbol, this is another feature that stands out with the golden chicken. It looks like a circle with a feather hanging on the side, and arrives only on the three middle reels. Winning on the scatter will multiply your winnings by a decent amount of coins. If you're playing a free spin, both the wild and the scatter are combined into a single icon. They will still appear on the three middle reels and replace any other symbol on the board. Getting three or more scatters or wilds will give you ten free games. Five of them win in a free game and also lead to a 5x multiplier.\nAlthough lacking in features such as a bonus round, the free spin feature is what sets this NextGen Gaming slot machine apart.\nBy triggering free spins in this medium-variance slot game, you'll have even more chances to win, thanks to the two sets of wilds on the reels.

With wilds, scatters, free spins and a non-progressive jackpot of 2,000 coins up for grabs, you'll feel like you've stepped onto a farm when you play Golden Hen. Get your hands dirty as you explore the different ways to win under the reels. Spin the reels for as little as 0.25 up to a maximum of 250.00, ensuring that this action-packed slot game from NextGen Gaming is accessible to every budget.\nAs experienced gamblers know, Next Gen Gaming is known for its unique slot games, and Golden Hen is no exception. With a farmyard setting complete with a chicken coop full of hens, this game offers five reels and up to 243 ways to win on each spin. Featuring both wild and scatter symbols, this game also offers regular free spins. Join Uncle Tobias on the farm and strike it big by finding the elusive golden rooster.\nThe game has an animal lover feel to it, with the background of the game situated in a farm field with a forest in the distance. The reel backgrounds are a vibrant blue, while the icons above them are bright and comic-like. The symbols on the reels include chicks, eggs with legs poking out, grown chickens and the chicken coop. There are also typical poker icons like the king and queen, with nails sticking out and adding to the feel of the farm.\nGolden Hen is a classic online slot game with five reels, but there are 243 paylines on offer. The paylines are fixed, meaning you must play all of them on each spin, but this also means you have even more chances to win. The game's design is inspired by a farm, with the reels being fenced in a cornfield waiting to be harvested, the sky is blue and the fields are green, giving it a typical rural setting.\nAll of the game's symbols are positioned on the real blue reels and include the golden hen, standard hen, feathered dreamcatcher, chicken at dawn, farm, chicken, chick, egg, and card values 9, 10, J, Q, K and A.\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe wild symbol in Golden Hen is the rooster, but there's a twist: this icon will only appear on the second, third and fourth reels of the board. In another unique feature, the rooster can substitute for any single icon on the board, which includes the scatter symbol! This is truly rare and increases the potential for a big spin and a heavy payout.\nSpeaking of the scatter symbol, this is another feature that stands out with the golden chicken. It looks like a circle with a feather hanging on the side, and arrives only on the three middle reels. Winning on the scatter will multiply your winnings by a decent amount of coins. If you're playing a free spin, both the wild and the scatter are combined into a single icon. They will still appear on the three middle reels and replace any other symbol on the board. Getting three or more scatters or wilds will give you ten free games. Five of them win in a free game and also lead to a 5x multiplier.\nAlthough lacking in features such as a bonus round, the free spin feature is what sets this NextGen Gaming slot machine apart.\nBy triggering free spins in this medium-variance slot game, you'll have even more chances to win, thanks to the two sets of wilds on the reels. And if you're lucky enough to hit a 5 of a kind on a payline, it will be multiplied by five.\nThe game's slot machine design is almost cartoonish and resembles a retro animation from Warner Bros - we half expected the chicken to jump out and run across the screen. When the wins hit, the symbols animate and almost jump off the reels. The Golden Hen slot machine has a return to player (RTP) percentage of 97.22%.\nThe standard hen is the wild and only appears on reels 2, 3, and 4. The wild has the power to transform into any other symbol on the reels (except scatter) to help boost your bankroll by completing the winning paylines.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDolphin Reef is a rather attractive slot for fans of the sea. The sweet graphics depict numerous sea creatures, from clownfish to turtles, seahorses, and starfish. These are beautifully rendered, although there's a lot of empty space on the screen. Semi-transparent symbols with an appropriately epic ocean background behind them would have created a more spectacular look.\n            ",

The game is a medium-volatility slot, so wins are awarded frequently, but they might not be as big as in high-volatility slots.\n\nFarmyard Setting and Symbols\n\nGolden Hen features a farmyard setting with reels that resemble a chicken coop. The game symbols include chicken, chick, standard hen, egg, and feathered dreamcatcher. There are also the typical poker values of 9, 10, J, Q, K and A.\n\nNon-Progressive Jackpot of 2,000 Coins\n\nGolden Hen comes with a non-progressive jackpot of 2,000 coins, which is won when players land 5 of the standard hen symbols on adjacent reels.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nThe wild symbol in Golden Hen is the rooster, and it substitutes for all symbols except the scatter. The scatter symbol is the golden chicken, and getting three or more of them across the reels triggers the free spins bonus.\n\nFree Spins and Two Sets of Wilds\n\nGolden Hen's free spins feature is triggered when players land three or more golden chicken symbols. During free spins, both the wild and the scatter symbols are combined into a single icon, and they activate two sets of wilds on the reels, which increases players' chances of winning. The two sets of wilds can award players a 5x multiplier if they land a 5 of a kind payline.\n\nRTP Percentage of 97.22%\n\nGolden Hen has an RTP percentage of 97.22%, which is higher than the average in the online slot game industry. This means that players can expect to receive, on average, $97.22 in winnings for every $100 they wager on this game.\n\n        \n            ",

With wilds, scatters, free spins and a non-progressive jackpot of 2,000 coins up for grabs, you'll feel like you've stepped onto a farm when you play Golden Hen. Get your hands dirty as you explore the different ways to win under the reels. Spin the reels for as little as 0.25 up to a maximum of 250.00, ensuring that this action-packed slot game from NextGen Gaming is accessible to every budget.\nAs experienced gamblers know, Next Gen Gaming is known for its unique slot games, and Golden Hen is no exception. With a farmyard setting complete with a chicken coop full of hens, this game offers five reels and up to 243 ways to win on each spin. Featuring both wild and scatter symbols, this game also offers regular free spins. Join Uncle Tobias on the farm and strike it big by finding the elusive golden rooster.\nThe game has an animal lover feel to it, with the background of the game situated in a farm field with a forest in the distance. The reel backgrounds are a vibrant blue, while the icons above them are bright and comic-like. The symbols on the reels include chicks, eggs with legs poking out, grown chickens and the chicken coop. There are also typical poker icons like the king and queen, with nails sticking out and adding to the feel of the farm.\nGolden Hen is a classic online slot game with five reels, but there are 243 paylines on offer. The paylines are fixed, meaning you must play all of them on each spin, but this also means you have even more chances to win. The game's design is inspired by a farm, with the reels being fenced in a cornfield waiting to be harvested, the sky is blue and the fields are green, giving it a typical rural setting.\nAll of the game's symbols are positioned on the real blue reels and include the golden hen, standard hen, feathered dreamcatcher, chicken at dawn, farm, chicken, chick, egg, and card values 9, 10, J, Q, K and A.\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe wild symbol in Golden Hen is the rooster, but there's a twist: this icon will only appear on the second, third and fourth reels of the board. In another unique feature, the rooster can substitute for any single icon on the board, which includes the scatter symbol! This is truly rare and increases the potential for a big spin and a heavy payout.\nSpeaking of the scatter symbol, this is another feature that stands out with the golden chicken. It looks like a circle with a feather hanging on the side, and arrives only on the three middle reels. Winning on the scatter will multiply your winnings by a decent amount of coins. If you're playing a free spin, both the wild and the scatter are combined into a single icon. They will still appear on the three middle reels and replace any other symbol on the board. Getting three or more scatters or wilds will give you ten free games. Five of them win in a free game and also lead to a 5x multiplier.\nAlthough lacking in features such as a bonus round, the free spin feature is what sets this NextGen Gaming slot machine apart.\nBy triggering free spins in this medium-variance slot game, you'll have even more chances to win, thanks to the two sets of wilds on the reels. And if you're lucky enough to hit a 5 of a kind on a payline, it will be multiplied by five.\nThe game's slot machine design is almost cartoonish and resembles a retro animation from Warner Bros - we half expected the chicken to jump out and run across the screen. When the wins hit, the symbols animate and almost jump off the reels.

With wilds, scatters, free spins and a non-progressive jackpot of 2,000 coins up for grabs, you'll feel like you've stepped onto a farm when you play Golden Hen. Get your hands dirty as you explore the different ways to win under the reels. Spin the reels for as little as 0.25 up to a maximum of 250.00, ensuring that this action-packed slot game from NextGen Gaming is accessible to every budget.\nAs experienced gamblers know, Next Gen Gaming is known for its unique slot games, and Golden Hen is no exception. With a farmyard setting complete with a chicken coop full of hens, this game offers five reels and up to 243 ways to win on each spin. Featuring both wild and scatter symbols, this game also offers regular free spins. Join Uncle Tobias on the farm and strike it big by finding the elusive golden rooster.\nThe game has an animal lover feel to it, with the background of the game situated in a farm field with a forest in the distance. The reel backgrounds are a vibrant blue, while the icons above them are bright and comic-like. The symbols on the reels include chicks, eggs with legs poking out, grown chickens and the chicken coop. There are also typical poker icons like the king and queen, with nails sticking out and adding to the feel of the farm.\nGolden Hen is a classic online slot game with five reels, but there are 243 paylines on offer. The paylines are fixed, meaning you must play all of them on each spin, but this also means you have even more chances to win. The game's design is inspired by a farm, with the reels being fenced in a cornfield waiting to be harvested, the sky is blue and the fields are green, giving it a typical rural setting.\nAll of the game's symbols are positioned on the real blue reels and include the golden hen, standard hen, feathered dreamcatcher, chicken at dawn, farm, chicken, chick, egg, and card values 9, 10, J, Q, K and A.\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\nThe wild symbol in Golden Hen is the rooster, but there's a twist: this icon will only appear on the second, third and fourth reels of the board. In another unique feature, the rooster can substitute for any single icon on the board, which includes the scatter symbol! This is truly rare and increases the potential for a big spin and a heavy payout.\nSpeaking of the scatter symbol, this is another feature that stands out with the golden chicken. It looks like a circle with a feather hanging on the side, and arrives only on the three middle reels. Winning on the scatter will multiply your winnings by a decent amount of coins. If you're playing a free spin, both the wild and the scatter are combined into a single icon. They will still appear on the three middle reels and replace any other symbol on the board. Getting three or more scatters or wilds will give you ten free games. Five of them win in a free game and also lead to a 5x multiplier.\nAlthough lacking in features such as a bonus round, the free spin feature is what sets this NextGen Gaming slot machine apart.\nBy triggering free spins in this medium-variance slot game, you'll have even more chances to win, thanks to the two sets of wilds on the reels. And if you're lucky enough to hit a 5 of a kind on a payline, it will be multiplied by five.\nThe game's slot machine design is almost cartoonish and resembles a retro animation from Warner Bros - we half expected the chicken to jump out and run across the screen. When the wins hit, the symbols animate and almost jump off the reels. The Golden Hen slot machine has a return to player (RTP) percentage of 97.22%.\nThe standard hen is the wild and only appears on reels 2, 3, and 4. The wild has the power to transform into any other symbol on the reels (except scatter) to help boost your bankroll by completing the winning paylines.\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDolphin Reef is a rather attractive slot for fans of the sea. The sweet graphics depict numerous sea creatures, from clownfish to turtles, seahorses, and starfish. These are beautifully rendered, although there's a lot of empty space on the screen. Semi-transparent symbols with an appropriately epic ocean background behind them would have created a more spectacular look.\n            ",
