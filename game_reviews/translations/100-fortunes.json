But if often Chinese-themed slots are limited to aspects related to the Lunar New Year, in this case it is not exactly so. But let's talk about it more in the review below!\n\n100 Fortunes - Graphics\n\nLet's start this review by looking at a often overlooked aspect: graphics. In 100 Fortunes we find ourselves teleported to an old Chinese village, as evidenced by the white stone buildings and the characteristic pagoda roofs illuminated by red paper lanterns.\n\nThe game grid adopts this particular aesthetic to frame the reels on which we will see symbols scrolling after each of our spins. As for the symbols, these are actually more inspired by Western slots since we will see the symbols of the cards: Ace, King, Queen and Jack.\n\nTogether with these colorful letters, we will also see more typical symbols: Chinese coins, plates and Ming vases, and lucky cat. 100 Fortunes brings Chinese culture home with a perfectly crafted slot down to the smallest detail. Let's see now if the same can be said for its gameplay.\n\n100 Fortunes - Gameplay\n\nA glance at 100 Fortunes is enough to understand that we are facing a very different slot compared to most titles that can be found online. The game grid is immense, with five reels showing six symbols each. The total thus obtained per spin is 30 symbols, against the classic fifteen. The RTP, that is, the percentage of return for the player, is 96.12%, making this title perfectly in line with the market average.\n\nOf course, we also find in this case a Wild symbol represented by the oriental yo-yo which allows us to further expand the game grid by accessing the free spins in which we will be rewarded with a huge amount of Wild symbols, making it one of the most interesting and entertaining bonus modes to play.\n\nWe definitely recommend this slot to those who have appreciated expanding slots such as Megaways where it is possible to invest in hopes of having a significant return in the form of a win.\n\n100 Fortunes - Similar Slots\n\nThere are countless slots that exploit the oriental theme, which is why we have a lot of choice in case we want to try titles that use the same theme. Among these, we find Feng Fu, 88 Fortunes Megaways and Geisha's Fan, although in this latter case we move more towards Japan (a country that is enjoying growing popularity among online slots), moving away from China.",

But if often Chinese-themed slots are limited to aspects related to the Lunar New Year, in this case it is not exactly so. But let's talk about it more in the review below!\n\n100 Fortunes - Graphics\n\nLet's start this review by looking at a often overlooked aspect: graphics. In 100 Fortunes we find ourselves teleported to an old Chinese village, as evidenced by the white stone buildings and the characteristic pagoda roofs illuminated by red paper lanterns.\n\nThe game grid adopts this particular aesthetic to frame the reels on which we will see symbols scrolling after each of our spins. As for the symbols, these are actually more inspired by Western slots since we will see the symbols of the cards: Ace, King, Queen and Jack.\n\nTogether with these colorful letters, we will also see more typical symbols: Chinese coins, plates and Ming vases, and lucky cat. 100 Fortunes brings Chinese culture home with a perfectly crafted slot down to the smallest detail. Let's see now if the same can be said for its gameplay.\n\n100 Fortunes - Gameplay\n\nA glance at 100 Fortunes is enough to understand that we are facing a very different slot compared to most titles that can be found online. The game grid is immense, with five reels showing six symbols each. The total thus obtained per spin is 30 symbols, against the classic fifteen. The RTP, that is, the percentage of return for the player, is 96.12%, making this title perfectly in line with the market average.\n\nOf course, we also find in this case a Wild symbol represented by the oriental yo-yo which allows us to further expand the game grid by accessing the free spins in which we will be rewarded with a huge amount of Wild symbols, making it one of the most interesting and entertaining bonus modes to play.\n\nWe definitely recommend this slot to those who have appreciated expanding slots such as Megaways where it is possible to invest in hopes of having a significant return in the form of a win.\n\n100 Fortunes - Similar Slots\n\nThere are countless slots that exploit the oriental theme, which is why we have a lot of choice in case we want to try titles that use the same theme. Among these, we find Feng Fu, 88 Fortunes Megaways and Geisha's Fan, although in this latter case we move more towards Japan (a country that is enjoying growing popularity among online slots), moving away from China.\n            ",

But if often Chinese-themed slots are limited to aspects related to the Lunar New Year, in this case it is not exactly so. But let's talk about it more in the review below!\n\n100 Fortunes - Graphics\n\nLet's start this review by looking at a often overlooked aspect: graphics. In 100 Fortunes we find ourselves teleported to an old Chinese village, as evidenced by the white stone buildings and the characteristic pagoda roofs illuminated by red paper lanterns.\n\nThe game grid adopts this particular aesthetic to frame the reels on which we will see symbols scrolling after each of our spins. As for the symbols, these are actually more inspired by Western slots since we will see the symbols of the cards: Ace, King, Queen and Jack.\n\nTogether with these colorful letters, we will also see more typical symbols: Chinese coins, plates and Ming vases, and lucky cat. 100 Fortunes brings Chinese culture home with a perfectly crafted slot down to the smallest detail. Let's see now if the same can be said for its gameplay.\n\n100 Fortunes - Gameplay\n\nA glance at 100 Fortunes is enough to understand that we are facing a very different slot compared to most titles that can be found online. The game grid is immense, with five reels showing six symbols each. The total thus obtained per spin is 30 symbols, against the classic fifteen. The RTP, that is, the percentage of return for the player, is 96.12%, making this title perfectly in line with the market average.\n\nOf course, we also find in this case a Wild symbol represented by the oriental yo-yo which allows us to further expand the game grid by accessing the free spins in which we will be rewarded with a huge amount of Wild symbols, making it one of the most interesting and entertaining bonus modes to play.\n\nWe definitely recommend this slot to those who have appreciated expanding slots such as Megaways where it is possible to invest in hopes of having a significant return in the form of a win.\n\n100 Fortunes - Similar Slots\n\nThere are countless slots that exploit the oriental theme, which is why we have a lot of choice in case we want to try titles that use the same theme. Among these, we find Feng Fu, 88 Fortunes Megaways and Geisha's Fan, although in this latter case we move more towards Japan (a country that is enjoying growing popularity among online slots), moving away from China.\n            ",

But if often Chinese-themed slots are limited to aspects related to the Lunar New Year, in this case it is not exactly so. But let's talk about it more in the review below!\n\n100 Fortunes - Graphics\n\nLet's start this review by looking at a often overlooked aspect: graphics. In 100 Fortunes we find ourselves teleported to an old Chinese village, as evidenced by the white stone buildings and the characteristic pagoda roofs illuminated by red paper lanterns.\n\nThe game grid adopts this particular aesthetic to frame the reels on which we will see symbols scrolling after each of our spins. As for the symbols, these are actually more inspired by Western slots since we will see the symbols of the cards: Ace, King, Queen and Jack.\n\nTogether with these colorful letters, we will also see more typical symbols: Chinese coins, plates and Ming vases, and lucky cat. 100 Fortunes brings Chinese culture home with a perfectly crafted slot down to the smallest detail. Let's see now if the same can be said for its gameplay.\n\n100 Fortunes - Gameplay\n\nA glance at 100 Fortunes is enough to understand that we are facing a very different slot compared to most titles that can be found online. The game grid is immense, with five reels showing six symbols each. The total thus obtained per spin is 30 symbols, against the classic fifteen. The RTP, that is, the percentage of return for the player, is 96.12%, making this title perfectly in line with the market average.\n\nOf course, we also find in this case a Wild symbol represented by the oriental yo-yo which allows us to further expand the game grid by accessing the free spins in which we will be rewarded with a huge amount of Wild symbols, making it one of the most interesting and entertaining bonus modes to play.\n\nWe definitely recommend this slot to those who have appreciated expanding slots such as Megaways where it is possible to invest in hopes of having a significant return in the form of a win.\n\n100 Fortunes - Similar Slots\n\nThere are countless slots that exploit the oriental theme, which is why we have a lot of choice in case we want to try titles that use the same theme. Among these, we find Feng Fu, 88 Fortunes Megaways and Geisha's Fan, although in this latter case we move more towards Japan (a country that is enjoying growing popularity among online slots), moving away from China.\n        ",
