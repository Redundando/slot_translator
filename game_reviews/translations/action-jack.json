Giocabile da 0,40€ a €800 a rotazione su tutti i dispositivi, è dotato di simboli impilati per le vittorie più grandi. C’è anche una funzione Free Spins Bonus dove tutte le vincite sono soggette a un moltiplicatore 3x – su un massimo di 500 giri gratuiti.\nUna grafica avventurosa\nPartite per l’avventura di una vita con Action Jack in questa slot machine online del software Spielo. Forse vi sarete già imbattuti in questo impavido avventuriero in passato, dato che il personaggio è stato in giro per alcuni anni nel settore dei giochi terrestri, ma ora i giocatori possono godersi la frenetica ricerca di tesori comodamente da casa propria.\nQuesta slot machine a 5 rulli e 40 linee a pagamento offre un gameplay emozionante a bassa volatilità, il che significa che i giocatori non dovrebbero aspettare troppo a lungo prima che le vittorie comincino ad arrivare. Inoltre, questa video slot ha il potenziale per esplodere con alcuni premi enormi grazie a un giro di 60 giri gratis.\nDopo di che, i giocatori possono sperare di allineare varie combinazioni di simboli per aumentare il loro equilibrio di scommesse. Cinque simboli del vulcano su una linea a pagamento assegnerà un premio moltiplicatore di scommesse di 1.000x, mentre cinque figure di artefatti d’oro assegneranno 300x e cinque icone di gemme o porte corrispondenti pagheranno 250x.\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nVisivamente, Action Jack ha una grafica in stile cartoon e ha un tocco azteco – ambientato nel profondo della giungla, i simboli sui rulli includono A, K, Q, J e 10 reali così come mappe del tesoro, cascate di lava, cancelli, amuleti, statue misteriose e vulcani in eruzione – quest’ultimo è il simbolo più gratificante con 5 su una linea di pagamento che ti dà 25 volte la tua puntata. Action Jack stesso è il simbolo selvaggio e sostituisce tutti i simboli tranne la dispersione – appare solo sulle bobine 2, 3, 4 e 5.\nAction Jack è dotato di una funzione Synchronised Reels (bobine sincronizzate) – ogni bobina nel gioco include pile dello stesso simbolo (barra lo scatter bonus). Prima di ogni giro, viene scelto a caso un set di bobine con 1 dei simboli impilati. Quel simbolo può apparire impilato su più bobine per aumentare il potenziale di vincita.\nAction Jack è una slot machine a bassa varianza, il che significa essenzialmente che i giocatori non avranno bisogno di aspettare troppo a lungo prima che le combinazioni vincenti comincino ad apparire sulle 40 linee di pagamento. Come tale, il gioco è sempre piuttosto eccitante da giocare, anche se i valori complessivi dei premi sono piuttosto piccoli se paragonati ad alcune video slot online. Infatti, uno dei più grandi jackpot di base del gioco può essere trovato ogni volta che cinque simboli sparpagliati del forziere del tesoro appaiono per moltiplicare la scommessa totale per 25x.\nLa slot è anche dotata di un bonus gratuito per i giri, a cui si accede quando si ottengono 3 o più spargimenti di bonus del forziere del tesoro in qualsiasi punto dei rulli – 3, 4 o 5 spargimenti vi daranno 3, 10 o 25 volte la vostra puntata, oltre a 20, 40 o 60 giri gratuiti.\nInoltre, tutte le vincite durante la funzione sono soggette a un moltiplicatore 3x. Se otterrete 3 o più scatters durante un giro gratis, recupererete la caratteristica. È possibile recuperare l’elemento più volte con un massimo di 500 giri gratuiti da vincere in totale.\nAction Jack è uno slot abbastanza semplice – il massimo che puoi vincere è 1.000 volte la tua puntata se riempi le bobine interamente con vulcani in eruzione. Se lo fai durante un giro gratis, il moltiplicatore 3x ti darà 3.000 volte la tua puntata. È un gioco di media varianza così ben bilanciato in tutto il gioco.\nNel complesso, Action Jack è uno slot decente che è tutto sul moltiplicatore di tre volte nella funzione Free Spins Bonus.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nSe vi piace il tema, ce ne sono molti altri simili, come “Leggenda del giaguaro” di Playtech e “Lost Relics” di NetEnt. Per quanto riguarda la Slot Machine prodotta da NetEnt, per esempio, potrai contare su una vincita massima di 120,000€!\n",

You may have already encountered this fearless adventurer in the past, as the character has been around for a few years in the land-based gaming industry, but now players can enjoy the frantic search for treasures from the comfort of their own homes.\n\nThis 5-reel, 40 payline slot machine offers exciting low volatility gameplay, which means that players shouldn't have to wait too long before the wins start coming. Additionally, this video slot has the potential to explode with some huge prizes thanks to a round of 60 free spins.\n\nAfter that, players can hope to line up various symbol combinations to increase their betting balance. Five volcano symbols on a payline will award a 1,000x betting multiplier prize, while five gold artifact figures will award 300x and five gem or matching door icons will pay out 250x.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of Slot Machine\nVisually, Action Jack has a cartoon-style graphics and an Aztec touch - set in the depths of the jungle, the symbols on the reels include A, K, Q, J and 10 royals as well as treasure maps, lava waterfalls, gates, amulets, mysterious statues, and erupting volcanoes - the latter being the most rewarding symbol with 5 on a payline giving you 25 times your bet. Action Jack himself is the wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the scatter - it appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nAction Jack is equipped with a Synchronized Reels feature - each reel in the game includes stacks of the same symbol (excluding the bonus scatter bar). Before each spin, a set of reels is randomly chosen with 1 of the stacked symbols. That symbol can appear stacked on multiple reels to increase the potential for winning.\n\nAction Jack is a low variance slot machine, which essentially means that players won't have to wait too long before winning combinations start appearing on the 40 paylines. As such, the game is always exciting to play, even though the overall prize values are quite small compared to some online video slots. In fact, one of the biggest base jackpots of the game can be found whenever five scatter treasure chest symbols appear to multiply the total bet by 25x.\n\nThe slot game is also equipped with a free spins bonus, which is accessed when you get 3 or more treasure chest bonus scatters anywhere on the reels - 3, 4, or 5 scatters will give you 3, 10, or 25 times your bet, plus 20, 40, or 60 free spins.\n\nAdditionally, all wins during the feature are subject to a 3x multiplier. If you get 3 or more scatters during a free spin, you will trigger the feature again. You can trigger the feature multiple times with up to 500 free spins to be won in total.\n\nAction Jack is a pretty simple slot - the most you can win is 1,000 times your bet if you fill the reels entirely with erupting volcanoes. If you do it during a free spin, the 3x multiplier will give you 3,000 times your bet. It's a medium variance game that is well-balanced throughout the game.\n\nOverall, Action Jack is a decent slot game that is all about the 3x multiplier in the Free Spins Bonus feature. Other similar slot machines include Playtech's \"Legend of the Jaguar\" and NetEnt's \"Lost Relics.\" With regards to the NetEnt-produced Slot Machine, for example, you can expect a maximum win of €120,000!\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay features (stacked symbols, Free Spins Bonus, Synchronized Reels)\nJackpot and scatter symbols\nVolatility level\nGraphics and design style\nAvailability and compatibility\nOverall verdict on gameplay and winning potential\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Action Jack is powered by IGT and is a 5-reel, 40-payline slot game that takes you deep into the jungle in search of ancient treasures. Playable from €0.40 to €800 per spin on all devices, it features stacked symbols for bigger wins. There's also a Free Spins Bonus feature where all wins are subject to a 3x multiplier - up to 500 free spins.\n\nAn Adventurous Graphics\nEmbark on the adventure of a lifetime with Action Jack in this online slot machine from Spielo software. You may have already encountered this fearless adventurer in the past, as the character has been around for a few years in the land-based gaming industry, but now players can enjoy the frantic search for treasures from the comfort of their own homes.\n\nThis 5-reel, 40 payline slot machine offers exciting low volatility gameplay, which means that players shouldn't have to wait too long before the wins start coming. Additionally, this video slot has the potential to explode with some huge prizes thanks to a round of 60 free spins.\n\nAfter that, players can hope to line up various symbol combinations to increase their betting balance. Five volcano symbols on a payline will award a 1,000x betting multiplier prize, while five gold artifact figures will award 300x and five gem or matching door icons will pay out 250x.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of Slot Machine\nVisually, Action Jack has a cartoon-style graphics and an Aztec touch - set in the depths of the jungle, the symbols on the reels include A, K, Q, J and 10 royals as well as treasure maps, lava waterfalls, gates, amulets, mysterious statues, and erupting volcanoes - the latter being the most rewarding symbol with 5 on a payline giving you 25 times your bet. Action Jack himself is the wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the scatter - it appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nAction Jack is equipped with a Synchronized Reels feature - each reel in the game includes stacks of the same symbol (excluding the bonus scatter bar). Before each spin, a set of reels is randomly chosen with 1 of the stacked symbols. That symbol can appear stacked on multiple reels to increase the potential for winning.\n\nAction Jack is a low variance slot machine, which essentially means that players won't have to wait too long before winning combinations start appearing on the 40 paylines. As such, the game is always exciting to play, even though the overall prize values are quite small compared to some online video slots. In fact, one of the biggest base jackpots of the game can be found whenever five scatter treasure chest symbols appear to multiply the total bet by 25x.\n\nThe slot game is also equipped with a free spins bonus, which is accessed when you get 3 or more treasure chest bonus scatters anywhere on the reels - 3, 4, or 5 scatters will give you 3, 10, or 25 times your bet, plus 20, 40, or 60 free spins.\n\nAdditionally, all wins during the feature are subject to a 3x multiplier. If you get 3 or more scatters during a free spin, you will trigger the feature again. You can trigger the feature multiple times with up to 500 free spins to be won in total.\n\nAction Jack is a pretty simple slot - the most you can win is 1,000 times your bet if you fill the reels entirely with erupting volcanoes. If you do it during a free spin, the 3x multiplier will give you 3,000 times your bet. It's a medium variance game that is well-balanced throughout the game.\n\nOverall, Action Jack is a decent slot game that is all about the 3x multiplier in the Free Spins Bonus feature. Other similar slot machines include Playtech's \"Legend of the Jaguar\" and NetEnt's \"Lost Relics.\" With regards to the NetEnt-produced Slot Machine, for example, you can expect a maximum win of €120,000!\n            ",

Or a fancy pastry, if you're not into coffee.</p><p>And what about the wild symbol, you may ask? Action Jack himself is the wild and replaces all symbols, except the scatter- the treasure chest symbol. With such an adventurous hero on your side, you're sure to hit some impressive winnings in no time, especially since there is a chance to earn up to 25x total bet when five treasure chests appear on a single payline. </p><p>But wait, there's more! Five volcano symbols on a payline will bring you a 1,000x betting multiplier prize. That's more money than you would receive if you played the prospector and found real gold! Now, we are not recommending you go out and start digging in your backyard, but you get the point. Last but not least, let's not forget the five gold artifact figures that will award you 300x, or the five gem or matching door icons that can pay out 250x. </p><p>Overall, Action Jack is a fun and bright slot game with great winning potential, and we think it's worth trying out. Who knows, it might just become your new jungle adventure!</p>\"\n}"

It features low volatility gameplay with stacked symbols, which means that players shouldn't have to wait too long before the wins start coming. This online slot machine offers exciting gameplay, and offers the potential to win some huge prizes. This game also has a Synchronized Reels feature and a Free Spins Bonus feature where all wins are subject to a 3x multiplier - up to 500 free spins.\n\nFree Spins Bonus feature\n\nAction Jack has a Free Spins Bonus feature accessed by getting 3 or more treasure chest bonus scatters. During this feature, players can win 3, 10 or 25 times their bet, plus 20, 40, or 60 free spins. All wins during this feature are subject to a 3x multiplier. Players can trigger the feature again by getting 3 or more scatters, and they can trigger the feature multiple times with up to 500 free spins to be won in total.\n\nSymbol Design and Payout\n\nAction Jack has cartoon-style graphics and an Aztec touch, set in the depths of the jungle. The symbols on the reels include A, K, Q, J, and 10 royals as well as other jungle-related symbols. The most rewarding symbol is the erupting volcano, which gives a prize of 25x your bet when 5 appear on a payline. Action Jack himself is the wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the scatter which is the treasure chest symbol. The biggest base jackpot of the game is 25x total bet, which is won when five treasure chests appear. Five volcano symbols on a payline will award a 1,000x betting multiplier prize, while five gold artifact figures will award 300x, and five gem or matching door icons will pay out 250x.\n\nSynchronized Reels Feature\n\nAction Jack is equipped with a Synchronized Reels feature, which includes stacks of the same symbol on each reel (excluding the bonus scatter bar). Before each spin, a set of reels is randomly chosen with 1 of the stacked symbols. That symbol can appear stacked on multiple reels to increase the potential for winning.\n\nGraphics and Theme\n\nEmbark on the adventure of a lifetime with Action Jack in this online slot machine from Spielo software. The game has cartoon-style graphics and an Aztec theme. Set in the depths of the jungle, the symbols on the reels include A, K, Q, J, and 10 royals, treasure maps, lava waterfalls, gates, amulets, mysterious statues, and erupting volcanoes, making for a visually engaging and immersive experience.\n\nVariance and RTP\n\nAction Jack is a medium variance slot that is well-balanced throughout the game. The game has an RTP of 92.34% to 94.93%, which is slightly below average for online slots. This means that you might not win very often, but when you do, you'll be rewarded with significant payouts.\n\n        \n            ",

That symbol can appear stacked on multiple reels to increase the potential for winning.\n\nAction Jack is a low variance slot machine, which essentially means that players won't have to wait too long before winning combinations start appearing on the 40 paylines. As such, the game is always exciting to play, even though the overall prize values are quite small compared to some online video slots. In fact, one of the biggest base jackpots of the game can be found whenever five scatter treasure chest symbols appear to multiply the total bet by 25x.\n\nThe slot game is also equipped with a free spins bonus, which is accessed when you get 3 or more treasure chest bonus scatters anywhere on the reels - 3, 4, or 5 scatters will give you 3, 10, or 25 times your bet, plus 20, 40, or 60 free spins.\n\nAdditionally, all wins during the feature are subject to a 3x multiplier. If you get 3 or more scatters during a free spin, you will trigger the feature again. You can trigger the feature multiple times with up to 500 free spins to be won in total.\n\nAction Jack is a pretty simple slot - the most you can win is 1,000 times your bet if you fill the reels entirely with erupting volcanoes. If you do it during a free spin, the 3x multiplier will give you 3,000 times your bet. It's a medium variance game that is well-balanced throughout the game.\n\nOverall, Action Jack is a decent slot game that is all about the 3x multiplier in the Free Spins Bonus feature. Other similar slot machines include Playtech's \"Legend of the Jaguar\" and NetEnt's \"Lost Relics.\" With regards to the NetEnt-produced Slot Machine, for example, you can expect a maximum win of €120,000!\n            ",
