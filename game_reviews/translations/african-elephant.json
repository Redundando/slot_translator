As an experienced gambler, you'll appreciate the simplicity of both the gameplay and graphics. This game is set in Africa, the oldest continent in the world, and players participate in a wildlife photography safari. Against a clear, blue sky, players will traverse a savannah, encountering typical animals of the region along the way, including zebras, cheetahs, monkeys, and, of course, the African elephant! The game's most notable feature is its relaxing music, which is punctuated by the savannah's sounds and the trumpeting of elephants after each winning combination.\n\nFeatures of African Elephant:\nThe game's grid is comprised of five reels and four rows, hosting 20 spin symbols. The minimum bet per line is €0.01, with each spin costing just €0.20, given the 20 fixed paylines. One of the game's most exciting features is the high potential payout, which can reach up to 15,000x the bet. Players have several options to speed up gameplay, such as setting Quick Spin or Turbo Spin in the game's menu or activating automatic spins ranging from five to 100. Winning combinations are formed by matching identical symbols from left to right starting from the first reel.\n\nHow to Win at African Elephant:\nLet's take a look at the game's simple gameplay. As we mentioned before, the symbols are straightforward, and it's always best to check the paytable in the game menu for a detailed view of payouts.

The wild is also involved in the Wild Shape feature, where randomly selected positions on the reels will be framed and any symbol landing inside will be transformed into a wild. Elephant Charge is the game's scatter symbol. Land three, four, or five, and players will receive 10, 15, or 25 free spins, respectively. During free spins, Wild Shape is guaranteed on every spin. Another exciting feature is the Bonus feature, which can be purchased for 100 times the bet.\n\nFAQs:\nWhat type of symbols are found in African Elephant?\nThe game has low-level symbols, represented by playing cards, high-level symbols, which are animals, plus a wild and a scatter symbol.\n\nHow can players get free spins?\nFree spins are obtained by landing three, four, or five scatter symbols or by purchasing the feature for 100 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the game's volatility and theoretical return to player?\nAfrican Elephant has high volatility and an RTP of 96.04% during the base game and 96.07% during free spins.

As an experienced gambler, you'll appreciate the simplicity of both the gameplay and graphics. This game is set in Africa, the oldest continent in the world, and players participate in a wildlife photography safari. Against a clear, blue sky, players will traverse a savannah, encountering typical animals of the region along the way, including zebras, cheetahs, monkeys, and, of course, the African elephant! The game's most notable feature is its relaxing music, which is punctuated by the savannah's sounds and the trumpeting of elephants after each winning combination.\n\nFeatures of African Elephant:\nThe game's grid is comprised of five reels and four rows, hosting 20 spin symbols. The minimum bet per line is €0.01, with each spin costing just €0.20, given the 20 fixed paylines. One of the game's most exciting features is the high potential payout, which can reach up to 15,000x the bet. Players have several options to speed up gameplay, such as setting Quick Spin or Turbo Spin in the game's menu or activating automatic spins ranging from five to 100. Winning combinations are formed by matching identical symbols from left to right starting from the first reel.\n\nHow to Win at African Elephant:\nLet's take a look at the game's simple gameplay. As we mentioned before, the symbols are straightforward, and it's always best to check the paytable in the game menu for a detailed view of payouts. The least lucrative symbols are the playing cards ranging from Jack to Ace, while the animals payout much more. In order, players will find meerkats, cheetahs, buffalos, zebras, and rhinoceroses. Players can also complete combinations using the wild symbol, in this case represented by the elephant. Not only is the elephant the highest-paying symbol overall, but it also replaces all symbols except for the scatter symbol. The wild is also involved in the Wild Shape feature, where randomly selected positions on the reels will be framed and any symbol landing inside will be transformed into a wild. Elephant Charge is the game's scatter symbol. Land three, four, or five, and players will receive 10, 15, or 25 free spins, respectively. During free spins, Wild Shape is guaranteed on every spin. Another exciting feature is the Bonus feature, which can be purchased for 100 times the bet.\n\nFAQs:\nWhat type of symbols are found in African Elephant?\nThe game has low-level symbols, represented by playing cards, high-level symbols, which are animals, plus a wild and a scatter symbol.\n\nHow can players get free spins?\nFree spins are obtained by landing three, four, or five scatter symbols or by purchasing the feature for 100 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the game's volatility and theoretical return to player?\nAfrican Elephant has high volatility and an RTP of 96.04% during the base game and 96.07% during free spins. As an experienced gambler, you'll appreciate the high payout potential and straightforward gameplay of this exciting slot game.\n            ",

The least lucrative symbols are the playing cards ranging from Jack to Ace, while the animals payout much more. In order, players will find meerkats, cheetahs, buffalos, zebras, and rhinoceroses.

Not only is the elephant the highest-paying symbol overall, but it also replaces all symbols except for the scatter symbol. The wild is also involved in the Wild Shape feature, where randomly selected positions on the reels will be framed and any symbol landing inside will be transformed into a wild. Elephant Charge is the game's scatter symbol. Land three, four, or five, and players will receive 10, 15, or 25 free spins, respectively. During free spins, Wild Shape is guaranteed on every spin. Another exciting feature is the Bonus feature, which can be purchased for 100 times the bet.\n\nFAQs:\nWhat type of symbols are found in African Elephant?\nThe game has low-level symbols, represented by playing cards, high-level symbols, which are animals, plus a wild and a scatter symbol.\n\nHow can players get free spins?\nFree spins are obtained by landing three, four, or five scatter symbols or by purchasing the feature for 100 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the game's volatility and theoretical return to player?\nAfrican Elephant has high volatility and an RTP of 96.04% during the base game and 96.07% during free spins.

As an experienced gambler, you'll appreciate the simplicity of both the gameplay and graphics. This game is set in Africa, the oldest continent in the world, and players participate in a wildlife photography safari. Against a clear, blue sky, players will traverse a savannah, encountering typical animals of the region along the way, including zebras, cheetahs, monkeys, and, of course, the African elephant! The game's most notable feature is its relaxing music, which is punctuated by the savannah's sounds and the trumpeting of elephants after each winning combination.\n\nFeatures of African Elephant:\nThe game's grid is comprised of five reels and four rows, hosting 20 spin symbols. The minimum bet per line is €0.01, with each spin costing just €0.20, given the 20 fixed paylines.

Elephant Charge is the game's scatter symbol. Land three, four, or five, and players will receive 10, 15, or 25 free spins, respectively. During free spins, Wild Shape is guaranteed on every spin. Another exciting feature is the Bonus feature, which can be purchased for 100 times the bet.\n\nFAQs:\nWhat type of symbols are found in African Elephant?\nThe game has low-level symbols, represented by playing cards, high-level symbols, which are animals, plus a wild and a scatter symbol.\n\nHow can players get free spins?\nFree spins are obtained by landing three, four, or five scatter symbols or by purchasing the feature for 100 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the game's volatility and theoretical return to player?\nAfrican Elephant has high volatility and an RTP of 96.04% during the base game and 96.07% during free spins.

As an experienced gambler, you'll appreciate the simplicity of both the gameplay and graphics. This game is set in Africa, the oldest continent in the world, and players participate in a wildlife photography safari. Against a clear, blue sky, players will traverse a savannah, encountering typical animals of the region along the way, including zebras, cheetahs, monkeys, and, of course, the African elephant! The game's most notable feature is its relaxing music, which is punctuated by the savannah's sounds and the trumpeting of elephants after each winning combination.\n\nFeatures of African Elephant:\nThe game's grid is comprised of five reels and four rows, hosting 20 spin symbols. The minimum bet per line is €0.01, with each spin costing just €0.20, given the 20 fixed paylines. One of the game's most exciting features is the high potential payout, which can reach up to 15,000x the bet. Players have several options to speed up gameplay, such as setting Quick Spin or Turbo Spin in the game's menu or activating automatic spins ranging from five to 100. Winning combinations are formed by matching identical symbols from left to right starting from the first reel.\n\nHow to Win at African Elephant:\nLet's take a look at the game's simple gameplay. As we mentioned before, the symbols are straightforward, and it's always best to check the paytable in the game menu for a detailed view of payouts. The least lucrative symbols are the playing cards ranging from Jack to Ace, while the animals payout much more. In order, players will find meerkats, cheetahs, buffalos, zebras, and rhinoceroses. Players can also complete combinations using the wild symbol, in this case represented by the elephant. Not only is the elephant the highest-paying symbol overall, but it also replaces all symbols except for the scatter symbol. The wild is also involved in the Wild Shape feature, where randomly selected positions on the reels will be framed and any symbol landing inside will be transformed into a wild. Elephant Charge is the game's scatter symbol. Land three, four, or five, and players will receive 10, 15, or 25 free spins, respectively. During free spins, Wild Shape is guaranteed on every spin. Another exciting feature is the Bonus feature, which can be purchased for 100 times the bet.\n\nFAQs:\nWhat type of symbols are found in African Elephant?\nThe game has low-level symbols, represented by playing cards, high-level symbols, which are animals, plus a wild and a scatter symbol.\n\nHow can players get free spins?\nFree spins are obtained by landing three, four, or five scatter symbols or by purchasing the feature for 100 times the bet.\n\nWhat is the game's volatility and theoretical return to player?\nAfrican Elephant has high volatility and an RTP of 96.04% during the base game and 96.07% during free spins. As an experienced gambler, you'll appreciate the high payout potential and straightforward gameplay of this exciting slot game.\n            ",
