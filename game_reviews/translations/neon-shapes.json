Quando ci si avvicina a Neon Shapes bisogna farlo con la consapevolezza di non aspettarsi nulla di tradizionale da questa video slot. Nessun rullo, nessuna griglia di gioco predefinita, se non quella sulla quale è lo stesso giocatore che potrà intervenire. Ma in che modo? Praticamente sembra di trovarsi di fronte a una partita di Tetris dove diverse forme devono essere incastrate tra loro, dallo stesso giocatore, per sbloccare delle vincite al gioco. Il tutto affidandosi a un RTP del 96% e a un Jackpot massimo che merita grande attenzione. Scopriamo da vicino le caratteristiche di questa slot che, pur non presentando funzionalità particolari, riesce a offrire massimo intrattenimento con il suo gameplay innovativo.\nCaratteristiche e grafica della slot\nDescrivere la grafica di questa slot è abbastanza difficile proprio perché è necessario che ogni giocatore dimentichi tutto quello che conosce e sa delle slot machine. Nel momento in cui si avvia questo titolo ci si trova di fronte uno sfondo viola scuro e il classico tabellone di Tetris. Sulla destra appaiono tre forme che dovranno essere incastonate tra loro direttamente sulla “griglia”. La missione del gioco per un giocatore è quella di completare le linee, in verticale e orizzontale, per aumentare i propri punti e ottenere vincite più alte. Per giocare a questa slot bisogna quindi affidarsi alle proprie abilità e riuscire a riempire il contatore sul lato destro del tabellone per poter ruotare le forme e favorire così il completamento di nuove linee. Di solito servono 300 punti abilità per sbloccare la funzionalità che permette di ruotare gli elementi.\nÈ giusto ricordare che i punti abilità assegnati nel caso del posizionamento gli elementi sono 10, mentre liberando e completando una linea il giocatore riceve 100 punti. Durante il gameplay appariranno anche delle forme color oro o arancioni, per un totale di 38 elementi che prevedono pagamenti diversi. Gli elementi ordinari sono quelli che hanno una vincita più bassa, mentre va a salire il punteggio piazzando sia le forme arancioni che quelle oro.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Neon Shapes\nCome abbiamo detto non sono previste delle funzionalità speciali, dei simboli specifici e non assisteremo ai giri dei rulli di una regolare slot machine. Neon Shapes funziona proprio perché offre massima semplicità e la mette al servizio di un gioco che chiama attivamente un player a compiere le proprie mosse. Possiamo definirla una slot concettuale, che si ispira proprio a uno dei giochi più leggendari che siano mai stati proposti. Ti sarebbe mai venuto in mente di giocare a Tetris nella speranza di vincere ricche somme di denaro ad una slot machine? La risposta è no, ma questo è il momento giusto per provare!\n",

When approaching Neon Shapes, one must do so with the awareness of not expecting anything traditional from this video slot. No reels, no predefined game grid, except for the one on which the player himself can intervene. But how? It is practically like facing a game of Tetris where different shapes must be fitted together, by the player himself, to unlock game wins. All relying on a 96% RTP and a maximum jackpot that deserves great attention. Let's take a close look at the features of this slot that, even though it does not present particular functionalities, manages to offer maximum entertainment with its innovative gameplay.\nFeatures and graphics of the slot\nDescribing the graphics of this slot is quite difficult precisely because every player needs to forget everything he knows and knows about slot machines. When this title is started, one finds oneself facing a dark purple background and the classic Tetris board. On the right, three shapes appear that must be fitted together directly on the \"grid\". The game mission for a player is to complete lines, vertically and horizontally, to increase his points and obtain higher wins. To play this slot, one must therefore rely on one's skills and manage to fill the counter on the right side of the board to be able to rotate the shapes and thus favor the completion of new lines. Usually it takes 300 skill points to unlock the feature that allows you to rotate the elements.\nIt is worth remembering that the skill points assigned in the case of positioning the elements are 10, while freeing and completing a line the player receives 100 points. During gameplay, gold or orange-colored shapes will also appear, for a total of 38 elements that provide different payouts. The ordinary elements are those that have a lower win, while the score goes up by placing both orange and gold shapes.\nFinal considerations on the Neon Shapes slot\nAs we said, no special features are foreseen, no specific symbols, and we will not see the reels spinning of a regular slot machine. Neon Shapes works precisely because it offers maximum simplicity and puts it at the service of a game that actively calls a player to make his own moves. We can define it as a conceptual slot, which is inspired by one of the most legendary games ever proposed. Would you ever have thought of playing Tetris in the hope of winning rich sums of money at a slot machine? The answer is no, but this is the right time to try!",

When approaching Neon Shapes, one must do so with the awareness of not expecting anything traditional from this video slot. No reels, no predefined game grid, except for the one on which the player himself can intervene. But how? It is practically like facing a game of Tetris where different shapes must be fitted together, by the player himself, to unlock game wins. All relying on a 96% RTP and a maximum jackpot that deserves great attention. Let's take a close look at the features of this slot that, even though it does not present particular functionalities, manages to offer maximum entertainment with its innovative gameplay.\nFeatures and graphics of the slot\nDescribing the graphics of this slot is quite difficult precisely because every player needs to forget everything he knows and knows about slot machines. When this title is started, one finds oneself facing a dark purple background and the classic Tetris board. On the right, three shapes appear that must be fitted together directly on the \"grid\". The game mission for a player is to complete lines, vertically and horizontally, to increase his points and obtain higher wins. To play this slot, one must therefore rely on one's skills and manage to fill the counter on the right side of the board to be able to rotate the shapes and thus favor the completion of new lines. Usually it takes 300 skill points to unlock the feature that allows you to rotate the elements.\nIt is worth remembering that the skill points assigned in the case of positioning the elements are 10, while freeing and completing a line the player receives 100 points. During gameplay, gold or orange-colored shapes will also appear, for a total of 38 elements that provide different payouts. The ordinary elements are those that have a lower win, while the score goes up by placing both orange and gold shapes.\nFinal considerations on the Neon Shapes slot\nAs we said, no special features are foreseen, no specific symbols, and we will not see the reels spinning of a regular slot machine. Neon Shapes works precisely because it offers maximum simplicity and puts it at the service of a game that actively calls a player to make his own moves. We can define it as a conceptual slot, which is inspired by one of the most legendary games ever proposed. Would you ever have thought of playing Tetris in the hope of winning rich sums of money at a slot machine? The answer is no, but this is the right time to try!\n            ",

Unlike traditional video slots, it does not feature any predefined game grid or reels. Instead, players have to fit different shapes together to unlock game wins. The game relies on a 96% RTP and a maximum jackpot that deserves attention.\n\nGameplay mechanics and design\n\nNeon Shapes game mechanics require players to use their skills to fit shapes together on a Tetris-like board. The goal is to complete lines, vertically and horizontally, to increase the player's points and obtain higher wins. There are 38 elements in the game, including gold or orange-colored shapes that provide different payouts. The elements give both ordinary and higher win payouts when placed correctly. The game design features a dark purple background and a tetris board with three shapes on the right side of the board. Players can earn 10 skill points per positioning of elements, and 100 points for freeing and completing a line. When a player earns 300 skill points, they unlock the feature that allows them to rotate the elements.\n\nSkill-based gameplay\n\nThe Neon Shapes slot game is skill-based, meaning that a player's gaming experience and success depend on their ability to fit shapes together and complete lines. The game calls on the player to use their skills, manage the counter, and rotate the shapes to increase their points and receive higher payouts. It takes some practice to master the skills required to play the game successfully.\n\nRTP and jackpot\n\nNeon Shapes features an RTP of 96%, which is on par with the industry standard. The game also has a maximum jackpot that deserves attention and offers players a chance to win big. The payout percentage and maximum jackpot make the game appealing to players looking for high-paying and exciting slot games.\n\nSimplicity vs features\n\nAlthough Neon Shapes does not feature any specific symbols or special functionalities, it manages to offer maximum entertainment with its innovative and skill-based gameplay. The game's simplicity is its strength, as it puts the player in control and challenges them to use their skills to win. It is the perfect game for players looking for a break from traditional slots and wanting to try something new. Overall, this is a conceptual slot that offers a unique experience and deserves to be  tried.\n\n        \n            ",

When approaching Neon Shapes, one must do so with the awareness of not expecting anything traditional from this video slot. No reels, no predefined game grid, except for the one on which the player himself can intervene. But how? It is practically like facing a game of Tetris where different shapes must be fitted together, by the player himself, to unlock game wins. All relying on a 96% RTP and a maximum jackpot that deserves great attention. Let's take a close look at the features of this slot that, even though it does not present particular functionalities, manages to offer maximum entertainment with its innovative gameplay.\nFeatures and graphics of the slot\nDescribing the graphics of this slot is quite difficult precisely because every player needs to forget everything he knows and knows about slot machines. When this title is started, one finds oneself facing a dark purple background and the classic Tetris board. On the right, three shapes appear that must be fitted together directly on the \"grid\". The game mission for a player is to complete lines, vertically and horizontally, to increase his points and obtain higher wins. To play this slot, one must therefore rely on one's skills and manage to fill the counter on the right side of the board to be able to rotate the shapes and thus favor the completion of new lines. Usually it takes 300 skill points to unlock the feature that allows you to rotate the elements.\nIt is worth remembering that the skill points assigned in the case of positioning the elements are 10, while freeing and completing a line the player receives 100 points. During gameplay, gold or orange-colored shapes will also appear, for a total of 38 elements that provide different payouts. The ordinary elements are those that have a lower win, while the score goes up by placing both orange and gold shapes.\nFinal considerations on the Neon Shapes slot\nAs we said, no special features are foreseen, no specific symbols, and we will not see the reels spinning of a regular slot machine. Neon Shapes works precisely because it offers maximum simplicity and puts it at the service of a game that actively calls a player to make his own moves. We can define it as a conceptual slot, which is inspired by one of the most legendary games ever proposed. Would you ever have thought of playing Tetris in the hope of winning rich sums of money at a slot machine? The answer is no, but this is the right time to try!\n            ",
