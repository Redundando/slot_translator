As the title suggests, this slot machine is entirely focused on the life and legend of the undisputed King of Rock, Elvis Presley, who has sold hundreds of millions of records and continues to top the charts even after his death in 1976. Elvis Presley had several homes in Las Vegas, and a slot machine honoring his legacy seems like a fitting tribute from the casino world. \n\nThe graphics in Elvis Lives do not hold many surprises and are rather standard.

If playing on mobile devices, it is recommended to use Chrome for Android devices and Safari for iOS ones. \n\nSlot Features \nThe software developer WMS has chosen a traditional game structure for this slot game, with the standard five reels and 12 rows. Players can bet on 60 paylines, with a betting range from a minimum of 50 cents up to a maximum of €100 per spin, which could satisfy even the high rollers. However, the theoretical return to player (RTP) of this slot machine is rather disappointing at 95.86%, which is below average. Nevertheless, with some luck, players can obtain good winnings by paying attention to the many cash bonuses available. \n\nThe game also offers an Autoplay function, allowing players to set the automatic spins for those who do not wish to launch each spin manually. A unique feature of Elvis Lives is the ability for the second, third, and fourth reels to combine and form a singular reel on which giant symbols appear. \n\nSpecial Features of Elvis Lives \nThe special features of Elvis Lives are activated by the \"Bonus Activator\" symbols, which act as Scatter symbols and can trigger one of the four game options: \n\n-\"Aloha\" Free Spins: allows players to obtain seven free spins and benefit from two wild symbols that can also act as multipliers \n-\"TCB\" Free Spins: offers five free spins and through three symbols depicting rings of different colors, offers multipliers or additional free spins. \n-\"Track Suit Selector\" Bonus: an actual mini-game in which players have the chance to win the jackpot.\n-Elvis Lives Bonus: the game screen displays the words \"Elvis Lives.\" Depending on how many letters of this phrase light up, you will be awarded a different cash prize. \n\nIn conclusion, Elvis Lives is a rockin' slot game with an exciting tribute to the one and only King of Rock - Elvis Presley.

If playing on mobile devices, it is recommended to use Chrome for Android devices and Safari for iOS ones. \n\nSlot Features \nThe software developer WMS has chosen a traditional game structure for this slot game, with the standard five reels and 12 rows. Players can bet on 60 paylines, with a betting range from a minimum of 50 cents up to a maximum of €100 per spin, which could satisfy even the high rollers. However, the theoretical return to player (RTP) of this slot machine is rather disappointing at 95.86%, which is below average. Nevertheless, with some luck, players can obtain good winnings by paying attention to the many cash bonuses available. \n\nThe game also offers an Autoplay function, allowing players to set the automatic spins for those who do not wish to launch each spin manually. A unique feature of Elvis Lives is the ability for the second, third, and fourth reels to combine and form a singular reel on which giant symbols appear. \n\nSpecial Features of Elvis Lives \nThe special features of Elvis Lives are activated by the \"Bonus Activator\" symbols, which act as Scatter symbols and can trigger one of the four game options: \n\n-\"Aloha\" Free Spins: allows players to obtain seven free spins and benefit from two wild symbols that can also act as multipliers \n-\"TCB\" Free Spins: offers five free spins and through three symbols depicting rings of different colors, offers multipliers or additional free spins. \n-\"Track Suit Selector\" Bonus: an actual mini-game in which players have the chance to win the jackpot.\n-Elvis Lives Bonus: the game screen displays the words \"Elvis Lives.\" Depending on how many letters of this phrase light up, you will be awarded a different cash prize. \n\nIn conclusion, Elvis Lives is a rockin' slot game with an exciting tribute to the one and only King of Rock - Elvis Presley. With excellent music and exciting gameplay features, this game is perfect for experienced gamblers who are looking for some extra excitement to their spins!\n        ",
