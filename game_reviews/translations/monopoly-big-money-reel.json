Today, it's hard for anyone to take their eyes off their mobile devices long enough to realize they have a family. Many of you will remember the times when you would sit around a table, have fun, be competitive and then cry yourself to sleep when someone else won the game. \n\nNow, the well-known online gambling software developers, WMS, have released their latest Monopoly-themed slot game, the free Monopoly Big Money Reel slot, which, judging by first impressions, will be a huge success. Focused on a bonus game called \"Monopoly Big Money Reel Bonus Round,\" this online slot features game features that can be enormously profitable. Take a look at our review of this impressive 20-payline, 5-reel online fruit machine that has been thrilling players since its release not long ago. Surely, something special awaits you.\n\nA graphic from a famous board game\n\nVisually, Monopoly Big Money Reel is what you would expect from a Monopoly-themed production - it has cartoon-style graphics but has a luxurious look. With a jazzy soundtrack that plays while you spin the reels, the symbols include classic Monopoly pieces such as thimbles, boots, carts, and top hats. You will also see cars, boats, and planes.\n\nApparently stacked, you will come across Scotty the dog, a hotel, and Mr. Monopoly himself - the latter being the most rewarding that gives you 7.5 times your bet for 5 on a payline. The diamond-studded \"M\" symbol is the wild and substitutes for all symbols except the banknote symbols, which are worth 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500. \n\nYou will be impressed by the apparent quality that has been put into the development of the Monopoly Big Money Reel video slot game. The online slot graphics, sound effects, and game animations will immediately strike you, and at this point, you will know that you will have fun. Even the animations and soundtrack are good, although the latter may begin to become annoying after a while - which you can easily turn off if it does.\n\nFeatures and symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nWhen it comes to bonus features, the first is the Mystery Bills feature - randomly, any of the 5 banknote symbols can be added to the reels. All notes can be changed to one of the note symbols - filling the reels with certain note symbols will give you 5, 10, 15, 15, 20, or 50 times your total bet.\n\nThe main attraction is the Monopoly Big Money Reel Spin Bonus feature that is played when any combination of 5 banknote symbols appears on the reels - spin a wheel to win cash bonuses up to 250 times your bet, a multiplier boost, or access to 2 more bonus features.\n\nIn the Utility Bonus feature, you start with 2.5 times the bet as credit - then choose a hand from Mr. Monopoly to reveal the spin, which will make you collect x2. For the spin, you spin the Big Money Reel to win cash prizes and/or multipliers. These continue until you land on Collect or Collect x2 - the latter will double the amount of your win.\n\nFinally, there is the Go Free Spins Bonus feature where you start with 8 free spins - each Go symbol gives you a banknote symbol that changes all note symbols to that particular note on each free spin. You then get the corresponding prize. With more free spins to be won, you can also win additional cash bonuses.\n\nThe wild will act like any other wild in online slots, substituting for all symbols except those for Free Spins. As for the scatter symbols, these are, in our opinion, the most important symbols in the entire online slot. Landing the scatters at least five times on the reels will activate the \"Big Money Reel\" bonus game, which is so central to this slot. Each of the money bill scatter symbols used will be assigned a multiplier that will stick with them for the duration of the bonus game.\n\nOnce the multipliers are set, you will be given a random number of spins on the big reel before starting to spin. All remaining symbols are standard paying symbols, the highest and lowest that will award payouts if you find them on paylines at least three times in a row.\n\nOther Similar Slot Machines\n\nFor those of you who have a real passion for Monopoly, there are a couple of other WMS titles you might want to check out. \"Monopoly Big Event\" and \"Monopoly Once Around the World\" have both been around longer than Big Reel but have both been hugely successful. The first has 20 paylines and 5 reels, while the second has 15 paylines and 5 reels.\n\nNeither has the same quality of Big Reel features, but they are both a lot of fun. In fact, Big Event, with its free spins, multipliers, and low variance, has made it a very popular slot game that is still played by many today.",

Tutti i simboli rimanenti sono i simboli standard paganti più alti e più bassi che premieranno i pagamenti se li trovi sulle paylines almeno tre volte di fila.\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nPer quelli di voi che hanno davvero una passione sfrenata per Monopoly, ci sono un paio di altri titoli di WMS che potreste voler vedere. “Monopoly Big Event” e “Monopoly Once Around the World” sono entrambi in circolazione da più tempo di Big Reel, ma hanno entrambi riscosso un enorme successo. Il primo ha 20 linee di pagamento e 5 bobine, mentre il secondo contiene 15 linee di pagamento e 5 bobine.\nNessuna delle due ha la stessa qualità di caratteristiche di Big Reel, ma sono entrambe molto divertenti. Infatti, il Big Event, con i suoi giri gratis, i moltiplicatori, la bassa varianza lo hanno reso una slot molto popolare che ancora oggi viene giocato da molti.\n\n        ",

Nowadays, it's hard for everyone to take their eyes off their mobile devices long enough to realize they have a family. Many of you will remember the times when you sat around a table, had fun, were competitive, and then cried yourself to sleep when someone else won the game.\n\nWMS, the well-known developers of online gambling software, have now released their latest Monopoly-themed slot game, the free Monopoly Big Money Reel slot, which, judging by first impressions, will be a huge success. Focused on a ‘Monopoly Big Money Reel Bonus Round’ bonus game, this online slot is fully loaded with game features that can be hugely profitable. Check out our review on this impressive online fruit machine with 20 paylines and 5 reels that has excited everyone since its release not long ago. Surely, something special awaits you.\n\nA Familiar Board Game Visual\n\nVisually, Monopoly Big Money Reel is what you’d expect from a Monopoly-themed production – it has a cartoonish style graphics but has a luxurious look. With a very jazzy soundtrack playing as the reels spin, the symbols include classic Monopoly pieces such as thimbles, boots, wheelbarrows, and top hats. You’ll also see automobiles, boats, and planes.\n\nSeemingly stacked, you’ll come across Scotty the dog, a hotel, and Mr. Monopoly himself – the latter being the most rewarding, giving you 7.5 times your bet for 5 on a payline. The diamond-embedded M symbol is the wild and replaces all symbols except for the banknote symbols, namely the 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500.\n\nInitially, you will be very impressed by the apparent quality that has been put into the development of the Monopoly Big Money Reel video slot. The graphics of the online slot, sound effects, and game animations will strike you immediately and it is at this point that you know you will have fun. The animations and soundtrack are good too, although the latter may start to become annoying after a while – which you can simply turn off if it does.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nWhen it comes to bonus features, the first is the Mystery Bills feature – randomly, any of the 5 banknote symbols can be added to the reels. All notes can be changed into 1 of the note symbol – filling the reels with certain banknote symbols will give you 5, 10, 15, 15, 20, or 50 times your total bet.\n\nThe main attraction is the Monopoly Big Money Reel Spin Bonus feature which is played when any combination of 5 note symbols appears on the reels – you spin a wheel to win cash bonuses up to 250 times your bet, a multiplier boost, or access to 2 other bonus features.\n\nIn the Utility Bonus feature, you start with 2.5 times your bet as credits – then you choose a hand from Mr. Monopoly to reveal the spin, which will make you collect x2. For the spin, you spin the Big Money Reel to win cash prizes and/or multipliers. These continue until you land on Collect or Collect x2 – the latter will double the amount of your win.\n\nFinally, there is the Go Free Spins Bonus feature where you start with 8 free spins – each Go symbol will give you a note symbol that changes all note symbols to that particular note on each free spin. You then get the corresponding prize. With more free spins to be won, you can also win additional cash bonuses.\n\nThe wild will act like any other wild in online slots, substituting all symbols except for those for getting Free Spins. As for the scatter symbols, these, in our opinion, are the most important symbols of the entire online slot. Landing the scatter symbols at least five times on the reels will trigger the ‘Big Money Reel’ bonus game which is so central to this slot. Each of the money bill scatter symbols that have been used will be assigned a multiplier that will stick to them for the duration of the bonus game.\n\nOnce the multipliers have been set, you will be given a random number of spins on the big reel before it starts spinning. All remaining symbols are the highest and lowest-paying standard paying symbols that will award payouts if you find them on paylines at least three times in a row.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nFor those of you who have a really passionate devotion to Monopoly, there are a couple of other WMS titles you may want to look at. \"Monopoly Big Event\" and \"Monopoly Once Around the World\" have both been around longer than Big Reel but have both been hugely successful. The former has 20 paylines and 5 reels, while the latter has 15 paylines and 5 reels.\n\nNeither has the same quality of features as Big Reel, but they are both a lot of fun. In fact, Big Event, with its free spins, multipliers, and low variance, has made it a very popular slot that is still played by many today."

Nowadays, it's hard for everyone to take their eyes off their mobile devices long enough to realize they have a family. Many of you will remember the times when you sat around a table, had fun, were competitive, and then cried yourself to sleep when someone else won the game.\n\nWMS, the well-known developers of online gambling software, have now released their latest Monopoly-themed slot game, the free Monopoly Big Money Reel slot, which, judging by first impressions, will be a huge success. Focused on a ‘Monopoly Big Money Reel Bonus Round’ bonus game, this online slot is fully loaded with game features that can be hugely profitable. Check out our review on this impressive online fruit machine with 20 paylines and 5 reels that has excited everyone since its release not long ago. Surely, something special awaits you.\n\nA Familiar Board Game Visual\n\nVisually, Monopoly Big Money Reel is what you’d expect from a Monopoly-themed production – it has a cartoonish style graphics but has a luxurious look. With a very jazzy soundtrack playing as the reels spin, the symbols include classic Monopoly pieces such as thimbles, boots, wheelbarrows, and top hats. You’ll also see automobiles, boats, and planes.\n\nSeemingly stacked, you’ll come across Scotty the dog, a hotel, and Mr. Monopoly himself – the latter being the most rewarding, giving you 7.5 times your bet for 5 on a payline. The diamond-embedded M symbol is the wild and replaces all symbols except for the banknote symbols, namely the 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500.\n\nInitially, you will be very impressed by the apparent quality that has been put into the development of the Monopoly Big Money Reel video slot. The graphics of the online slot, sound effects, and game animations will strike you immediately and it is at this point that you know you will have fun. The animations and soundtrack are good too, although the latter may start to become annoying after a while – which you can simply turn off if it does.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nWhen it comes to bonus features, the first is the Mystery Bills feature – randomly, any of the 5 banknote symbols can be added to the reels. All notes can be changed into 1 of the note symbol – filling the reels with certain banknote symbols will give you 5, 10, 15, 15, 20, or 50 times your total bet.\n\nThe main attraction is the Monopoly Big Money Reel Spin Bonus feature which is played when any combination of 5 note symbols appears on the reels – you spin a wheel to win cash bonuses up to 250 times your bet, a multiplier boost, or access to 2 other bonus features.\n\nIn the Utility Bonus feature, you start with 2.5 times your bet as credits – then you choose a hand from Mr. Monopoly to reveal the spin, which will make you collect x2. For the spin, you spin the Big Money Reel to win cash prizes and/or multipliers. These continue until you land on Collect or Collect x2 – the latter will double the amount of your win.\n\nFinally, there is the Go Free Spins Bonus feature where you start with 8 free spins – each Go symbol will give you a note symbol that changes all note symbols to that particular note on each free spin. You then get the corresponding prize. With more free spins to be won, you can also win additional cash bonuses.\n\nThe wild will act like any other wild in online slots, substituting all symbols except for those for getting Free Spins. As for the scatter symbols, these, in our opinion, are the most important symbols of the entire online slot. Landing the scatter symbols at least five times on the reels will trigger the ‘Big Money Reel’ bonus game which is so central to this slot. Each of the money bill scatter symbols that have been used will be assigned a multiplier that will stick to them for the duration of the bonus game.\n\nOnce the multipliers have been set, you will be given a random number of spins on the big reel before it starts spinning. All remaining symbols are the highest and lowest-paying standard paying symbols that will award payouts if you find them on paylines at least three times in a row.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nFor those of you who have a really passionate devotion to Monopoly, there are a couple of other WMS titles you may want to look at. \"Monopoly Big Event\" and \"Monopoly Once Around the World\" have both been around longer than Big Reel but have both been hugely successful. The former has 20 paylines and 5 reels, while the latter has 15 paylines and 5 reels.\n\nNeither has the same quality of features as Big Reel, but they are both a lot of fun. In fact, Big Event, with its free spins, multipliers, and low variance, has made it a very popular slot that is still played by many today.\n            ",

Nowadays, it's hard for everyone to take their eyes off their mobile devices long enough to realize they have a family. Many of you will remember the times when you sat around a table, had fun, were competitive, and then cried yourself to sleep when someone else won the game.\n\nWMS, the well-known developers of online gambling software, have now released their latest Monopoly-themed slot game, the free Monopoly Big Money Reel slot, which, judging by first impressions, will be a huge success. Focused on a ‘Monopoly Big Money Reel Bonus Round’ bonus game, this online slot is fully loaded with game features that can be hugely profitable. Check out our review on this impressive online fruit machine with 20 paylines and 5 reels that has excited everyone since its release not long ago. Surely, something special awaits you.\n\nA Familiar Board Game Visual\n\nVisually, Monopoly Big Money Reel is what you’d expect from a Monopoly-themed production – it has a cartoonish style graphics but has a luxurious look. With a very jazzy soundtrack playing as the reels spin, the symbols include classic Monopoly pieces such as thimbles, boots, wheelbarrows, and top hats. You’ll also see automobiles, boats, and planes.\n\nSeemingly stacked, you’ll come across Scotty the dog, a hotel, and Mr. Monopoly himself – the latter being the most rewarding, giving you 7.5 times your bet for 5 on a payline. The diamond-embedded M symbol is the wild and replaces all symbols except for the banknote symbols, namely the 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500.\n\nInitially, you will be very impressed by the apparent quality that has been put into the development of the Monopoly Big Money Reel video slot. The graphics of the online slot, sound effects, and game animations will strike you immediately and it is at this point that you know you will have fun. The animations and soundtrack are good too, although the latter may start to become annoying after a while – which you can simply turn off if it does.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nWhen it comes to bonus features, the first is the Mystery Bills feature – randomly, any of the 5 banknote symbols can be added to the reels. All notes can be changed into 1 of the note symbol – filling the reels with certain banknote symbols will give you 5, 10, 15, 15, 20, or 50 times your total bet.\n\nThe main attraction is the Monopoly Big Money Reel Spin Bonus feature which is played when any combination of 5 note symbols appears on the reels – you spin a wheel to win cash bonuses up to 250 times your bet, a multiplier boost, or access to 2 other bonus features.\n\nIn the Utility Bonus feature, you start with 2.5 times your bet as credits – then you choose a hand from Mr. Monopoly to reveal the spin, which will make you collect x2. For the spin, you spin the Big Money Reel to win cash prizes and/or multipliers. These continue until you land on Collect or Collect x2 – the latter will double the amount of your win.\n\nFinally, there is the Go Free Spins Bonus feature where you start with 8 free spins – each Go symbol will give you a note symbol that changes all note symbols to that particular note on each free spin. You then get the corresponding prize. With more free spins to be won, you can also win additional cash bonuses.\n\nThe wild will act like any other wild in online slots, substituting all symbols except for those for getting Free Spins. As for the scatter symbols, these, in our opinion, are the most important symbols of the entire online slot. Landing the scatter symbols at least five times on the reels will trigger the ‘Big Money Reel’ bonus game which is so central to this slot. Each of the money bill scatter symbols that have been used will be assigned a multiplier that will stick to them for the duration of the bonus game.\n\nOnce the multipliers have been set, you will be given a random number of spins on the big reel before it starts spinning. All remaining symbols are the highest and lowest-paying standard paying symbols that will award payouts if you find them on paylines at least three times in a row.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nFor those of you who have a really passionate devotion to Monopoly, there are a couple of other WMS titles you may want to look at. \"Monopoly Big Event\" and \"Monopoly Once Around the World\" have both been around longer than Big Reel but have both been hugely successful. The former has 20 paylines and 5 reels, while the latter has 15 paylines and 5 reels.\n\nNeither has the same quality of features as Big Reel, but they are both a lot of fun. In fact, Big Event, with its free spins, multipliers, and low variance, has made it a very popular slot that is still played by many today.\n            ",

Nowadays, it's hard for everyone to take their eyes off their mobile devices long enough to realize they have a family. Many of you will remember the times when you sat around a table, had fun, were competitive, and then cried yourself to sleep when someone else won the game.\n\nWMS, the well-known developers of online gambling software, have now released their latest Monopoly-themed slot game, the free Monopoly Big Money Reel slot, which, judging by first impressions, will be a huge success. Focused on a ‘Monopoly Big Money Reel Bonus Round’ bonus game, this online slot is fully loaded with game features that can be hugely profitable. Check out our review on this impressive online fruit machine with 20 paylines and 5 reels that has excited everyone since its release not long ago. Surely, something special awaits you.\n\nA Familiar Board Game Visual\n\nVisually, Monopoly Big Money Reel is what you’d expect from a Monopoly-themed production – it has a cartoonish style graphics but has a luxurious look. With a very jazzy soundtrack playing as the reels spin, the symbols include classic Monopoly pieces such as thimbles, boots, wheelbarrows, and top hats. You’ll also see automobiles, boats, and planes.\n\nSeemingly stacked, you’ll come across Scotty the dog, a hotel, and Mr. Monopoly himself – the latter being the most rewarding, giving you 7.5 times your bet for 5 on a payline. The diamond-embedded M symbol is the wild and replaces all symbols except for the banknote symbols, namely the 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500.\n\nInitially, you will be very impressed by the apparent quality that has been put into the development of the Monopoly Big Money Reel video slot. The graphics of the online slot, sound effects, and game animations will strike you immediately and it is at this point that you know you will have fun. The animations and soundtrack are good too, although the latter may start to become annoying after a while – which you can simply turn off if it does.\n\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\n\nWhen it comes to bonus features, the first is the Mystery Bills feature – randomly, any of the 5 banknote symbols can be added to the reels. All notes can be changed into 1 of the note symbol – filling the reels with certain banknote symbols will give you 5, 10, 15, 15, 20, or 50 times your total bet.\n\nThe main attraction is the Monopoly Big Money Reel Spin Bonus feature which is played when any combination of 5 note symbols appears on the reels – you spin a wheel to win cash bonuses up to 250 times your bet, a multiplier boost, or access to 2 other bonus features.\n\nIn the Utility Bonus feature, you start with 2.5 times your bet as credits – then you choose a hand from Mr. Monopoly to reveal the spin, which will make you collect x2. For the spin, you spin the Big Money Reel to win cash prizes and/or multipliers. These continue until you land on Collect or Collect x2 – the latter will double the amount of your win.\n\nFinally, there is the Go Free Spins Bonus feature where you start with 8 free spins – each Go symbol will give you a note symbol that changes all note symbols to that particular note on each free spin. You then get the corresponding prize. With more free spins to be won, you can also win additional cash bonuses.\n\nThe wild will act like any other wild in online slots, substituting all symbols except for those for getting Free Spins. As for the scatter symbols, these, in our opinion, are the most important symbols of the entire online slot. Landing the scatter symbols at least five times on the reels will trigger the ‘Big Money Reel’ bonus game which is so central to this slot. Each of the money bill scatter symbols that have been used will be assigned a multiplier that will stick to them for the duration of the bonus game.\n\nOnce the multipliers have been set, you will be given a random number of spins on the big reel before it starts spinning. All remaining symbols are the highest and lowest-paying standard paying symbols that will award payouts if you find them on paylines at least three times in a row.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nFor those of you who have a really passionate devotion to Monopoly, there are a couple of other WMS titles you may want to look at. \"Monopoly Big Event\" and \"Monopoly Once Around the World\" have both been around longer than Big Reel but have both been hugely successful. The former has 20 paylines and 5 reels, while the latter has 15 paylines and 5 reels.\n\nNeither has the same quality of features as Big Reel, but they are both a lot of fun. In fact, Big Event, with its free spins, multipliers, and low variance, has made it a very popular slot that is still played by many today.\n        ",
