The Age of the Gods slot is a gem signed by Playtech with its 5 reels and 20 paylines. It has been structured with a series of advantageous features for players, ready to use every opportunity to increase the prestige of their winnings. The gamer will be taken high up, up there in the clouds, to embark on an adventure that can make you fly higher and higher. We will discover below the Pantheon of Power On Reels function, the importance of the role of its wild symbols and all the features that maximize your winnings.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nYou are practically in front of Mount Olympus, alongside the most prestigious deities of Greek tradition. You are facing Athena, the god of the sea Poseidon, Hercules who is the god of war and the inevitable 'king of kings', namely Zeus. And how can we forget the most ruthless of all, Hades, the god of the Underworld. The graphics are well-studied and enriched by a classic soundtrack that does not clash. Among the symbols of lesser value, we find the royal cards A, K and Q and the Scatter and Wild icons, with the latter being able to replace any other symbol to help you facilitate your chances of winning. We also add its secondary power, namely that of offering 2.5, 20, 150 or 500 times your bet if it appears 2, 3, 4 or 5 times in combination.\n\nThe Pantheon of Power On Reels function is activated when the gods are arranged in a row, ready to donate a rich monetary prize. Let's also add 4 free spin functions, a multiplier up to 5x and the power of expanding wilds: Age of the Gods is one of the rare gems of the online gambling sector. There is no doubt! The luckiest will have the chance to try the bonus game with 20 Age of the Gods coins that are activated on the screen: by matching them with the deities and making your choice, you will have the chance to play the free spin function.\n\nThe excellent graphic rendering and animations of the game can be experienced both on desktop and especially on mobile, without losing any type of detail.\n\nFinal considerations on the Age of the Gods slot\n\nIt should be considered that the slot has medium-high volatility and its RTP is fixed at 95.02% although the actual one is stuck at 94.03% with an increase of 0.99% thanks to the jackpot. The value is good especially if we consider the industry average.\n\nOur experience with Age of the Gods is absolutely positive, but we have not yet talked about its 4 progressive jackpots that can be won randomly. If the function is activated, the player is projected onto a 5x4 grid where he has to match 3 symbols to try to win the reference jackpot. If you are lucky enough to get here, you almost automatically have the guarantee of winning at least one jackpot. But getting there won't be easy: are you ready to take the risk?\n            ",

The Age of the Gods slot is a gem signed by Playtech with its 5 reels and 20 paylines. It has been structured with a series of advantageous features for players, ready to use every opportunity to increase the prestige of their winnings. The gamer will be taken high up, up there in the clouds, to embark on an adventure that can make you fly higher and higher. We will discover below the Pantheon of Power On Reels function, the importance of the role of its wild symbols and all the features that maximize your winnings.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nYou are practically in front of Mount Olympus, alongside the most prestigious deities of Greek tradition. You are facing Athena, the god of the sea Poseidon, Hercules who is the god of war and the inevitable 'king of kings', namely Zeus. And how can we forget the most ruthless of all, Hades, the god of the Underworld. The graphics are well-studied and enriched by a classic soundtrack that does not clash. Among the symbols of lesser value, we find the royal cards A, K and Q and the Scatter and Wild icons, with the latter being able to replace any other symbol to help you facilitate your chances of winning. We also add its secondary power, namely that of offering 2.5, 20, 150 or 500 times your bet if it appears 2, 3, 4 or 5 times in combination.\n\nThe Pantheon of Power On Reels function is activated when the gods are arranged in a row, ready to donate a rich monetary prize. Let's also add 4 free spin functions, a multiplier up to 5x and the power of expanding wilds: Age of the Gods is one of the rare gems of the online gambling sector. There is no doubt! The luckiest will have the chance to try the bonus game with 20 Age of the Gods coins that are activated on the screen: by matching them with the deities and making your choice, you will have the chance to play the free spin function.\n\nThe excellent graphic rendering and animations of the game can be experienced both on desktop and especially on mobile, without losing any type of detail.\n\nFinal considerations on the Age of the Gods slot\n\nIt should be considered that the slot has medium-high volatility and its RTP is fixed at 95.02% although the actual one is stuck at 94.03% with an increase of 0.99% thanks to the jackpot. The value is good especially if we consider the industry average.\n\nOur experience with Age of the Gods is absolutely positive, but we have not yet talked about its 4 progressive jackpots that can be won randomly. If the function is activated, the player is projected onto a 5x4 grid where he has to match 3 symbols to try to win the reference jackpot. If you are lucky enough to get here, you almost automatically have the guarantee of winning at least one jackpot. But getting there won't be easy: are you ready to take the risk?\n            ",

The Age of the Gods slot is a gem signed by Playtech with its 5 reels and 20 paylines. It has been structured with a series of advantageous features for players, ready to use every opportunity to increase the prestige of their winnings. The gamer will be taken high up, up there in the clouds, to embark on an adventure that can make you fly higher and higher. We will discover below the Pantheon of Power On Reels function, the importance of the role of its wild symbols and all the features that maximize your winnings.\n\nGraphics and game symbols\n\nYou are practically in front of Mount Olympus, alongside the most prestigious deities of Greek tradition. You are facing Athena, the god of the sea Poseidon, Hercules who is the god of war and the inevitable 'king of kings', namely Zeus. And how can we forget the most ruthless of all, Hades, the god of the Underworld. The graphics are well-studied and enriched by a classic soundtrack that does not clash. Among the symbols of lesser value, we find the royal cards A, K and Q and the Scatter and Wild icons, with the latter being able to replace any other symbol to help you facilitate your chances of winning. We also add its secondary power, namely that of offering 2.5, 20, 150 or 500 times your bet if it appears 2, 3, 4 or 5 times in combination.\n\nThe Pantheon of Power On Reels function is activated when the gods are arranged in a row, ready to donate a rich monetary prize. Let's also add 4 free spin functions, a multiplier up to 5x and the power of expanding wilds: Age of the Gods is one of the rare gems of the online gambling sector. There is no doubt! The luckiest will have the chance to try the bonus game with 20 Age of the Gods coins that are activated on the screen: by matching them with the deities and making your choice, you will have the chance to play the free spin function.\n\nThe excellent graphic rendering and animations of the game can be experienced both on desktop and especially on mobile, without losing any type of detail.\n\nFinal considerations on the Age of the Gods slot\n\nIt should be considered that the slot has medium-high volatility and its RTP is fixed at 95.02% although the actual one is stuck at 94.03% with an increase of 0.99% thanks to the jackpot. The value is good especially if we consider the industry average.\n\nOur experience with Age of the Gods is absolutely positive, but we have not yet talked about its 4 progressive jackpots that can be won randomly. If the function is activated, the player is projected onto a 5x4 grid where he has to match 3 symbols to try to win the reference jackpot. If you are lucky enough to get here, you almost automatically have the guarantee of winning at least one jackpot. But getting there won't be easy: are you ready to take the risk?\n            ",
