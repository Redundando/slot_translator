It was not only their impressive architectural feats that helped ensure their success, but also their ability to tell myths through authors such as Homer. And it is precisely the divine beings that come to life in this slot game, which also boasts fabulous graphics. In fact, the game grid is set between two columns, suspended in the starry sky at the base of the columns. Two large braziers light up the night. The symbols are well-defined, not only the deities, but also the shields with the letters of the Greek alphabet in their centers. The console at the bottom is well-organized, with all the main buttons close at hand.\n\nA relaxing music accompanies every spin, and the mechanical sound of the reels is softened. If we were to rate the entire graphic component, it would undoubtedly be a ten out of ten.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFor this game, BGaming has decided to use a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are variable, and it is up to us how many we activate. The minimum is 1, the maximum is 20. Logically with more active paylines, the chances of obtaining winning combinations increase exponentially. The cost however remains the same, with a minimum of €0.01 and a maximum of €2.5. With the Max Bet button, we can activate the maximum bet all at once, saving time and allowing us to start playing immediately.\n\nThere is the possibility of activating automatic spins, up to a maximum of 1,000 and inserting parameters to stop them autonomously. The volatility is high, and you do not win frequently, but you always get significant figures. The theoretical return to player, or RTP, is generous, at 97.61%.\n\nSymbols and Functionality\n\nThe symbols that are worth less are the shields with the inscriptions of the Greek alphabet inside. Those that pay the most are the deities, with a range that goes from a minimum of 200 times the bet to a maximum of 400, with 5 symbols. Now let's move on to the bonuses.

The success of this culture is not only due to the impressive architectural works, but also and above all to the ability to narrate myths through authors such as Homer. And it is precisely the deities that bring this slot to life, which also has fabulous graphics. In fact, the game grid set between two columns is suspended in the starry sky at the base of the columns. Two large braziers are placed to illuminate the night. The symbols are well defined, not only the deities but also the shields with the Greek alphabet letters in the center. The console at the bottom is well organized, with all the main buttons at hand.\n\nA relaxing music accompanies every spin and the mechanical sound of the reels is muffled. If we had to give a rating to the entire graphic sector, it would undoubtedly be a perfect ten.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFor this game, BGaming has decided to use a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are variable, and we will decide how many to activate. The minimum is 1, the maximum is 20. Of course, with more active lines, the chances of getting winning combinations increase significantly. The cost instead remains the same, with a minimum of €0.01 and a maximum of €2.5. With the Ben Max button, we can activate the maximum bet in one fell swoop, saving time and starting to play immediately.\n\nThere is the possibility of activating automatic spins, up to a maximum of 1,000, and of inserting some parameters to make them stop autonomously. The volatility is high, and you don't win frequently, but you always get significant amounts. The theoretical return to the player, or RTP, is generous, with its 97.61%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nThe symbols that are worth the least are the shields with the inscriptions of the Greek alphabet inside. Those that pay the most are the deities, with a range that goes from a minimum of 200 times the bet to a maximum of 400, assuming you find 5 symbols. Let's move on to the bonuses. The sun with the word Wild in the center is our wild card and, as usual, replaces all symbols except the special ones. Among them is the Scatter, which, besides being paying, also rewards up to a maximum of 10 Free Spins. The Fire Lightning symbol is instead a special symbol that pays very well, up to 1,000 times the bet!\n\nIn Fire Lightning, there is also the Gamble option. In this case, you have to guess the color of the covered card that appears in the center. If you guess it right, you will double the amount of your last win and go ahead with a new opportunity. But if you make a mistake, you will lose the winnings and return to the main game.\n            ",

Players can decide how many paylines to activate to increase their chances of getting winning combinations. The cost remains the same, with a minimum of €0.01 and a maximum of €2.5. With the Ben Max button, players can activate the maximum bet easily and quickly. The game provides an automatic spin feature that allows players to activate up to 1,000 spins with the option of stopping autonomously. The volatility is high, with winning combinations that occur infrequently, but the amounts won are significant.\n\nBet Ranges and Maximum Bet\n\nFire Lightning has a minimum bet of €0.01 and a maximum bet of €2.5. Players can quickly activate the maximum bet with the Ben Max button, reducing the time to start the game. The bet range is suitable for all types of players, from those who prefer placing small bets to those who like to bet high amounts.\n\nSpecial Features and Bonuses\n\nFire Lightning has several special features and bonuses. The sun symbol acts as a wild card and replaces all other symbols except the special ones. The Scatter symbol rewards players with up to 10 Free Spins, and the Fire Lightning symbol pays up to 1,000 times the bet and offers generous payouts. The Gamble option allows players to guess the color of a covered card that appears in the center and double their winnings of the last game. However, if players guess incorrectly, they lose all their winnings and return to the main game.\n\nRTP, Volatility, and Payouts\n\nFire Lightning has a high volatility, meaning that winning combinations occur infrequently, but the amounts won are significant. The theoretical return to the player (RTP) is high with 97.61%, offering players generous payouts. The symbols that pay the most are the deities that provide a range from a minimum of 200 times the bet to a maximum of 400 for five symbols. The shields with the inscriptions of the Greek alphabet inside are the symbols that are worth the least.\n\n        \n            ",

The success of this culture is not only due to the impressive architectural works, but also and above all to the ability to narrate myths through authors such as Homer. And it is precisely the deities that bring this slot to life, which also has fabulous graphics. In fact, the game grid set between two columns is suspended in the starry sky at the base of the columns. Two large braziers are placed to illuminate the night. The symbols are well defined, not only the deities but also the shields with the Greek alphabet letters in the center. The console at the bottom is well organized, with all the main buttons at hand.\n\nA relaxing music accompanies every spin and the mechanical sound of the reels is muffled. If we had to give a rating to the entire graphic sector, it would undoubtedly be a perfect ten.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFor this game, BGaming has decided to use a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are variable, and we will decide how many to activate. The minimum is 1, the maximum is 20. Of course, with more active lines, the chances of getting winning combinations increase significantly. The cost instead remains the same, with a minimum of €0.01 and a maximum of €2.5. With the Ben Max button, we can activate the maximum bet in one fell swoop, saving time and starting to play immediately.\n\nThere is the possibility of activating automatic spins, up to a maximum of 1,000, and of inserting some parameters to make them stop autonomously. The volatility is high, and you don't win frequently, but you always get significant amounts. The theoretical return to the player, or RTP, is generous, with its 97.61%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nThe symbols that are worth the least are the shields with the inscriptions of the Greek alphabet inside. Those that pay the most are the deities, with a range that goes from a minimum of 200 times the bet to a maximum of 400, assuming you find 5 symbols. Let's move on to the bonuses. The sun with the word Wild in the center is our wild card and, as usual, replaces all symbols except the special ones. Among them is the Scatter, which, besides being paying, also rewards up to a maximum of 10 Free Spins. The Fire Lightning symbol is instead a special symbol that pays very well, up to 1,000 times the bet!\n\nIn Fire Lightning, there is also the Gamble option. In this case, you have to guess the color of the covered card that appears in the center. If you guess it right, you will double the amount of your last win and go ahead with a new opportunity. But if you make a mistake, you will lose the winnings and return to the main game.\n            ",

The Fire Lightning symbol is instead a special symbol that pays very well, up to 1,000 times the bet!\n\nIn Fire Lightning, there is also the Gamble option. In this case, you have to guess the color of the covered card that appears in the center. If you guess it right, you will double the amount of your last win and go ahead with a new opportunity.

The success of this culture is not only due to the impressive architectural works, but also and above all to the ability to narrate myths through authors such as Homer. And it is precisely the deities that bring this slot to life, which also has fabulous graphics. In fact, the game grid set between two columns is suspended in the starry sky at the base of the columns. Two large braziers are placed to illuminate the night. The symbols are well defined, not only the deities but also the shields with the Greek alphabet letters in the center. The console at the bottom is well organized, with all the main buttons at hand.\n\nA relaxing music accompanies every spin and the mechanical sound of the reels is muffled. If we had to give a rating to the entire graphic sector, it would undoubtedly be a perfect ten.\n\nSlot Features\n\nFor this game, BGaming has decided to use a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows. The paylines are variable, and we will decide how many to activate. The minimum is 1, the maximum is 20. Of course, with more active lines, the chances of getting winning combinations increase significantly. The cost instead remains the same, with a minimum of €0.01 and a maximum of €2.5. With the Ben Max button, we can activate the maximum bet in one fell swoop, saving time and starting to play immediately.\n\nThere is the possibility of activating automatic spins, up to a maximum of 1,000, and of inserting some parameters to make them stop autonomously. The volatility is high, and you don't win frequently, but you always get significant amounts. The theoretical return to the player, or RTP, is generous, with its 97.61%.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nThe symbols that are worth the least are the shields with the inscriptions of the Greek alphabet inside. Those that pay the most are the deities, with a range that goes from a minimum of 200 times the bet to a maximum of 400, assuming you find 5 symbols. Let's move on to the bonuses. The sun with the word Wild in the center is our wild card and, as usual, replaces all symbols except the special ones. Among them is the Scatter, which, besides being paying, also rewards up to a maximum of 10 Free Spins. The Fire Lightning symbol is instead a special symbol that pays very well, up to 1,000 times the bet!\n\nIn Fire Lightning, there is also the Gamble option. In this case, you have to guess the color of the covered card that appears in the center. If you guess it right, you will double the amount of your last win and go ahead with a new opportunity. But if you make a mistake, you will lose the winnings and return to the main game.\n        ",
