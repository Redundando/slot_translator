            "response": "Book of Thieves Review\n\nWith its high-quality graphics, Book of Thieves is a new title that allows you to experience the thrill of medieval life. As experienced gamblers, we are excited to see Blue Guru Games release a game with a precious book theme.\n\nThe game is set in a dark village where thieving merchants, assassins, and thieves will do anything to acquire an ancient book. The graphics are top-notch with smooth animations and well-drawn symbols. The game takes place at night, with houses illuminated by candlelight visible in the background. In the foreground, the game grid is supported by two statues that add to the mysterious ambiance. When the game is idle, hovering the mouse over any symbol shows its value.\n\nBefore playing Book of Thieves, a bet of at least €0.10 must be placed. With ten pay lines, we spend only €0.01 per line. The game grid has a regular shape, with five reels and three rows. On the third highest reel, there is an additional box that will welcome a symbol after every spin. If we obtain a winning combination with that symbol, it will expand across the entire reel.\n\nWith its medium volatility and an RTP rate of 96.19%, we expect both high and low payouts to occur with equal frequency. The Autoplay feature allows us to trigger five to 200 automatic spins without having to click the Play button every time. The maximum payout is 5,250 times the bet.\n\nIn Book of Thieves, high and low-level symbols are available. Combinations of silver, gold, and copper coins offer the lowest payouts. The dagger and cup pay more, while the four characters offer the highest payouts of all. The Wild symbol replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The scatter is a book. Three scatters trigger the Free Spins, where we see three new positions above the grid instead of just one. Any symbols that land in these positions will expand on the reels when they form a winning combination.\n\nYou can also activate the buy bonus by clicking on the button to the left of the grid. Overall, Book of Thieves is an exciting game with stunning graphics, unique features, and possibilities for big payouts.",

The only one missing was Blue Guru Games, which has made up for it by releasing Book of Thieves onto the market - a game set in a typical medieval village with dark atmospheres. This is where the game's unscrupulous merchants, thieves, and murderers will stop at nothing to get their hands on the ancient book.\nIn terms of graphics, we are facing a high-quality product with smooth animations and well-drawn symbols. The game takes place at night, with houses lit up by candlelight in the background, while the grid is in the foreground, supported on either side by two statues that contribute to creating a mysterious atmosphere. When the game is idle, hovering your mouse cursor over any symbol will reveal its value.\n \nFeatures of Book of Thieves:\nBefore playing Book of Thieves, you must place a bet of at least €0.10. With the 10 paylines, we will be spending just €0.01 per line. The game grid has a regular shape, with 5 reels and 3 rows, although an additional box is placed next to the third reel at the top which will receive a symbol with every spin. If we get a winning combination with that symbol, we will see it expand over the entire reel.\nGiven the average volatility, we expect equal frequency of high and low payments, also due to the RTP rate of 96.19%.\nWith Autoplay, we can activate from 5 to 200 automatic spins without having to click the Play button each time.\nThe maximum payout is 5,250 times the bet.\n \nSymbols and features:\nIn Book of Thieves, we can find both low and high-level symbols. The lowest payouts are achieved with combinations of silver, gold, and copper coins. The dagger and the cup are much more rewarding, although the four characters pay the most. To complete combinations, we can also take advantage of the Wild, which being a joker, replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The book is the Scatter. Three of these symbols allow us to enjoy Free Spins, during which three new positions will appear above the grid instead of one. All symbols that stop in these positions will allow the same symbols on the reels to expand when involved in a winning series.\nThe Bonus can be purchased by clicking the Buy button to the left of the grid.\n            ",

The only one missing was Blue Guru Games, which has made up for it by releasing Book of Thieves onto the market - a game set in a typical medieval village with dark atmospheres. This is where the game's unscrupulous merchants, thieves, and murderers will stop at nothing to get their hands on the ancient book.\nIn terms of graphics, we are facing a high-quality product with smooth animations and well-drawn symbols. The game takes place at night, with houses lit up by candlelight in the background, while the grid is in the foreground, supported on either side by two statues that contribute to creating a mysterious atmosphere. When the game is idle, hovering your mouse cursor over any symbol will reveal its value.\n \nFeatures of Book of Thieves:\nBefore playing Book of Thieves, you must place a bet of at least €0.10. With the 10 paylines, we will be spending just €0.01 per line. The game grid has a regular shape, with 5 reels and 3 rows, although an additional box is placed next to the third reel at the top which will receive a symbol with every spin. If we get a winning combination with that symbol, we will see it expand over the entire reel.\nGiven the average volatility, we expect equal frequency of high and low payments, also due to the RTP rate of 96.19%.\nWith Autoplay, we can activate from 5 to 200 automatic spins without having to click the Play button each time.\nThe maximum payout is 5,250 times the bet.\n \nSymbols and features:\nIn Book of Thieves, we can find both low and high-level symbols. The lowest payouts are achieved with combinations of silver, gold, and copper coins. The dagger and the cup are much more rewarding, although the four characters pay the most. To complete combinations, we can also take advantage of the Wild, which being a joker, replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The book is the Scatter. Three of these symbols allow us to enjoy Free Spins, during which three new positions will appear above the grid instead of one. All symbols that stop in these positions will allow the same symbols on the reels to expand when involved in a winning series.\nThe Bonus can be purchased by clicking the Buy button to the left of the grid.\n            ",
