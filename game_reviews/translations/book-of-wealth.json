This new Mancala Gaming title offers players engaging gameplay with HD graphics and a traditional selection of bonuses. In this review, we'll provide you with all the important information about key game parameters such as RTP and volatility, and you can try its free demo version.\n\nFree Book of Wealth Slot: RTP, Volatility, and Betting\nBook of Wealth slot machine is an adventurous Egyptian-themed online slot with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 10 fixed pay lines. You can bet between €10 and €900 per spin, with a maximum win of up to 1,364 times your bet. This game features bonuses such as Wild and Scatter symbols, expanding symbols, and free spins. An autospin option is available, allowing you to play hands-free on both PC and mobile. If you're a fast player, press the Turbo button to speed up your gameplay.\n\nThis download-free slot has medium volatility with an RTP rate fixed at 95%. Playing a game with medium volatility, you're likely to experience fairly regular wins.\n\nGraphics, Symbolism of Book of Wealth\nBook of Wealth is a visually appealing game. It's carefully designed by Mancala Gaming, which has set the plot in a pyramid delimited by 2 ancient statues and illuminated by fire lamps. In the background, the authentic Egyptian soundtrack adds depth and mystery to the gameplay.\n\nAll symbols on the reels are carefully drawn, including the playing card icons, which are the least profitable. Symbols to watch out for are the signs of Isis, Hathor, Pharaoh, and the Explorer, with payouts for combinations of 2 or more symbols. The Explorer is the real star of the paytable and offers up to 50 times your bet.\n\nThe big book serves as both a Wild and a Scatter symbol in this slot. As Wild, it pays 200 times for 5 identical icons on the reels and also replaces all other symbols. The book also triggers the bonus game when functioning as a scatter and rewards 50 times for 5 symbols scattered anywhere in view.\n\nHow to Get Free Spins Playing Book of Wealth\n\nFree Spins Bonus Feature\nWhen 3 or more scatters appear in any position on the reels, they activate this bonus feature with 10 free games. Before the start of the bonus round, a symbol is chosen to act as an expanding special symbol. If you're lucky enough to get at least 3 books during free spins mode, you'll receive another 10 FS with the same expanding symbol.\n\nExpanding Symbol Feature\nDuring free spins, a special symbol can expand to occupy the entire reel. It pays like normal icons, but also on non-adjacent positions and on all active paylines.\n\nFAQ\nCan I play Book of Wealth for free without registering?\nYes! The Book of Wealth slot machine can be played anytime on Slotjava for free and no download is required! However, there is also a real money version if you prefer.\n\nWhat is the RTP of Book of Wealth?\nThe online slot Book of Wealth has an official RTP of 95% and medium volatility. You can enjoy this or find slots with high RTPs in our updated catalog of free slots.\n\nCan I win a progressive jackpot on the Book of Wealth slot?\nNo, unfortunately you cannot win a progressive jackpot on the Book of Wealth slot, but you can activate other features such as Autoplay, Scatter, and very generous Wilds.\n            ",

As with other video slots, winning combinations can be formed by matching symbols across the reels. Players can choose to spin the reels manually or use the Autoplay feature for hands-free play.\n\nBonuses\n\nThis game offers a traditional selection of bonuses, including Wild and Scatter symbols, expanding symbols, and free spins. The big book serves as both a Wild and a Scatter symbol and triggers the bonus game when functioning as a scatter. During the bonus game, players can receive 10 free games and a special expanding symbol that can pay regular symbols twice over, thereby increasing potential winnings. This slot game does not feature any progressive jackpots.\n\nBet Range\n\nBook of Wealth slot machine allows players to bet between €10 and €900 per spin, making it appealing to both high and low rollers. The maximum payout is up to 1,364 times your bet, making the game potentially lucrative for players who wager larger sums.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe design of Book of Wealth is visually appealing and authentic to the Egyptian theme. The reels are set within a pyramid, flanked by two ancient statues, while the backdrop depicts the vast desert. The graphics are high-quality and include symbols such as the Explorer, Isis, Hathor, and Pharaoh. The game's soundtrack complements the Egyptian theme and adds depth to the gameplay.\n\nFree Spins\n\nBook of Wealth offers a free spins bonus feature triggered by 3 or more Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. Players receive 10 free games and a special expanding symbol is chosen before the start of the bonus round. During free spins, the expanding symbol can occupy the entire reel and pay out like a normal symbol on non-adjacent positions and on all active paylines. If players manage to get at least 3 books during free spins mode, they'll receive another 10 FS with the same expanding symbol.\n\n        \n            ",
