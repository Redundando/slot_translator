Dragon Palace is a video game by Lightning Box that centers around the most iconic and mythical creature of ancient China: the lucky dragon. Tame this fire-breathing beast and make friends if you want to score big in this dynamic and beautiful game. If you think you’ve got what it takes, then we might have some tips to share with you before you start.\n\nVisually, Dragon Palace has a classic look. The setting is an ancient temple guarded by roaring dragons. The symbols on the reels maintain the historical atmosphere. Besides the lower value playing cards, there are high-paying symbols such as a lotus flower, a gold coin, a turtle, a koi carp, and a warrior. If you manage to land five warriors, you’ll win a payout of 1,000 coins.\n\nRead our complete review of Dragon Palace and discover the best ways to enter the dragon's den and come out richer than ever before.\n\nStunning graphics\nDragon Palace relies on its pure graphic quality to impress players as soon as the game launches, and we must admit that it works. Bright colors and clear graphics make a good first impression. As a player, you are facing the gates of the famous Dragon Palace, which contains the reels themselves. The entrance is decorated with statues of golden dragons climbing up to the tiled roof of the structure.\n\nA vast bamboo forest extends beyond the palace, giving a bit of depth to the game. All in all, Dragon Palace manages to captivate players into its fantastic universe within seconds.\n\nVisually, Dragon Palace is quite simple yet very effective. The action takes place on an Asian-style support track that definitely enhances the classic atmosphere. One might think that developers would get tired of creating Chinese-themed slots. It seems there is no end to the appetite for all things Chinese among both developers and players.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nOnce you’ve settled into the unique universe of Dragon Palace, it’s time to learn a bit more about the basic rules of the game, which are pretty simple. The game matrix is a classic 5-reel configuration with three symbol positions on each reel. The generous dragons offer players not less than 243 different ways to win on every spin, as the game does not have any specific pay line. This means all you have to do is align symbol combinations anywhere on the screen to get a cash prize. Simply use the controls below the reels to adjust your bet before clicking the spin button to start the actual game.\n\nThe larger your bet, the bigger the potential rewards. Use the bet max button if you're feeling lucky and want to risk it all on the next spin. Another simple way to add a bit of excitement to Dragon Palace and speed up the whole game is to activate the auto spin mode. The reels will then spin on their own and automatically place your bet for as long as you want.\n\nThe paytable of Dragon Palace contains a decent range of reel symbols, which we can divide into two different groups from the beginning. \n\nThe first group contains low-cost playing card symbols from 9 to Ace. As usual, these very common icons are the symbols that you will see most often during your game, but their combinations will only provide modest rewards.\n\nThings get more interesting with the second group of symbols, which contains a selection of beautiful reel symbols inspired by Chinese culture and folklore. Fish, turtles, lotus flowers, warriors, and so on, all boast superior graphic quality and beautiful animations, not to mention juicy cash rewards for lucky players.\n\nKeep an eye on the dragon during free spins - every time it is part of a winning combination, it increases the win by a multiplier. This figure will be 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or even 15 times the bet, depending on the fire-breathing master dragon. If you land 3 or more palaces during the feature, you can re-trigger it with a potential offer of 40 free spins.\n\nWe found that Dragon Palace is a medium volatility slot - the 243 ways to win game engine (winning combinations are formed when the same symbol lands on adjacent reels rather than on traditional pay lines) keeps the basic gameplay action flowing smoothly.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDragon Palace is not a particularly exotic example of the genre, but it is a good starting point. And if you're lucky with these multipliers, it also offers some nice winning opportunities. To continue on the theme, there are many options with Playtech offering Jade Emperor and Sun Wukong.",

The first group consists of low-cost card symbols from 9 to Ace, while the second group contains a selection of beautiful reel symbols inspired by Chinese culture and folklore, including fish, turtles, lotus flowers, warriors, and more – all boasting a superior graphic quality and catchy animations that are sure to catch your eye and increase your winnings.\n\nDuring free spins, keep an eye on the dragon symbol – every time it is part of a winning combination, it increases the payout by a multiplier, ranging from 2 to 15 times the bet depending on the type of fire-breathing dragon that appears. If you get 3 or more palaces during the function, you can retrieve the function with up to 40 free spins on offer. \n\nWith its 243 ways to win engine, Dragon Palace is a medium volatility slot that delivers smooth and exciting gameplay. While it may not be the most exotic option out there, its potential for big wins with multipliers offers a lot of thrills and has the potential to satisfy any experienced gambler's thirst for Chinese-themed games.

Dragon Palace is a video game by Lightning Box that centers around the most iconic and mythical creature of ancient China: the lucky dragon. Tame this fire-breathing beast and make friends if you want to score big in this dynamic and beautiful game. If you think you’ve got what it takes, then we might have some tips to share with you before you start.\n\nVisually, Dragon Palace has a classic look. The setting is an ancient temple guarded by roaring dragons. The symbols on the reels maintain the historical atmosphere. Besides the lower value playing cards, there are high-paying symbols such as a lotus flower, a gold coin, a turtle, a koi carp, and a warrior. If you manage to land five warriors, you’ll win a payout of 1,000 coins.\n\nRead our complete review of Dragon Palace and discover the best ways to enter the dragon's den and come out richer than ever before.\n\nStunning graphics\nDragon Palace relies on its pure graphic quality to impress players as soon as the game launches, and we must admit that it works. Bright colors and clear graphics make a good first impression. As a player, you are facing the gates of the famous Dragon Palace, which contains the reels themselves. The entrance is decorated with statues of golden dragons climbing up to the tiled roof of the structure.\n\nA vast bamboo forest extends beyond the palace, giving a bit of depth to the game. All in all, Dragon Palace manages to captivate players into its fantastic universe within seconds.\n\nVisually, Dragon Palace is quite simple yet very effective. The action takes place on an Asian-style support track that definitely enhances the classic atmosphere. One might think that developers would get tired of creating Chinese-themed slots. It seems there is no end to the appetite for all things Chinese among both developers and players.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nOnce you’ve settled into the unique universe of Dragon Palace, it’s time to learn a bit more about the basic rules of the game, which are pretty simple. The game matrix is a classic 5-reel configuration with three symbol positions on each reel. The generous dragons offer players not less than 243 different ways to win on every spin, as the game does not have any specific pay line. This means all you have to do is align symbol combinations anywhere on the screen to get a cash prize. Simply use the controls below the reels to adjust your bet before clicking the spin button to start the actual game.\n\nThe larger your bet, the bigger the potential rewards. Use the bet max button if you're feeling lucky and want to risk it all on the next spin. Another simple way to add a bit of excitement to Dragon Palace and speed up the whole game is to activate the auto spin mode. The reels will then spin on their own and automatically place your bet for as long as you want.\n\nThe paytable of Dragon Palace contains a decent range of reel symbols, which we can divide into two different groups from the beginning. \n\nThe first group contains low-cost playing card symbols from 9 to Ace. As usual, these very common icons are the symbols that you will see most often during your game, but their combinations will only provide modest rewards.\n\nThings get more interesting with the second group of symbols, which contains a selection of beautiful reel symbols inspired by Chinese culture and folklore. Fish, turtles, lotus flowers, warriors, and so on, all boast superior graphic quality and beautiful animations, not to mention juicy cash rewards for lucky players.\n\nKeep an eye on the dragon during free spins - every time it is part of a winning combination, it increases the win by a multiplier. This figure will be 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or even 15 times the bet, depending on the fire-breathing master dragon. If you land 3 or more palaces during the feature, you can re-trigger it with a potential offer of 40 free spins.\n\nWe found that Dragon Palace is a medium volatility slot - the 243 ways to win game engine (winning combinations are formed when the same symbol lands on adjacent reels rather than on traditional pay lines) keeps the basic gameplay action flowing smoothly.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDragon Palace is not a particularly exotic example of the genre, but it is a good starting point. And if you're lucky with these multipliers, it also offers some nice winning opportunities.

Dragon Palace is a video game by Lightning Box that centers around the most iconic and mythical creature of ancient China: the lucky dragon. Tame this fire-breathing beast and make friends if you want to score big in this dynamic and beautiful game. If you think you’ve got what it takes, then we might have some tips to share with you before you start.\n\nVisually, Dragon Palace has a classic look. The setting is an ancient temple guarded by roaring dragons. The symbols on the reels maintain the historical atmosphere. Besides the lower value playing cards, there are high-paying symbols such as a lotus flower, a gold coin, a turtle, a koi carp, and a warrior. If you manage to land five warriors, you’ll win a payout of 1,000 coins.\n\nRead our complete review of Dragon Palace and discover the best ways to enter the dragon's den and come out richer than ever before.\n\nStunning graphics\nDragon Palace relies on its pure graphic quality to impress players as soon as the game launches, and we must admit that it works. Bright colors and clear graphics make a good first impression. As a player, you are facing the gates of the famous Dragon Palace, which contains the reels themselves. The entrance is decorated with statues of golden dragons climbing up to the tiled roof of the structure.\n\nA vast bamboo forest extends beyond the palace, giving a bit of depth to the game. All in all, Dragon Palace manages to captivate players into its fantastic universe within seconds.\n\nVisually, Dragon Palace is quite simple yet very effective. The action takes place on an Asian-style support track that definitely enhances the classic atmosphere. One might think that developers would get tired of creating Chinese-themed slots. It seems there is no end to the appetite for all things Chinese among both developers and players.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nOnce you’ve settled into the unique universe of Dragon Palace, it’s time to learn a bit more about the basic rules of the game, which are pretty simple. The game matrix is a classic 5-reel configuration with three symbol positions on each reel. The generous dragons offer players not less than 243 different ways to win on every spin, as the game does not have any specific pay line. This means all you have to do is align symbol combinations anywhere on the screen to get a cash prize. Simply use the controls below the reels to adjust your bet before clicking the spin button to start the actual game.\n\nThe larger your bet, the bigger the potential rewards. Use the bet max button if you're feeling lucky and want to risk it all on the next spin. Another simple way to add a bit of excitement to Dragon Palace and speed up the whole game is to activate the auto spin mode. The reels will then spin on their own and automatically place your bet for as long as you want.\n\nThe paytable of Dragon Palace contains a decent range of reel symbols, which we can divide into two different groups from the beginning. \n\nThe first group contains low-cost playing card symbols from 9 to Ace. As usual, these very common icons are the symbols that you will see most often during your game, but their combinations will only provide modest rewards.\n\nThings get more interesting with the second group of symbols, which contains a selection of beautiful reel symbols inspired by Chinese culture and folklore. Fish, turtles, lotus flowers, warriors, and so on, all boast superior graphic quality and beautiful animations, not to mention juicy cash rewards for lucky players.\n\nKeep an eye on the dragon during free spins - every time it is part of a winning combination, it increases the win by a multiplier. This figure will be 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or even 15 times the bet, depending on the fire-breathing master dragon. If you land 3 or more palaces during the feature, you can re-trigger it with a potential offer of 40 free spins.\n\nWe found that Dragon Palace is a medium volatility slot - the 243 ways to win game engine (winning combinations are formed when the same symbol lands on adjacent reels rather than on traditional pay lines) keeps the basic gameplay action flowing smoothly.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nDragon Palace is not a particularly exotic example of the genre, but it is a good starting point. And if you're lucky with these multipliers, it also offers some nice winning opportunities. To continue on the theme, there are many options with Playtech offering Jade Emperor and Sun Wukong.\n            ",

Dragon Palace is a video game by Lightning Box that centers around the most iconic and mythical creature of ancient China: the lucky dragon. Tame this fire-breathing beast and make friends if you want to score big in this dynamic and beautiful game. If you think you’ve got what it takes, then we might have some tips to share with you before you start.\n\nVisually, Dragon Palace has a classic look. The setting is an ancient temple guarded by roaring dragons. The symbols on the reels maintain the historical atmosphere. Besides the lower value playing cards, there are high-paying symbols such as a lotus flower, a gold coin, a turtle, a koi carp, and a warrior. If you manage to land five warriors, you’ll win a payout of 1,000 coins.\n\nRead our complete review of Dragon Palace and discover the best ways to enter the dragon's den and come out richer than ever before.\n\nStunning graphics\nDragon Palace relies on its pure graphic quality to impress players as soon as the game launches, and we must admit that it works. Bright colors and clear graphics make a good first impression. As a player, you are facing the gates of the famous Dragon Palace, which contains the reels themselves. The entrance is decorated with statues of golden dragons climbing up to the tiled roof of the structure.\n\nA vast bamboo forest extends beyond the palace, giving a bit of depth to the game. All in all, Dragon Palace manages to captivate players into its fantastic universe within seconds.\n\nVisually, Dragon Palace is quite simple yet very effective. The action takes place on an Asian-style support track that definitely enhances the classic atmosphere. One might think that developers would get tired of creating Chinese-themed slots. It seems there is no end to the appetite for all things Chinese among both developers and players.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nOnce you’ve settled into the unique universe of Dragon Palace, it’s time to learn a bit more about the basic rules of the game, which are pretty simple. The game matrix is a classic 5-reel configuration with three symbol positions on each reel. The generous dragons offer players not less than 243 different ways to win on every spin, as the game does not have any specific pay line. This means all you have to do is align symbol combinations anywhere on the screen to get a cash prize. Simply use the controls below the reels to adjust your bet before clicking the spin button to start the actual game.\n\nThe larger your bet, the bigger the potential rewards. Use the bet max button if you're feeling lucky and want to risk it all on the next spin. Another simple way to add a bit of excitement to Dragon Palace and speed up the whole game is to activate the auto spin mode.

Dragon Palace is a video game by Lightning Box that centers around the most iconic and mythical creature of ancient China: the lucky dragon. Tame this fire-breathing beast and make friends if you want to score big in this dynamic and beautiful game. If you think you’ve got what it takes, then we might have some tips to share with you before you start.\n\nVisually, Dragon Palace has a classic look. The setting is an ancient temple guarded by roaring dragons. The symbols on the reels maintain the historical atmosphere. Besides the lower value playing cards, there are high-paying symbols such as a lotus flower, a gold coin, a turtle, a koi carp, and a warrior. If you manage to land five warriors, you’ll win a payout of 1,000 coins.\n\nRead our complete review of Dragon Palace and discover the best ways to enter the dragon's den and come out richer than ever before.\n\nStunning graphics\nDragon Palace relies on its pure graphic quality to impress players as soon as the game launches, and we must admit that it works. Bright colors and clear graphics make a good first impression. As a player, you are facing the gates of the famous Dragon Palace, which contains the reels themselves. The entrance is decorated with statues of golden dragons climbing up to the tiled roof of the structure.\n\nA vast bamboo forest extends beyond the palace, giving a bit of depth to the game. All in all, Dragon Palace manages to captivate players into its fantastic universe within seconds.\n\nVisually, Dragon Palace is quite simple yet very effective. The action takes place on an Asian-style support track that definitely enhances the classic atmosphere. One might think that developers would get tired of creating Chinese-themed slots. It seems there is no end to the appetite for all things Chinese among both developers and players.\n\nFeatures and Symbols of the Slot Machine\nOnce you’ve settled into the unique universe of Dragon Palace, it’s time to learn a bit more about the basic rules of the game, which are pretty simple. The game matrix is a classic 5-reel configuration with three symbol positions on each reel. The generous dragons offer players not less than 243 different ways to win on every spin, as the game does not have any specific pay line. This means all you have to do is align symbol combinations anywhere on the screen to get a cash prize. Simply use the controls below the reels to adjust your bet before clicking the spin button to start the actual game.\n\nThe larger your bet, the bigger the potential rewards. Use the bet max button if you're feeling lucky and want to risk it all on the next spin. Another simple way to add a bit of excitement to Dragon Palace and speed up the whole game is to activate the auto spin mode. The reels will then spin on their own and automatically place your bet for as long as you want.\n\nThe paytable of Dragon Palace contains a decent range of reel symbols, which we can divide into two different groups from the beginning. \n\nThe first group contains low-cost playing card symbols from 9 to Ace. As usual, these very common icons are the symbols that you will see most often during your game, but their combinations will only provide modest rewards.\n\nThings get more interesting with the second group of symbols, which contains a selection of beautiful reel symbols inspired by Chinese culture and folklore. Fish, turtles, lotus flowers, warriors, and so on, all boast superior graphic quality and beautiful animations, not to mention juicy cash rewards for lucky players.\n\nKeep an eye on the dragon during free spins - every time it is part of a winning combination, it increases the win by a multiplier. This figure will be 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or even 15 times the bet, depending on the fire-breathing master dragon.
