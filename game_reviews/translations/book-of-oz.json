Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay mechanics\n\nBook of Oz is a 5x3 slot machine with ten winning lines. The player can choose which reels to spin again after the first spin, as long as they pay the cost of the respin. The slot features Wild and Scatter symbols in the form of books, which can trigger free spins.\n\nSpecial features and bonuses\n\nThe most notable feature in Book of Oz is the respin, which allows players to spin the reels again at a cost to try and obtain a winning combination. The book symbols can act as both Wild and Scatter, and three or more books trigger the free spins feature. During the free spins, a symbol is randomly chosen to act as an expanding symbol, which can increase the chances of a big win.\n\nGraphics and design\n\nBook of Oz features a green and emerald color scheme that evokes the Emerald City from the Wizard of Oz. The symbols are a combination of playing card symbols and elements from the story, such as magic potions. The design is detailed but not overcomplicated, allowing players to focus on the gameplay mechanics.\n\nWizard of Oz theme\n\nBook of Oz is part of the Wizard of Oz themed slots created by Microgaming. The game features references to the story, such as magic potions and the book symbol acting as a nod to the Book of Spells from the story. The emerald green color scheme also fits with the Wizard of Oz theme.\n\nSimilar slots in the industry\n\nThe sequel to Book of Oz, Book of Oz Lock n Spin, shares many of the same features as the original. Other slots with a Wizard of Oz theme include The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and New Wizard of Oz, although these have different gameplay mechanics. \n\n        \n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGame graphics and design\n\nBook of Oz has a unique theme that is well executed through its graphics and design. The predominant color is green, which extends to the various symbols within the game. The symbols include elements of playing cards, such as A, K, Q, and suits like Flowers, Hearts. There are also magic potion symbols that refer to story elements, such as the lion-shaped cap potion that instills courage. The style is detailed yet simple, allowing players to focus exclusively on the game mechanics.\n\nGame mechanics and features\n\nBook of Oz has a classic slot mechanism with a 5x3 grid consisting of five reels with three symbols each and ten winning lines. The most appreciated feature of this game is the respin option where players can choose which reels to spin again to get a winning combination. Each respin has a cost that increases with the possibility of obtaining a combination with a higher value. The books symbol acts as both Wild and Scatter symbols, giving players the possibility to access free spins. Players adopt different strategies, such as rotating the reels only when they find at least two books, minimizing investment costs.\n\nWinning opportunities and lines\n\nBook of Oz has ten winning lines and players can win by forming a winning combination of symbols on the pay lines. The respin feature allows players to increase their chances of winning by spinning specific reels at an added cost. The books symbol acts as both Wild and Scatter symbols, providing players with many opportunities to win. The payout rate of the Book of Oz is quite fair, with an RTP of 96.31%.\n\nWild and Scatter symbols\n\nThe books symbol in the Book of Oz acts as both Wild and Scatter symbols. The Wild symbol replaces all other symbols on the reels, while the Scatter symbol pays in any position. If three or more Scatters land on the reels, players can access the free spins bonus round, where they can win up to 25 free spins. During the free spins round, one symbol is randomly chosen to become an expanding symbol, which can fill the entire reel and boost the chances of winning.\n\nSimilar slots\n\nBook of Oz Lock n Spin, also by Microgaming, is a sequel to Book of Oz. It has similar characteristics to its predecessor but with added Lock n Spin mechanics. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and New Wizard of Oz also share the same theme, although their mechanics are different from that of Book of Oz.\n\n        \n            ",

It's no surprise to see such attention given to this theme, as this literary saga (and the film that followed) is one of the most beloved of all time, although its popularity in Italy has been less widespread than abroad. \n\nThe slot we will be discussing today in our review has very unique features that have made it particularly popular in the industry. Let's not waste any more time and move on to the graphics. \n\nBook of Oz: the emerald city \nJust like in the following chapter, in this slot too, the predominant color is the green that starts from the background and extends to the various symbols inside the game grid. These symbols show many elements of playing cards, both in terms of symbols (A, K, Q...) and in terms of suits (Flowers, hearts...). \n\nIn addition to these, there are other symbols, always in the form of magic potions, which refer to elements of the story, such as the potion with the lion-shaped cap that instills courage. \n\nThe style turns out to be detailed but simple at the same time, so that the player's attention can be focused exclusively on the game mechanics. \n\nBook of Oz: the respin \nOn paper, we are facing a very classic slot, with a 5x3 mechanism that includes five reels that show three symbols each for each game. As with its sequel, here too we have ten winning lines. \n\nThe most appreciated feature of this game is certainly the respin: after spinning the reels once, it is possible to choose whether and which ones to spin again, with the aim of obtaining a winning combination. Each respin has a cost that increases with the possibility of obtaining a combination with a higher value. \n\nOne of the most used strategies in this regard is to minimize the investment of money by rotating the reels only when we have found at least two books. In fact, books play the roles of both Wild symbols and Scatter symbols, giving the possibility to access free spins. \n\nBut of course, this is just one of the applicable techniques and each player finds their personal way of approaching this slot. \n\nSlots similar to Book of Oz \nSpeaking of slots that have similar characteristics, we cannot start our list without the sequel we have already talked about, namely Book of Oz Lock n Spin, also by Microgaming. In addition to this, there are The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and New Wizard of Oz, which, although offering different mechanics, share the same theme.\n        ",
