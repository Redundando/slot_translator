Join the most famous rescue squad in America and don't miss out on the Free Spins and Bonuses during the rounds of this online slot game without registration.\nOur review of the Baywatch slot game\nBaywatch is a slot game without download consisting of 5 reels with 15 paylines that can be played starting from 0.25€ from any device. The game is offered with 2 standard features randomly activated from which precious symbols come out for your winning combinations, with 3 Wild reels for every spin. Also, don't miss out on the two extra features TEAMWORK FEATURE and TIDAL WILDS that we will talk about later, which will appear in every free spin.\nLifeguard symbols\nIn the screen of the free Baywatch slot game, besides the 4 TV show characters, you will find: a Binocular, a 4x4 Jeep, a Yellow Speedboat, the Red Rescue Board, and the Bonus Lifeguard symbol. Mitch represents the most profitable symbol, as it offers you 100 coins for 5 on a payline in the standard game. There's also a Surfing Wave Wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the Bonus Scatter, but only on the central 3 reels.\nBaywatch bonuses and features\nWhen it comes to bonus features, Baywatch offers many features:\n\nTeamwork Feature for symbol substitution - lifeguard symbols are randomly chosen on every standard game spin by various character pairs and then transformed into a combined team symbol for bigger wins;\nTidal Wilds - on every spin, the Wild symbol can randomly expand as a tide to cover the entire reel. Each Wild reel can then expand horizontally to fill 1 or 2 extra reels - this can lead to 3 wild reels on reels 2, 3, and 4;\nFree Spin Bonus - the lifeguard hut at sunset is the Bonus symbol, and if you get one on reels 2, 3, and 4, you will win free spins. You can get 2 times the bet with Bonus cash. Choose 1 male character and 1 female character to create your favorite lifeguard couple and find out the number of free spins you will play.\n\nWhat we think\nPlaying IGT's free Baywatch slot game, we realized its average volatility with a maximum win offer of 150 times the bet per spin. Overall, the game is fun with some features, such as the Free Spins Bonus, that make the gameplay very dynamic. If you're not a fan of this TV series, we recommend checking out our library of IGT online slots to discover the many titles available to play in both demo mode and with real money.\n            ",

Join the most famous rescue squad in America and don't miss out on the Free Spins and Bonuses during the rounds of this online slot game without registration.\nOur review of the Baywatch slot game\nBaywatch is a slot game without download consisting of 5 reels with 15 paylines that can be played starting from 0.25€ from any device. The game is offered with 2 standard features randomly activated from which precious symbols come out for your winning combinations, with 3 Wild reels for every spin. Also, don't miss out on the two extra features TEAMWORK FEATURE and TIDAL WILDS that we will talk about later, which will appear in every free spin.\nLifeguard symbols\nIn the screen of the free Baywatch slot game, besides the 4 TV show characters, you will find: a Binocular, a 4x4 Jeep, a Yellow Speedboat, the Red Rescue Board, and the Bonus Lifeguard symbol. Mitch represents the most profitable symbol, as it offers you 100 coins for 5 on a payline in the standard game. There's also a Surfing Wave Wild symbol that replaces all symbols except the Bonus Scatter, but only on the central 3 reels.\nBaywatch bonuses and features\nWhen it comes to bonus features, Baywatch offers many features:\n\nTeamwork Feature for symbol substitution - lifeguard symbols are randomly chosen on every standard game spin by various character pairs and then transformed into a combined team symbol for bigger wins;\nTidal Wilds - on every spin, the Wild symbol can randomly expand as a tide to cover the entire reel. Each Wild reel can then expand horizontally to fill 1 or 2 extra reels - this can lead to 3 wild reels on reels 2, 3, and 4;\nFree Spin Bonus - the lifeguard hut at sunset is the Bonus symbol, and if you get one on reels 2, 3, and 4, you will win free spins. You can get 2 times the bet with Bonus cash. Choose 1 male character and 1 female character to create your favorite lifeguard couple and find out the number of free spins you will play.\n\nWhat we think\nPlaying IGT's free Baywatch slot game, we realized its average volatility with a maximum win offer of 150 times the bet per spin. Overall, the game is fun with some features, such as the Free Spins Bonus, that make the gameplay very dynamic. If you're not a fan of this TV series, we recommend checking out our library of IGT online slots to discover the many titles available to play in both demo mode and with real money.\n            ",
