This is the Magic Stars 3 slot by Wazdan, with a top symbolic payout of 400x and potential multiple wins of 80x and 40x. Play the game on its always-active paylines with bets starting at a minimum of 0.10 per spin. The game's theoretical return to player is 96.50%.\nStellar Graphics\nDiscover a three-reel, five-payline slot game with stars as symbols - this is the Magic Stars 3 slot, with a payout of 400x for symbols. We have a brand new game from slot experts at Wazdan, released in the second half of 2019. It features three reels and five always-active paylines, which seems to be part of the three-reel slot craze of 2019. This is a suitable addition to the game list with such a set of reels. Just like the Starburst slot, the Magic Stars slot is characterized by stars for its symbols.\nIn addition to classic reel action, Magic Stars also has a wild symbol that replaces any other symbol and a set of symbols that are stars of different colors. There is also a gambling feature, and players have the option to set the volatility between low, medium and high options. The reel action starts with the press of the Spin button, but before doing so, we should check the default bet and maybe choose an amount that suits our play style.\nSlot Machine Features and Symbols\nWinning at any slot game is always a matter of luck. The random number generator that is part of every slot game is only able to provide winning or losing results completely randomly. That said, we can consider the symbol payout and other possible winning results in the Magic Stars 3 slots.\nThe game's most valuable symbol is the wild, which is represented by a multicolored starry sun. Landing three of these on a payline equals 400x multiplied by the line bet. The wild is followed by the green, red, blue and yellow stars, all paying 80x when three land on a payline.\nThose non-shining stars that also come in green, red, blue and yellow pay the same amount of 40x for three on a payline.\nBoth winning combinations can occur on more than one payline. So if three matching symbols land on two or three or more paylines, the Magic Stars 3 will pay out many winning combinations.\nFor a quick look at each symbol payout, players don't need to click on the payline. Clicking or tapping the stars themselves will display their value for a line of three matching symbols.\nThis game does not offer any bonus features. In addition to the wild symbol that can replace any symbol on the reels, and which brings the most lucrative payout, the Magic 3 Stars slot does not have a bonus or scatter symbol. However, there are two special symbols - a green sphere and a yellow sphere full of stars, which represent the Lucky Star symbols that can double winnings.\nA part of the game that can be considered an addition is the gambling feature. After winning any symbol, the player can choose to gamble by selecting one of the options above the Spin button.\nOther Similar Slot Machines\nYou should know that Wazdan, the software provider behind Magic Stars 3, has also produced other similar slot machines. If this slot has piqued your interest for its traditional gambling function and its graphics, we recommend betting your money on Magic Stars 6 as well, with a slightly higher RTP and therefore a greater chance of making a lot of money.",

This is the Slot Magic Stars 3, brought to you by Wazdan, with a Top Pay Symbol of 400x and Potentially Multiple Wins of 80x and 40x. Play the Game on Its Always Active Paylines with Bets Starting at a Minimum of 0.10 per Spin. The Game's Theoretical Return to Player is 96.50%.\n\nA Stellar Graphics\nDiscover a Three Reels and Five Paylines Slot Game with Stars as Symbols - This is the Magic Stars 3 Slot Game, with a Pay Out of 400x for Symbols. This brand-new game comes from the slot game experts at Wazdan, dropping in the second half of 2019. It features three reels and five always active paylines, fitting in with the trend of three-reel slot games that has continued through 2019. It is an appropriate addition to the list of games that have such a set of reels. Just like the Slot Starburst, the Magic Stars Slot is characterized by stars for its symbols.\n\nIn addition to the classic reel-action, Magic Stars also has a Wild Symbol that replaces any other and a set of symbols that are stars of various colors. There is also a gambling feature and players have the chance to set the volatility between low, medium, and high options. The reel action begins with the press of the Spin button, but before doing so, we should check the default bet and perhaps choose an amount that suits our gambling style.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nWinning at any Slot game is always a matter of luck. The random number generator that is part of every Slot game is capable of providing winning or losing results only in a completely random way. That said, we can consider the pay symbol and other possibilities for winning results on the Magic Stars 3 Slot.\n\nThe most valuable symbol of the game is the Wild, which is represented by a multi-colored starry sun. Landing three of these on a payline equals 400x multiplied by the line bet. The Wild is followed by green, red, blue and yellow stars, all paying 80x when three occur on a payline.\n\nThose non-luminous stars that also come in green, red, blue, and yellow colors pay the same amount of 40x for three on a payline. Both winning combinations may occur on more than a single payline. So, if three matching symbols land on two or three or more paylines, the Magic Stars 3 will pay out many winning combinations.\n\nFor a quick look at each pay symbol, players do not need to click on the payline. By clicking or tapping on the stars themselves, they will display their value for a payline of three matching symbols.\n\nThis game does not offer any bonus features. In addition to the Wild symbol that can replace any symbol on the reels, and which brings the most lucrative payout, the Magic Stars 3 Slot has no bonus or scatter symbol. There are two special symbols, however - a green sphere and a yellow sphere full of stars, which represent the Lucky Star symbols, which can double wins.\n\nA part of the game that can be considered an addition is the Gamble feature. After winning any symbol, the player can choose to gamble by selecting one of the options above the Spin button.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nYou should know that Wazdan, the software producer that brought Magic Stars 3 to life, has also produced other similar Slot Machines. If this Slot has fascinated you for its traditional Gamble function and its graphics, then we recommend betting your money on Magic Stars 6 as well, with a slightly higher RTP and consequently a greater chance of making a lot of money.\n        ",

It features three reels and five always active paylines, fitting in with the trend of three-reel slot games that has continued through 2019. It is an appropriate addition to the list of games that have such a set of reels. Just like the Slot Starburst, the Magic Stars Slot is characterized by stars for its symbols.\n\nIn addition to the classic reel-action, Magic Stars also has a Wild Symbol that replaces any other and a set of symbols that are stars of various colors. There is also a gambling feature and players have the chance to set the volatility between low, medium, and high options. The reel action begins with the press of the Spin button, but before doing so, we should check the default bet and perhaps choose an amount that suits our gambling style.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nWinning at any Slot game is always a matter of luck. The random number generator that is part of every Slot game is capable of providing winning or losing results only in a completely random way. That said, we can consider the pay symbol and other possibilities for winning results on the Magic Stars 3 Slot.\n\nThe most valuable symbol of the game is the Wild, which is represented by a multi-colored starry sun. Landing three of these on a payline equals 400x multiplied by the line bet. The Wild is followed by green, red, blue and yellow stars, all paying 80x when three occur on a payline.\n\nThose non-luminous stars that also come in green, red, blue, and yellow colors pay the same amount of 40x for three on a payline. Both winning combinations may occur on more than a single payline. So, if three matching symbols land on two or three or more paylines, the Magic Stars 3 will pay out many winning combinations.\n\nFor a quick look at each pay symbol, players do not need to click on the payline. By clicking or tapping on the stars themselves, they will display their value for a payline of three matching symbols.\n\nThis game does not offer any bonus features. In addition to the Wild symbol that can replace any symbol on the reels, and which brings the most lucrative payout, the Magic Stars 3 Slot has no bonus or scatter symbol. There are two special symbols, however - a green sphere and a yellow sphere full of stars, which represent the Lucky Star symbols, which can double wins.\n\nA part of the game that can be considered an addition is the Gamble feature. After winning any symbol, the player can choose to gamble by selecting one of the options above the Spin button.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nYou should know that Wazdan, the software producer that brought Magic Stars 3 to life, has also produced other similar Slot Machines. If this Slot has fascinated you for its traditional Gamble function and its graphics, then we recommend betting your money on Magic Stars 6 as well, with a slightly higher RTP and consequently a greater chance of making a lot of money.\n            ",

Players can enjoy smooth gameplay and stunning graphics, with stars as the main symbols.\n\nSymbols and Payouts\n\nThe Wild symbol, represented by a multi-colored starry sun, is the most valuable symbol in Magic Stars 3. Landing three of these on a payline equals 400x multiplied by the line bet. The green, red, blue and yellow stars pay 80x when three occur on a payline, while the non-luminous stars of the same colors pay 40x. Multiple winning combinations can occur on more than one payline.\n\nVolatility and Gambling Feature\n\nPlayers have the option to set the game volatility between low, medium, and high options. Magic Stars 3 also offers a gambling feature where players can double their winnings by selecting one of the options above the Spin button.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nApart from the Wild symbol, Magic Stars 3 has two special symbols - a green sphere and a yellow sphere full of stars, which represent the Lucky Star symbols and can double wins.\n\nBonus Features and Similar Games\n\nMagic Stars 3 does not offer any bonus or scatter symbol, but the game has a higher than average theoretical return to player of 96.50%. Wazdan, the software producer of Magic Stars 3, also offers similar slot machines such as Magic Stars 6 with a higher RTP.\n\n        \n            ",

It features a gambling feature and players can set the volatility between low, medium, and high options. Players can check the default bet and choose an amount suitable for their gambling style to start the reel action.\n\nPayouts and Paylines\n\nThe most valuable symbol in Magic Stars 3 is the wild symbol, which is represented by a multi-colored starry sun. Landing three of these on a payline equals a payout of 400x multiplied by the line bet. The wild is followed by green, red, blue, and yellow stars, all paying 80x when three occur on a payline. Non-luminous stars that also come in green, red, blue, and yellow colors pay the same amount of 40x for three on a payline. Both winning combinations may occur on more than a single payline.\n\nVolatility Options\n\nPlayers can set the volatility of Magic Stars 3 according to their preference - low, medium, or high. This option gives players a chance to control their gambling experience by selecting the level of risk to take on.\n\nLucky Star Symbols\n\nMagic Stars 3 has two special symbols - a green sphere and a yellow sphere full of stars, which represent the Lucky Star symbols. These symbols can double wins, adding excitement and an extra opportunity to win big.\n\nOther Wazdan Slot Machines\n\nWazdan, the software producer that brought Magic Stars 3 to life, has also produced other similar slot machines. For players who enjoyed Magic Stars 3, we recommend trying Magic Stars 6, which has a slightly higher RTP and consequently a greater chance of making a lot of money.\n\n        \n            ",

This is the Slot Magic Stars 3, brought to you by Wazdan, with a Top Pay Symbol of 400x and Potentially Multiple Wins of 80x and 40x. Play the Game on Its Always Active Paylines with Bets Starting at a Minimum of 0.10 per Spin. The Game's Theoretical Return to Player is 96.50%.\n\nA Stellar Graphics\nDiscover a Three Reels and Five Paylines Slot Game with Stars as Symbols - This is the Magic Stars 3 Slot Game, with a Pay Out of 400x for Symbols. This brand-new game comes from the slot game experts at Wazdan, dropping in the second half of 2019. It features three reels and five always active paylines, fitting in with the trend of three-reel slot games that has continued through 2019. It is an appropriate addition to the list of games that have such a set of reels. Just like the Slot Starburst, the Magic Stars Slot is characterized by stars for its symbols.\n\nIn addition to the classic reel-action, Magic Stars also has a Wild Symbol that replaces any other and a set of symbols that are stars of various colors. There is also a gambling feature and players have the chance to set the volatility between low, medium, and high options. The reel action begins with the press of the Spin button, but before doing so, we should check the default bet and perhaps choose an amount that suits our gambling style.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nWinning at any Slot game is always a matter of luck. The random number generator that is part of every Slot game is capable of providing winning or losing results only in a completely random way. That said, we can consider the pay symbol and other possibilities for winning results on the Magic Stars 3 Slot.\n\nThe most valuable symbol of the game is the Wild, which is represented by a multi-colored starry sun. Landing three of these on a payline equals 400x multiplied by the line bet. The Wild is followed by green, red, blue and yellow stars, all paying 80x when three occur on a payline.\n\nThose non-luminous stars that also come in green, red, blue, and yellow colors pay the same amount of 40x for three on a payline. Both winning combinations may occur on more than a single payline. So, if three matching symbols land on two or three or more paylines, the Magic Stars 3 will pay out many winning combinations.\n\nFor a quick look at each pay symbol, players do not need to click on the payline. By clicking or tapping on the stars themselves, they will display their value for a payline of three matching symbols.\n\nThis game does not offer any bonus features. In addition to the Wild symbol that can replace any symbol on the reels, and which brings the most lucrative payout, the Magic Stars 3 Slot has no bonus or scatter symbol. There are two special symbols, however - a green sphere and a yellow sphere full of stars, which represent the Lucky Star symbols, which can double wins.\n\nA part of the game that can be considered an addition is the Gamble feature. After winning any symbol, the player can choose to gamble by selecting one of the options above the Spin button.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nYou should know that Wazdan, the software producer that brought Magic Stars 3 to life, has also produced other similar Slot Machines. If this Slot has fascinated you for its traditional Gamble function and its graphics, then we recommend betting your money on Magic Stars 6 as well, with a slightly higher RTP and consequently a greater chance of making a lot of money.\n            ",

This is the Slot Magic Stars 3, brought to you by Wazdan, with a Top Pay Symbol of 400x and Potentially Multiple Wins of 80x and 40x. Play the Game on Its Always Active Paylines with Bets Starting at a Minimum of 0.10 per Spin. The Game's Theoretical Return to Player is 96.50%.\n\nA Stellar Graphics\nDiscover a Three Reels and Five Paylines Slot Game with Stars as Symbols - This is the Magic Stars 3 Slot Game, with a Pay Out of 400x for Symbols. This brand-new game comes from the slot game experts at Wazdan, dropping in the second half of 2019. It features three reels and five always active paylines, fitting in with the trend of three-reel slot games that has continued through 2019. It is an appropriate addition to the list of games that have such a set of reels. Just like the Slot Starburst, the Magic Stars Slot is characterized by stars for its symbols.\n\nIn addition to the classic reel-action, Magic Stars also has a Wild Symbol that replaces any other and a set of symbols that are stars of various colors. There is also a gambling feature and players have the chance to set the volatility between low, medium, and high options. The reel action begins with the press of the Spin button, but before doing so, we should check the default bet and perhaps choose an amount that suits our gambling style.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols\nWinning at any Slot game is always a matter of luck. The random number generator that is part of every Slot game is capable of providing winning or losing results only in a completely random way. That said, we can consider the pay symbol and other possibilities for winning results on the Magic Stars 3 Slot.\n\nThe most valuable symbol of the game is the Wild, which is represented by a multi-colored starry sun. Landing three of these on a payline equals 400x multiplied by the line bet. The Wild is followed by green, red, blue and yellow stars, all paying 80x when three occur on a payline.\n\nThose non-luminous stars that also come in green, red, blue, and yellow colors pay the same amount of 40x for three on a payline. Both winning combinations may occur on more than a single payline. So, if three matching symbols land on two or three or more paylines, the Magic Stars 3 will pay out many winning combinations.\n\nFor a quick look at each pay symbol, players do not need to click on the payline. By clicking or tapping on the stars themselves, they will display their value for a payline of three matching symbols.\n\nThis game does not offer any bonus features. In addition to the Wild symbol that can replace any symbol on the reels, and which brings the most lucrative payout, the Magic Stars 3 Slot has no bonus or scatter symbol. There are two special symbols, however - a green sphere and a yellow sphere full of stars, which represent the Lucky Star symbols, which can double wins.\n\nA part of the game that can be considered an addition is the Gamble feature. After winning any symbol, the player can choose to gamble by selecting one of the options above the Spin button.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nYou should know that Wazdan, the software producer that brought Magic Stars 3 to life, has also produced other similar Slot Machines. If this Slot has fascinated you for its traditional Gamble function and its graphics, then we recommend betting your money on Magic Stars 6 as well, with a slightly higher RTP and consequently a greater chance of making a lot of money.\n        ",
