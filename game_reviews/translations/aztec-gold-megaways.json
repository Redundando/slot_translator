The betting range for this new game is not particularly wide: it starts from a minimum bet of €0.20 to a maximum total bet of €20.\nAztec Gold Megaways does not have a particularly complex gameplay, but its special feature, Aztec Gold Cash Respins, allows players to win up to 1000 times their bet by collecting all the Scatter symbols that appear on the reels.\nAztec Gold Megaways borrows the innovative mechanism produced by Big Time Gaming, giving a technologically advanced game that allows for more symbols per reel during a game, thus increasing the chances of winning.\n\nSymbols of Aztec Gold Megaways:\nThe symbols of Aztec Gold Megaways, as often happens in many slot games, are divided into thematic and non-thematic symbols. Obviously, the non-thematic symbols are those that reproduce the numbers and letters corresponding to the playing cards, this time from 9 to Ace, which are also the symbols with the lowest value among them.\nThe thematic symbols, on the other hand, are represented by animals, including the leopard, the falcon, the snake, as well as the effigy of an Aztec deity. The latter is the symbol that has the highest value of all, giving a win equal to 50 times the bet when it appears on all six reels.\nThere is also a Wild symbol that acts as a wildcard and can replace all other symbols in completing a winning combination, and a Scatter symbol, which is the protagonist of one of Aztec Gold Megaways' special features.\n\nOther Mayan-themed slots:\nAs already mentioned, the Mesoamerican cultures theme is quite developed in the world of slot machines and, even if it may seem unoriginal, it has given us some truly memorable games!\nThe most famous one is undoubtedly Book of Maya by Novomatic, designed along the lines of the even more famous Book of Ra (Ancient Egypt theme).\nVery beautiful and exciting is also Mayan Temple Revenge, a slot machine set in a wild and uncontaminated jungle where we can find ancient Mayan temples.\nFinally, we mention Mayan Temple Advance by Capecod, a very adventurous game that takes place in the jungles of Central America during the time of the conquistadors.\nIn addition to those mentioned above, there are numerous other Mayan-themed slots, among which you will surely find the one that best suits your needs.\n            ",
