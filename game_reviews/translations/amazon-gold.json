Per questo, puoi usare Giri Gratis e fino a 10x moltiplicatori Wild combinati e i vari Scatter sparsi sui rulli. Mi piace molto l’impostazione dell’RTP tarata al 96,54%, in questo modo infatti la partita può diventare davvero interessante!

Amazon Gold's free slot game will bring you face to face with parrots, crocodiles, leopards, monkeys, snakes, butterflies, royal symbols, and gold nuggets. So what are you waiting for? Dive into the thick vegetation of this unusual jungle!\n\nWhat makes Amazon Gold's non-downloadable slot game so exciting? For starters, the game has five three-by reels and presents 30 active paylines with a fixed layout. The game has the potential for high rewards, up to 10,000 times your initial bet with a possible final jackpot of €480,000. For this, you can use Free Spins and up to 10x Wild multipliers combined with various Scatters spread across the reels. I love the setup of the 96.54% calibrated RTP as this makes the game truly fascinating! You can place bets on the 30-slot lines starting at €1.20 per spin up to the limit of €48.00.\n\nWhen does the game become more exciting? In this game, the symbols that appear on the reels can make all the difference, let's take a look:\n\nWith the colorful Parrot Wild stacked on reels 3, 4, or 5, you can replace other standard icons and create interesting winning combinations, but only for paid spins;\nThe White-Beaked Parrot, on the other hand, which appears on reels 2 and 4, activates a multiplier;\nThe Amazon Gold logo is the Scatter, a symbol that must appear at least three times to activate 10 free spins. If the function restarts, you win an additional five rounds.\n\nWarning! The 2nd Wild reel can increase winnings by 1x or 2x, while the version on the 4th reel has multipliers of 1x or 5x. Together, they multiply each other and can help you win even more, up to 10 times your initial bet.\n\nHow will our casino players welcome this new online slot?
