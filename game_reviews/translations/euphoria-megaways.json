The provider has focused more on substance than aesthetics, creating a flawless gameplay, but lacking in terms of graphics. This doesn't mean it's unappealing to the eye, but only that the symbols have simple lines without too many special effects.\n\nThe grid is located in the center of the screen and in the upper frame has stars that will welcome the multipliers during the special feature.

As in the vast majority of slot games, even here the playing cards from 9 to Ace pay less than all the other symbols, while the precious gems generate more substantial wins.\n\nThe Wild is the first of the special symbols, it covers the function of a wild card and replaces all the basic symbols but not the other special ones.\n\nThe word Euphoria is our Scatter and depending on the number landed during a spin, rewards with a number of Free Spins ranging from 8 to 14.\n\nThen there is the mystery symbol, which transforms into a paying symbol, and the star, which always appears accompanied by a multiplier.\n\nThe red Euphoria word is another Scatter.

The provider has focused more on substance than aesthetics, creating a flawless gameplay, but lacking in terms of graphics. This doesn't mean it's unappealing to the eye, but only that the symbols have simple lines without too many special effects.\n\nThe grid is located in the center of the screen and in the upper frame has stars that will welcome the multipliers during the special feature. On the right there are three buttons (Start, Bet and Autoplay), on the left there is the button to buy the various bonus games. The music is relaxing with spiritual tones that match the mood of the game.\n\nFeatures of Euphoria Megaways\n\nThe grid has 6 reels and variable rows, as each spin can accommodate from two to seven symbols. Each time we start the reels, the number of ways to win is indicated in the box on the left. The maximum is an impressive 117,649 ways. The minimum bet is €0.20, an affordable cost that makes the game appealing even for those who are looking for some fun without the intention of breaking the bank. The maximum win is 10,000 times the bet.\n\nFrom 5 to 1,000 automatic spins can be activated, but first it is necessary to set the win and loss limits beyond which the function will stop, returning us to manual mode.\n\nThe game has an RTP of 96% and high volatility.\n\nHow to Win at Euphoria Megaways\n\nThis game uses the cascading system, which means that after every winning combo, the winning symbols are removed and replaced by entirely new ones.\n\nLet's now see the value of the symbols. As in the vast majority of slot games, even here the playing cards from 9 to Ace pay less than all the other symbols, while the precious gems generate more substantial wins.\n\nThe Wild is the first of the special symbols, it covers the function of a wild card and replaces all the basic symbols but not the other special ones.\n\nThe word Euphoria is our Scatter and depending on the number landed during a spin, rewards with a number of Free Spins ranging from 8 to 14.\n\nThen there is the mystery symbol, which transforms into a paying symbol, and the star, which always appears accompanied by a multiplier.\n\nThe red Euphoria word is another Scatter. If at least one appears in the company of the blue Scatter, the Super Free Spins function is activated, thanks to multipliers and other bonuses, giving mind-boggling amounts and additional free spins!\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I play on my smartphone?\n\nThanks to HTML5 technology, Euphoria Megaways runs smoothly on any mobile device.\n\nCan I try the slot before betting real money?\n\nCertainly, Euphoria Megaways can be tested for free on our website.\n\nHow can I get Free Spins?\n\nTo get Free Spins or Super Free Spins, at least three Scatters must land on the reels. Alternatively, you can buy the feature through the BUY button on the grid. \n\nGet ready for an exciting journey through space with Euphoria Megaways, where you can win big and enjoy a relaxing and immersive gaming experience.\n            ",

The provider has focused more on substance than aesthetics, creating a flawless gameplay, but lacking in terms of graphics. This doesn't mean it's unappealing to the eye, but only that the symbols have simple lines without too many special effects.\n\nThe grid is located in the center of the screen and in the upper frame has stars that will welcome the multipliers during the special feature. On the right there are three buttons (Start, Bet and Autoplay), on the left there is the button to buy the various bonus games. The music is relaxing with spiritual tones that match the mood of the game.\n\nFeatures of Euphoria Megaways\n\nThe grid has 6 reels and variable rows, as each spin can accommodate from two to seven symbols. Each time we start the reels, the number of ways to win is indicated in the box on the left. The maximum is an impressive 117,649 ways. The minimum bet is €0.20, an affordable cost that makes the game appealing even for those who are looking for some fun without the intention of breaking the bank. The maximum win is 10,000 times the bet.\n\nFrom 5 to 1,000 automatic spins can be activated, but first it is necessary to set the win and loss limits beyond which the function will stop, returning us to manual mode.\n\nThe game has an RTP of 96% and high volatility.\n\nHow to Win at Euphoria Megaways\n\nThis game uses the cascading system, which means that after every winning combo, the winning symbols are removed and replaced by entirely new ones.\n\nLet's now see the value of the symbols. As in the vast majority of slot games, even here the playing cards from 9 to Ace pay less than all the other symbols, while the precious gems generate more substantial wins.\n\nThe Wild is the first of the special symbols, it covers the function of a wild card and replaces all the basic symbols but not the other special ones.\n\nThe word Euphoria is our Scatter and depending on the number landed during a spin, rewards with a number of Free Spins ranging from 8 to 14.\n\nThen there is the mystery symbol, which transforms into a paying symbol, and the star, which always appears accompanied by a multiplier.\n\nThe red Euphoria word is another Scatter. If at least one appears in the company of the blue Scatter, the Super Free Spins function is activated, thanks to multipliers and other bonuses, giving mind-boggling amounts and additional free spins!\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I play on my smartphone?\n\nThanks to HTML5 technology, Euphoria Megaways runs smoothly on any mobile device.\n\nCan I try the slot before betting real money?\n\nCertainly, Euphoria Megaways can be tested for free on our website.\n\nHow can I get Free Spins?\n\nTo get Free Spins or Super Free Spins, at least three Scatters must land on the reels. Alternatively, you can buy the feature through the BUY button on the grid. \n\nGet ready for an exciting journey through space with Euphoria Megaways, where you can win big and enjoy a relaxing and immersive gaming experience.\n            ",
