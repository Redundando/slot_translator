È presente lo Scatter, una nota musicale, che in questo gioco non regala solamente un numero variabile di giri gratuiti, ma offre anche dei moltiplicatori da x2 a x50.\nNel menù di Beetle Mania Deluxe si può trovare la tabella dei pagamenti, con indicato il valore di ciascun simbolo e i vari pagamenti in base al numero delle volte in cui compare sui rulli.\nFunzioni speciali e gioco bonus di Beetle Mania Deluxe\nQuando sui rulli compaiono tre simboli Scatter (la nota musicale), si ha accesso automatico al gioco bonus Free Spins, che regala 10 giri gratuiti. Durante gli Free Spins entra in gioco un altro simbolo, la coccinella, che raddoppierà le vincite mantenendo il suo ruolo di animale portafortuna.\nCome da tradizione in casa Novomatic, in seguito a una vincita di qualsiasi importo è possibile giocare con la funzione Gamble, un gioco extra con modalità lascia o raddoppia.\nSulla schermata di gioco comparirà una carta girata della quale si dovrà indovinare il colore, rosso o nero: in caso di scommessa esatta si vedrà raddoppiato l’importo della vincita, mentre se la scommessa è sbagliata si perderà tutto.\n",

Beetle Mania Deluxe falls into the latter category, its theme centered on insects depicted in a cartoonish style and coupled with music. The game's grid is set against a stage with musical instruments in the background, with paylines indicated on the side of the reels and game settings at the bottom where players can set the number of lines to bet on, the number of coins, and their respective values. There is also an Autoplay button that can be used to spin the reels automatically for a pre-determined number of spins (up to 1,000) or until the \"Stop\" button is pressed. \n\nThe betting range for this slot is decent at €0.02 to €50, but the return to player (RTP) is a slightly disappointing 94.19%. The symbols on the reels include cute insects alongside numbers and letters that correspond to playing cards from 10 to Ace. The smiling snail, grumpy caterpillar, and yellow butterfly are the regular symbols, while there are three special symbols: the bee is the Wild, which acts as a joker by substituting for all other symbols except for the Scatter and Bonus symbols, to complete a winning combination; the Scatter is a musical note offering not only a variable number of free spins but also multipliers from x2 to x50; and the Bonus symbol is represented by a beetle that triggers the free spins game if three Scatters appear on the reels. \n\nThe paytable can be found in the menu of Beetle Mania Deluxe, highlighting the value of each symbol and the various payouts depending on the number of times it appears on the reels. During free spins, another symbol, the ladybug, doubles the winnings and brings good luck. As with Novomatic's tradition, players can also opt to play the Gamble feature after any win, which involves guessing the color of a face-down card for either a double or nothing payout.",

Developed by the gaming giant Novomatic, the game takes you on a journey through a musical garden filled with bugs who want to rock and roll all night long. </p><p>The game boasts 5 reels and 10 paylines, with a betting range of €0.02 to €50. That means everyone from penny pinchers to high rollers can get in on the action. The RTP is on the slightly lower side, at 94.19%, but the fun factor more than makes up for it.</p><p>Players can spin the reels to match various bugs playing instruments such as the snail on the saxophone, the ant on the drums, and the butterfly on the guitar. The queen bee is the highest paying symbol - get five of them in a row, and you’re in the money!</p><p>One thing we love about Beetle Mania Deluxe is the gamble feature. After scoring a win, players can choose to gamble their winnings to double or even quadruple them. We like living on the edge, so we always go for it - even if it's just for the thrill of the suspense! Unfortunately, the game doesn't have any bonus features, which could be a downside for some players.</p><p>In conclusion, Beetle Mania Deluxe is a fun and upbeat game that's perfect for those who enjoy humorous slots games. With its catchy tunes, quirky graphics, and chances to win big, it's no wonder this game has a dedicated fan base. Give it a spin and see if you can catch the beetle bug!</p>\"\n}"

The game offers a betting range of € 0.02 to € 50 with an RTP of 94.19%.\n\nGameplay Features\n\nBeetle Mania Deluxe offers an Autoplay button for automatic spins and a betting range between € 0.02 and € 50. The game's RTP is 94.19%, which could dissuade some players.\n\nSymbols and Their Values\n\nSymbols on the reels include card symbols from 10 to Ace along with cartoon insects like a cheerful snail, a grumpy caterpillar, and a yellow butterfly. The payment table in the game's menu indicates the value of each symbol and the various payouts for the number of times it appears on the reels.\n\nSpecial Symbols\n\nThere are three special symbols in Beetle Mania Deluxe. The bee is the game's Wild and can replace all other symbols except the Scatter and Bonus to complete a winning combination. The Scatter, depicted by a musical note, offers a variable number of free spins and awards a multiplier of up to x50. The Bonus symbol does not appear on the reels but is earned during the free spins feature.\n\nGamble Feature\n\nAfter any win, players have the option to play the Gamble feature, an extra game that offers leave or double mode. Players must guess whether a card is red or black. Correct guesses double winnings, while incorrect guesses result in losing the entire amount.\n\n        \n            ",

The game has a musical stage background across the playing grid with musical instruments and symbols of various paylines on the sides and the buttons to set the game at the bottom.\n\nThe Autoplay button allows for automatic spinning of the reels with a preset number of spins up to 1000 spins or until the stop button is clicked.\n\nThe betting range for this game is between € 0.02 and € 50, which is good, but the return to the player (RTP) is a measly 94.19%, which could dissuade some players.\n\nRegular and Special Symbols of Beetle Mania Deluxe\n\nSymbols on the reels include card symbols from 10 to Ace along with cute cartoon insects, such as a cheerful snail, a grumpy caterpillar, and a yellow butterfly. There are three special symbols in this game: the bee, which is the Wild and can replace all the other symbols except the Scatter and Bonus to complete a winning combination. The Scatter symbol, depicted by a musical note, does not only offer a variable number of free spins but also awards a multiplier of up to x50.\n\nThe payment table can be found in the Beetle Mania Deluxe menu, which indicates the value of each symbol and the various payouts for the number of times it appears on the reels.\n\nSpecial Features and Bonus Game of Beetle Mania Deluxe\n\nWhen three Scatter symbols (the music note) appear on the reels, players automatically gain access to the free spins bonus game, which offers 10 free spins. During free spins, another symbol, the ladybug, doubles the winnings while acting as a lucky charm.\n\nAs Novomatic has a tradition after any win, players have the option to play the Gamble feature, an extra game with leave or double mode. A card will appear on the screen, and players have to guess whether it is red or black. If the guess is correct, the winnings will be doubled, while an incorrect guess will result in losing the entire amount.\n        ",
