You must ensure that all winning percentages are high so you have the chance to earn during your plays.\n\nBut that's not all. The chosen slot machine must also be in line with your tastes. Otherwise, there would be no pleasure in playing and you would soon become bored.\n\nIf you love retro slots, like those played a few years ago in physical casinos, and want to enjoy a new gaming experience that combines entertainment and 3D, perhaps we have the slot machine for you.\n\nContinue reading to discover everything about Knight's Keep.\n\nRetro but 3D graphics\n\nKnight's Keep, the slot machine produced by WMS (Williams Interactive), is nothing more than the online experience of the famous physical slot that until a few years ago populated all casinos.\n\nYou will deal with kings, queens, knights, and castles. Among the symbols there are also swords and diamonds, to give a sort of retro air to the game.\n\nThanks to the incredible 3D graphics, you will really feel like you are inside the casino but at the same time immersed in a medieval world, dark but at the same time electrifying.\n\nIf the animations of this game are so interesting, it is mainly thanks to the Real Boost game engine, which is now used for the best slot machines on the market.\n\nIf your passion is the Middle Ages, with knights and queens to save, then you just have to try Knight's Keep. But first, you need to know all the functions and bonuses you can get!\n\nFunctions and bonuses\n\nIf the graphics can be somewhat retro, the bonuses and functions are decidedly more modern.\n\nThe configuration is typical of WMS, with 192 paylines, significantly higher than the average. Of course, more paylines mean a higher chance of making a lot of money.\n\nThe symbols you can find, of course, are related to the medieval world. The black knight represents a 10x multiplier, the king multiplies the stake by 300, while the queen multiplies it by 250. The crown multiplies the amount bet by 150 while the scepter by 100. These are truly important bonuses that allow you to get a lot of money.\n\nThe black knight, in addition to being a multiplier, is also the Wild symbol. It can be substituted within the payline representing any figure, in order to obtain a winning combination.\n\nThe free spins bonus, on the other hand, depending on how many times it appears between reels 3 and 6, will lead to a quantity of free spins from 5 to 25.\n\nOther slot machines similar to this\n\nIf you liked the medieval context, you should know that WMS has produced two other very interesting slot machines with knights and castles. The first is Black Knight, with 5 reels for a total of 30 paylines. It has a 3D graphics, so it can be ideal for those looking for beautiful images, but not the 3D experience.\n\nThen there is Black Knight 2, the sequel to the previous slot machine. There has not been a great evolution, but WMS has increased the probability of getting symbols in paylines.\n        ",
