Obviously, bees. And it's from this theme that the slot Beellionaires Dream Drop originates with a title that's a cute play on words. It was created by a renowned game provider who's always presenting new titles with enjoyable themes and features: Relax Gaming.\n\nIn this case, we have a hive structure of 5x4, potential winnings of up to 10,000 times the bet, progressive jackpots, RTP of 94%, and up to 1,024 paylines.\n\nSlot Graphics\n\nThe graphics are one of the true gems of Beellionaires Dream Drop: it has magnificent reels finished in wood, and in the background, we can admire a magnificent beehive palace worthy of a real beehive. To enhance its beauty on a stylistic level, there are symbols: the tankards, scrolls, trumpets, and jars of honey, which can pay up to 25 times the bet. There are also Jokers, Scatters, and a series of features that we can't wait to mention: get ready to discover the Royal Respins function in particular!\n\nGame Features and Functions\n\nWe'll start with the collection of coins that have random multipliers and can only be collected if a collection symbol is positioned in the spin. Then we'll move on to the Royal Respin function, which is activated only with 3 collector symbols. At that point, the player receives 3 respins, and the collector symbols themselves fixate on the positions where they stop. At that point, a rain of coins starts, which will thus enhance the multiplier of winnings.\n\nFinally, with the Bonus Game function, which is activated with Crown scatters, the player obtains 10, 15, or 20 spins respectively with 3 symbols, 4, or 5.\n\nFinal Considerations\n\nIf the design is, as we said, the real strength of Beellionaires Dream Drop, its numerous features are no less remarkable, well-developed in every respect. However, we do have to reveal the thing that surprised us most negatively: the RTP of the game is, or could be considered, a negative point in the eyes of the players. But it must be said that that 94% can be forgotten thanks to the presence of progressive jackpots and features that bring potential winnings up to 10,000 times the bet.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs the RTP of Beellionaires Dream Drop slot low?\n\nUnfortunately, yes, we have to say with extreme honesty that it's below average, and that factor surprised us a bit.
