    "original_text": "\nFort of Fortune\nIl Medioevo è di certo una delle epoche storiche più affascinanti, ricco di spunti interessanti per storie e leggende tramandate sino ai giorni nostri. La vita di corte, le battaglie sanguinarie, i duelli tra cavalieri, i giullari, sono gli elementi che hanno reso unico questo periodo storico. Non per nulla molte software house l’hanno adottato come tema portante dei loro prodotti, che poi è quello che ha scelto di fare anche la High 5 Games con Fort of Fortune. Uno degli aspetti di maggior impatto di questa slot è senz’altro la grafica curata nei minimi dettagli. La griglia corrisponde alla facciata del castello, con le torri al posto dei rulli durante una bella giornata di sole. Nella parte bassa troviamo le impostazioni per la puntata, il tasto Start e quello per l’Autoplay. La musica che accompagna il gioco ha toni epici ma senza risultare invadente, e comunque può essere disattivata in qualsiasi momento accedendo al menù.\nCaratteristiche della slot\nIn Fort of Fortune la griglia ha 5 rulli e 3 linee, con 20 linee di pagamento fisse. La puntata totale va da un minimo di 0,20 € a un massimo di 200 €. Durante i giri gratuiti, le vincite vengono calcolate sulla puntata del gioco regolare. Uno dei punti di forza di questa slot è senza dubbio il valore RTP molto alto, pari al 97%. Anche la volatilità è alta, così da avere vincite meno frequenti ma comunque importanti. È possibile impostare da 10 a 100 giri automatici con alcuni limiti di perdita. Dalla stessa schermata è possibile anche selezionare la modalità turbo per accelerare la rotazione dei rulli.\nSimboli e funzionalità\nCominciamo l’argomento introducendo la funzione Tumbling Reels, che comporta l’esplosione dei simboli vincenti che verranno rimpiazzati da nuovi simboli. Nel caso anch’essi concorrano a formare nuove combinazioni paganti, la funzione andrà avanti.\nIn Fort of Fortune abbiamo simboli di basso valore, di alto valore e di altissimo valore. I primi come di consueto sono rappresentati dalle carte da gioco: oltre alle figure e all’asso c’è anche il numero 5.\nI simboli di alto valore sono invece le figure del principe, della principessa e del re. Quelli di altissimo valore sono invece gli stessi regnanti ma replicati per 2, 3 o 4 vote nello stesso simbolo. Per sbloccarli è necessario che sia attiva la funzione Spin-Crease, legata al numero di giri effettuati e al valore della scommessa. In pratica se puntiamo avremo questi simboli speciali dall’altissimo valore.\nLa statua del demone è il nostro simbolo Wild, può apparire solo sui rulli 2, 3 e 4 e va a sostituire tutti i simboli eccetto lo Scatter, che è rappresentato dal drago. Se quest’ultimo appare per almeno 3 volte, ci verranno assegnati 11 o 12 giri gratuiti.\n",

Court life, bloody battles, knight duels, and jesters are the elements that have made this period unique. That's why many software houses have adopted it as the main theme of their products, and this is also what High 5 Games has chosen to do with Fort of Fortune. One of the most impactful aspects of this slot is undoubtedly the graphics, which are carefully detailed. The grid corresponds to the facade of the castle, with the towers in place of the reels on a beautiful sunny day. At the bottom, we find the settings for the bet, the Start button, and the Autoplay button. The game's accompanying music has epic tones but is not intrusive and can be turned off at any time by accessing the menu.\n\nSlot Features\n\nIn Fort of Fortune, the grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 20 fixed paylines. The total bet ranges from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €200. During free spins, winnings are calculated based on the regular game bet. One of the strengths of this slot is undoubtedly the very high RTP value, at 97%. The volatility is also high, so there are less frequent but still significant winnings. You can set up from 10 to 100 automatic spins with some loss limits. From the same screen, you can also select the turbo mode to speed up the rotation of the reels.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nLet's start by introducing the Tumbling Reels function, which causes the explosion of winning symbols that will be replaced by new symbols. If they also contribute to form new paying combinations, the function will continue. In Fort of Fortune, we have low-, high- and very high-value symbols. The first ones, as usual, are represented by playing cards: in addition to the figures and the ace, there is also the number 5. The high-value symbols are instead the figures of the prince, the princess, and the king. The very high-value symbols are instead the same rulers but replicated 2, 3, or 4 times in the same symbol. To unlock them, the Spin-Crease function must be active, linked to the number of spins and the value of the bet. In practice, if we bet, we will have these special symbols with very high value. The demon statue is our Wild symbol, it can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, which is represented by the dragon. If the latter appears at least 3 times, we will be awarded 11 or 12 free spins.\n\nExpert Gambler Review:\n\nFort of Fortune is a beautifully crafted slot game that transports you to the medieval ages. Featuring rich graphics and an epic soundtrack, this high volatility slot game offers the chance to win big with its very high RTP value. The Tumbling Reels function keeps the excitement high, and the Spin-Crease function unlocks very high-value symbols for those willing to bet bigger.

Court life, bloody battles, knight duels, and jesters are the elements that have made this period unique. That's why many software houses have adopted it as the main theme of their products, and this is also what High 5 Games has chosen to do with Fort of Fortune. One of the most impactful aspects of this slot is undoubtedly the graphics, which are carefully detailed. The grid corresponds to the facade of the castle, with the towers in place of the reels on a beautiful sunny day. At the bottom, we find the settings for the bet, the Start button, and the Autoplay button. The game's accompanying music has epic tones but is not intrusive and can be turned off at any time by accessing the menu.\n\nSlot Features\n\nIn Fort of Fortune, the grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 20 fixed paylines. The total bet ranges from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €200. During free spins, winnings are calculated based on the regular game bet. One of the strengths of this slot is undoubtedly the very high RTP value, at 97%. The volatility is also high, so there are less frequent but still significant winnings. You can set up from 10 to 100 automatic spins with some loss limits. From the same screen, you can also select the turbo mode to speed up the rotation of the reels.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nLet's start by introducing the Tumbling Reels function, which causes the explosion of winning symbols that will be replaced by new symbols. If they also contribute to form new paying combinations, the function will continue. In Fort of Fortune, we have low-, high- and very high-value symbols. The first ones, as usual, are represented by playing cards: in addition to the figures and the ace, there is also the number 5. The high-value symbols are instead the figures of the prince, the princess, and the king. The very high-value symbols are instead the same rulers but replicated 2, 3, or 4 times in the same symbol. To unlock them, the Spin-Crease function must be active, linked to the number of spins and the value of the bet. In practice, if we bet, we will have these special symbols with very high value. The demon statue is our Wild symbol, it can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, which is represented by the dragon. If the latter appears at least 3 times, we will be awarded 11 or 12 free spins.\n\nExpert Gambler Review:\n\nFort of Fortune is a beautifully crafted slot game that transports you to the medieval ages. Featuring rich graphics and an epic soundtrack, this high volatility slot game offers the chance to win big with its very high RTP value. The Tumbling Reels function keeps the excitement high, and the Spin-Crease function unlocks very high-value symbols for those willing to bet bigger. This game is perfect for experienced gamblers looking for a thrilling and rewarding experience.\n            ",

Include the words \"play\" and \"free\".\n\nRespond with a JSON using the keys \"pros\" (simple array), \"cons\" (simple array), \"meta_title\" and \"meta_description\". \n\nReview:\n \nGameplay\n\nFort of Fortune has a grid of 5 reels and 3 rows with 20 fixed paylines. The total bet ranges from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €200. It has a very high RTP value of 97% and high volatility, offering less frequent but significant winnings. It also has the Tumbling Reels function, where winning symbols explode and are replaced by new ones. The Spin-Crease function unlocks special symbols with very high value for bigger bets. Additionally, there is an Autoplay button with loss limits and turbo mode.\n\nGraphics and Design\n\nThe graphics of Fort of Fortune are visually attractive and detailed. The grid corresponds to the castle facade, with the towers in the place of the reels. The game has an epic soundtrack that matches the medieval theme, and it is not intrusive nor excessively loud. The Start and Autoplay buttons and the settings for the bet are located at the bottom of the screen.\n\nBonuses and Special Features\n\nIn addition to the Tumbling Reels and Spin-Crease functions, Fort of Fortune also has very high-value symbols that can be unlocked. Demon statue acts as the Wild symbol, appearing on reels 2, 3, and 4, and replaces all symbols except the Scatter. The Scatter is represented by the dragon, and if it appears at least 3 times, it will award either 11 or 12 free spins.\n\nPayouts\n\nFort of Fortune offers high payouts due to its very high RTP value of 97%. The volatility is high, and wins may be less frequent but still significant. When unlocking the Spin-Crease function, special symbols with very high value can be won, making the potential payouts higher.\n\nOverall Experience\n\nFort of Fortune is a beautifully crafted slot game that fans of the middle ages will enjoy. It boasts a high RTP value and high volatility, making it perfect for experienced gamblers looking for a thrilling and rewarding experience. The Tumbling Reels and Spin-Crease functions keep the gameplay exciting, and the graphics and soundtrack add to the medieval atmosphere.\n\n        \n            ",

Court life, bloody battles, knight duels, and jesters are the elements that have made this period unique. That's why many software houses have adopted it as the main theme of their products, and this is also what High 5 Games has chosen to do with Fort of Fortune. One of the most impactful aspects of this slot is undoubtedly the graphics, which are carefully detailed. The grid corresponds to the facade of the castle, with the towers in place of the reels on a beautiful sunny day. At the bottom, we find the settings for the bet, the Start button, and the Autoplay button. The game's accompanying music has epic tones but is not intrusive and can be turned off at any time by accessing the menu.\n\nSlot Features\n\nIn Fort of Fortune, the grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 20 fixed paylines. The total bet ranges from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €200. During free spins, winnings are calculated based on the regular game bet. One of the strengths of this slot is undoubtedly the very high RTP value, at 97%. The volatility is also high, so there are less frequent but still significant winnings. You can set up from 10 to 100 automatic spins with some loss limits. From the same screen, you can also select the turbo mode to speed up the rotation of the reels.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nLet's start by introducing the Tumbling Reels function, which causes the explosion of winning symbols that will be replaced by new symbols. If they also contribute to form new paying combinations, the function will continue. In Fort of Fortune, we have low-, high- and very high-value symbols. The first ones, as usual, are represented by playing cards: in addition to the figures and the ace, there is also the number 5. The high-value symbols are instead the figures of the prince, the princess, and the king. The very high-value symbols are instead the same rulers but replicated 2, 3, or 4 times in the same symbol. To unlock them, the Spin-Crease function must be active, linked to the number of spins and the value of the bet. In practice, if we bet, we will have these special symbols with very high value. The demon statue is our Wild symbol, it can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, which is represented by the dragon. If the latter appears at least 3 times, we will be awarded 11 or 12 free spins.\n\nExpert Gambler Review:\n\nFort of Fortune is a beautifully crafted slot game that transports you to the medieval ages. Featuring rich graphics and an epic soundtrack, this high volatility slot game offers the chance to win big with its very high RTP value. The Tumbling Reels function keeps the excitement high, and the Spin-Crease function unlocks very high-value symbols for those willing to bet bigger. This game is perfect for experienced gamblers looking for a thrilling and rewarding experience.\n            ",

Court life, bloody battles, knight duels, and jesters are the elements that have made this period unique. That's why many software houses have adopted it as the main theme of their products, and this is also what High 5 Games has chosen to do with Fort of Fortune. One of the most impactful aspects of this slot is undoubtedly the graphics, which are carefully detailed. The grid corresponds to the facade of the castle, with the towers in place of the reels on a beautiful sunny day. At the bottom, we find the settings for the bet, the Start button, and the Autoplay button. The game's accompanying music has epic tones but is not intrusive and can be turned off at any time by accessing the menu.\n\nSlot Features\n\nIn Fort of Fortune, the grid has 5 reels and 3 rows, with 20 fixed paylines. The total bet ranges from a minimum of €0.20 to a maximum of €200. During free spins, winnings are calculated based on the regular game bet. One of the strengths of this slot is undoubtedly the very high RTP value, at 97%. The volatility is also high, so there are less frequent but still significant winnings. You can set up from 10 to 100 automatic spins with some loss limits. From the same screen, you can also select the turbo mode to speed up the rotation of the reels.\n\nSymbols and Features\n\nLet's start by introducing the Tumbling Reels function, which causes the explosion of winning symbols that will be replaced by new symbols. If they also contribute to form new paying combinations, the function will continue. In Fort of Fortune, we have low-, high- and very high-value symbols. The first ones, as usual, are represented by playing cards: in addition to the figures and the ace, there is also the number 5. The high-value symbols are instead the figures of the prince, the princess, and the king. The very high-value symbols are instead the same rulers but replicated 2, 3, or 4 times in the same symbol. To unlock them, the Spin-Crease function must be active, linked to the number of spins and the value of the bet. In practice, if we bet, we will have these special symbols with very high value. The demon statue is our Wild symbol, it can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 and replaces all symbols except the Scatter, which is represented by the dragon. If the latter appears at least 3 times, we will be awarded 11 or 12 free spins.\n\nExpert Gambler Review:\n\nFort of Fortune is a beautifully crafted slot game that transports you to the medieval ages. Featuring rich graphics and an epic soundtrack, this high volatility slot game offers the chance to win big with its very high RTP value. The Tumbling Reels function keeps the excitement high, and the Spin-Crease function unlocks very high-value symbols for those willing to bet bigger. This game is perfect for experienced gamblers looking for a thrilling and rewarding experience.\n        ",
