            "response": "Dragons Temple \nStraight from the gaming minds at Spielo, Dragons Temple is a 50 payline slot with a distinct Chinese theme. As the title suggests, players can expect to see Chinese symbols like dragons, koi carp and the yin and yang circle, all adding to the slot's fun features. You'll have the chance to land a full-expanding reel or a scatter that triggers up to three free spin options. Players will appreciate the uncomplicated setup, but still enjoy the excellent graphics and great features on offer. \n\nOriental Graphics \nThe slot has a decidedly Chinese look, with various details paying tribute to the country. All the text, from the slot title to the playing card symbols, have been reinterpreted in Chinese, presented in a font that's very similar to the hanzi Chinese characters in writing. The symbols are also common elements associated with China, such as koi carp and lanterns. \n\nAs the reels spin, you can hear the sounds of traditional Chinese music, including stringed instruments, flutes, and drums. It helps to make the slot more authentic, with the sounds that increase in intensity only when a win or feature is activated.\n\nSlot Machine Functions and Symbols \nAt the bottom of the page, you'll see the colourful playing card symbols which act as the lower paying symbols on the reels. Each pays a different amount, with 10 being the lowest paying, giving 15,000 for x3, 30,000 for x4 and 90,000 for x5. The highest paying, the A, pays 30,000, 75,000 and 600,0000 for three, four, and five. \n\nThe blue leafy vase is the first of the more significant paying symbols you will come across. These also pay when you land only two on the reels instead of three, four, and five. The vase pays up to a maximum of 750,000, while the koi carp will increase your balance by 900,000 when you land five on the reels. The lanterns are next on the payment scale, with a maximum payout of 1,200,000, while the temple will give you 1,500,000. \n\nEven the many colourful dragons pay well, as does the Dragon's Temple logo, with both symbols giving 15,000 for x2, 150,000 for x3, 600,000 for x4, and a whopping 3,000,000. This is an incredible amount of money, making this slot the perfect option for high rollers. \n\nThere are two main features when playing Dragons Temple. The first concerns the dragon symbols. These five dragons, each with their own reel, are Wild symbols, meaning they can replace all other symbols on the reels except for the Scatter. The Wild dragons are also much more than what you see at first. When a dragon is part of a winning combination, it will expand to cover the entire reel, potentially triggering a huge payout. \n\nThe second feature concerns the Yin Yang symbol, which is also the Scatter. In addition to a tasty payout for two and three matching symbols, landing three is also the key to the free spins bonus. Once the free spins selection has been activated, players will need to choose one of three options. \n\nSimilar Slot Machines \nIf you enjoyed the theme of this Spielo Slot Machine, we can suggest betting your money on Triple Dragons, the Slot Machine produced by Pragmatic Play.

            "prompt": "\nBelow is a text about the slot game \"Dragons Temple\".\nPlease remove any part of the text that is like an FAQ.\n\nDragon's Temple \nFrom the game creators Spielo, Dragon's Temple is a 50 payline slot with a distinct Chinese theme. As the title of the slot suggests, you can expect to see Chinese symbols such as dragons, koi carp, and the yin and yang symbol, which are all part of the fun features of the slot. Spinning the reels gives you a chance to land a full and expanding reel or a scatter that triggers up to three free spin options. Players will appreciate the simple setup, but they can still enjoy the excellent graphics and great features it offers.\n\nOriental Graphics \nThe slot has a decidedly Chinese look, with several details that pay homage to the country. All the writings included on the reels, from the slot title to the playing card symbols, have been reinterpreted in Chinese, as they are presented with a character very similar to the Chinese hanzi characters found in writing. The symbols are also common elements associated with China, including koi carp and lanterns.\n\nAs the reels spin, you can hear the sounds associated with traditional Chinese music, which includes stringed instruments, flutes, and drums. This helps make the slot more authentic, with the sounds intensifying only when you activate a win or a feature.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine \nAt the bottom of the page, you will see the colorful playing card symbols, which serve as the lower-paying symbols on the reels. Each pays a different amount, with 10, the lowest-paying symbol, giving 15,000 for x3, 30,000 for x4, and 90,000 for x5. The highest-paying symbol, the A, pays 30,000, 75,000, and 600,000 for three, four, and five.\n\nThe blue ornamental vase is the first of the more significant paying symbols you will find. These also pay when you land only two on the reels, instead of three, four, and five. The vase pays a maximum amount of 750,000, while the carp will increase your balance by 900,000 when you find five on the reels. Lanterns are next on the payout scale, with a maximum payout of 1,200,000, while the temple will give you 1,500,000.\n\nEven the many colorful dragons pay well, as does the Dragon's Temple logo, with both symbols giving 15,000 for x2, 150,000 for x3, 600,000 for x4, and 3,000,000,000 for x5 of the same. This is an incredible amount of money, making this slot the perfect choice for high rollers.\n\nThere are two main features when playing Dragon's Temple. The first concerns the dragon symbols. These five dragons, each with its reel, are Wild symbols, meaning they can replace all other symbols on the reels except the Scatter. The Wild dragons are also much more than what meets the eye at first glance. When a dragon is part of a winning combination, it will expand to cover the entire reel, potentially triggering a huge payout.\n\nThe second feature concerns the Yin Yang symbol, which is also the Scatter. In addition to a tasty payout for two and three matching symbols, finding three is also the key to the free spin bonus. Once the free spin selection has been activated, players will need to choose one of the three options.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines \nIf you enjoyed the theme of this Spielo slot machine, we can suggest betting your money on Triple Dragons, the slot machine produced by Pragmatic Play. In addition to its very interesting graphics, you can enjoy the incredible RTP of 96.51%!\n        ",

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nDragon's Temple gameplay features\nChinese theme and symbols\nSlot game graphics and music\nGame symbols and paylines\nComparison to similar slot games\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Dragon's Temple \nFrom the game creators Spielo, Dragon's Temple is a 50 payline slot with a distinct Chinese theme. As the title of the slot suggests, you can expect to see Chinese symbols such as dragons, koi carp, and the yin and yang symbol, which are all part of the fun features of the slot. Spinning the reels gives you a chance to land a full and expanding reel or a scatter that triggers up to three free spin options. Players will appreciate the simple setup, but they can still enjoy the excellent graphics and great features it offers.\n\nOriental Graphics \nThe slot has a decidedly Chinese look, with several details that pay homage to the country. All the writings included on the reels, from the slot title to the playing card symbols, have been reinterpreted in Chinese, as they are presented with a character very similar to the Chinese hanzi characters found in writing. The symbols are also common elements associated with China, including koi carp and lanterns.\n\nAs the reels spin, you can hear the sounds associated with traditional Chinese music, which includes stringed instruments, flutes, and drums. This helps make the slot more authentic, with the sounds intensifying only when you activate a win or a feature.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine \nAt the bottom of the page, you will see the colorful playing card symbols, which serve as the lower-paying symbols on the reels. Each pays a different amount, with 10, the lowest-paying symbol, giving 15,000 for x3, 30,000 for x4, and 90,000 for x5. The highest-paying symbol, the A, pays 30,000, 75,000, and 600,000 for three, four, and five.\n\nThe blue ornamental vase is the first of the more significant paying symbols you will find. These also pay when you land only two on the reels, instead of three, four, and five. The vase pays a maximum amount of 750,000, while the carp will increase your balance by 900,000 when you find five on the reels. Lanterns are next on the payout scale, with a maximum payout of 1,200,000, while the temple will give you 1,500,000.\n\nEven the many colorful dragons pay well, as does the Dragon's Temple logo, with both symbols giving 15,000 for x2, 150,000 for x3, 600,000 for x4, and 3,000,000,000 for x5 of the same. This is an incredible amount of money, making this slot the perfect choice for high rollers.\n\nThere are two main features when playing Dragon's Temple. The first concerns the dragon symbols. These five dragons, each with its reel, are Wild symbols, meaning they can replace all other symbols on the reels except the Scatter. The Wild dragons are also much more than what meets the eye at first glance. When a dragon is part of a winning combination, it will expand to cover the entire reel, potentially triggering a huge payout.\n\nThe second feature concerns the Yin Yang symbol, which is also the Scatter. In addition to a tasty payout for two and three matching symbols, finding three is also the key to the free spin bonus. Once the free spin selection has been activated, players will need to choose one of the three options.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines \nIf you enjoyed the theme of this Spielo slot machine, we can suggest betting your money on Triple Dragons, the slot machine produced by Pragmatic Play. In addition to its very interesting graphics, you can enjoy the incredible RTP of 96.51%!\n            ",

As the title of the slot suggests, you can expect to see Chinese symbols such as dragons, koi carp, and the yin and yang symbol, which are all part of the fun features of the slot. Spinning the reels gives you a chance to land a full and expanding reel or a scatter that triggers up to three free spin options. Players will appreciate the simple setup, but they can still enjoy the excellent graphics and great features it offers.\n\nOriental Graphics \nThe slot has a decidedly Chinese look, with several details that pay homage to the country. All the writings included on the reels, from the slot title to the playing card symbols, have been reinterpreted in Chinese, as they are presented with a character very similar to the Chinese hanzi characters found in writing. The symbols are also common elements associated with China, including koi carp and lanterns.\n\nAs the reels spin, you can hear the sounds associated with traditional Chinese music, which includes stringed instruments, flutes, and drums. This helps make the slot more authentic, with the sounds intensifying only when you activate a win or a feature.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine \nAt the bottom of the page, you will see the colorful playing card symbols, which serve as the lower-paying symbols on the reels. Each pays a different amount, with 10, the lowest-paying symbol, giving 15,000 for x3, 30,000 for x4, and 90,000 for x5. The highest-paying symbol, the A, pays 30,000, 75,000, and 600,000 for three, four, and five.\n\nThe blue ornamental vase is the first of the more significant paying symbols you will find. These also pay when you land only two on the reels, instead of three, four, and five. The vase pays a maximum amount of 750,000, while the carp will increase your balance by 900,000 when you find five on the reels. Lanterns are next on the payout scale, with a maximum payout of 1,200,000, while the temple will give you 1,500,000.\n\nEven the many colorful dragons pay well, as does the Dragon's Temple logo, with both symbols giving 15,000 for x2, 150,000 for x3, 600,000 for x4, and 3,000,000,000 for x5 of the same. This is an incredible amount of money, making this slot the perfect choice for high rollers.\n\nThere are two main features when playing Dragon's Temple. The first concerns the dragon symbols. These five dragons, each with its reel, are Wild symbols, meaning they can replace all other symbols on the reels except the Scatter. The Wild dragons are also much more than what meets the eye at first glance. When a dragon is part of a winning combination, it will expand to cover the entire reel, potentially triggering a huge payout.\n\nThe second feature concerns the Yin Yang symbol, which is also the Scatter. In addition to a tasty payout for two and three matching symbols, finding three is also the key to the free spin bonus. Once the free spin selection has been activated, players will need to choose one of the three options.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines \nIf you enjoyed the theme of this Spielo slot machine, we can suggest betting your money on Triple Dragons, the slot machine produced by Pragmatic Play. In addition to its very interesting graphics, you can enjoy the incredible RTP of 96.51%!\n            ",

As the title of the slot suggests, you can expect to see Chinese symbols such as dragons, koi carp, and the yin and yang symbol, which are all part of the fun features of the slot. Spinning the reels gives you a chance to land a full and expanding reel or a scatter that triggers up to three free spin options. Players will appreciate the simple setup, but they can still enjoy the excellent graphics and great features it offers.\n\nOriental Graphics \nThe slot has a decidedly Chinese look, with several details that pay homage to the country. All the writings included on the reels, from the slot title to the playing card symbols, have been reinterpreted in Chinese, as they are presented with a character very similar to the Chinese hanzi characters found in writing. The symbols are also common elements associated with China, including koi carp and lanterns.\n\nAs the reels spin, you can hear the sounds associated with traditional Chinese music, which includes stringed instruments, flutes, and drums. This helps make the slot more authentic, with the sounds intensifying only when you activate a win or a feature.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine \nAt the bottom of the page, you will see the colorful playing card symbols, which serve as the lower-paying symbols on the reels. Each pays a different amount, with 10, the lowest-paying symbol, giving 15,000 for x3, 30,000 for x4, and 90,000 for x5. The highest-paying symbol, the A, pays 30,000, 75,000, and 600,000 for three, four, and five.\n\nThe blue ornamental vase is the first of the more significant paying symbols you will find. These also pay when you land only two on the reels, instead of three, four, and five. The vase pays a maximum amount of 750,000, while the carp will increase your balance by 900,000 when you find five on the reels. Lanterns are next on the payout scale, with a maximum payout of 1,200,000, while the temple will give you 1,500,000.\n\nEven the many colorful dragons pay well, as does the Dragon's Temple logo, with both symbols giving 15,000 for x2, 150,000 for x3, 600,000 for x4, and 3,000,000,000 for x5 of the same. This is an incredible amount of money, making this slot the perfect choice for high rollers.\n\nThere are two main features when playing Dragon's Temple. The first concerns the dragon symbols. These five dragons, each with its reel, are Wild symbols, meaning they can replace all other symbols on the reels except the Scatter. The Wild dragons are also much more than what meets the eye at first glance. When a dragon is part of a winning combination, it will expand to cover the entire reel, potentially triggering a huge payout.\n\nThe second feature concerns the Yin Yang symbol, which is also the Scatter. In addition to a tasty payout for two and three matching symbols, finding three is also the key to the free spin bonus.
