Atterra cinque dei simboli a pagamento più alti durante il gioco regolare per vincere 900x monete. Questo gioco a cinque rulli e dieci linee a pagamento ha la capacità di corteggiare anche i giocatori di slot più esigenti.\nFairy Queen è un fantastico gioco tranquillo che è sicuramente qui per riempire le vostre tasche di denaro!\n\nUna grafica fantasy\nLa slot online Fairy Queen apparirà in qualche modo familiare a coloro che hanno giocato ad alcuni dei giochi di carte da gioco che coinvolgono creature magiche e strane. Ma non lasciate che questo vi dissuada. Quello che abbiamo qui è una slot online a tutto tondo che sembra proprio carina, ma che offre il bagliore di una vera macchina da gioco d’azzardo. I simboli del gioco sono stati tutti disegnati con colori brillanti che giocano bene sullo sfondo onirico e misterioso.\nIl simbolo più pagante è il Selvaggio, che è la Regina delle Fate in persona, che è una bellezza coronata che sembra essere prolifica nella magia. Non c’è da stupirsi che ci siano Free Spins che vengono con l’atterraggio di tre simboli Scatter in qualsiasi punto del set di bobine. Gli altri simboli del gioco sono le lettere e i numeri delle carte nove, dieci, fante, regina, re e asso.\nQuesti sono i simboli di basso valore, mentre quelli di alto valore sono il fungo viola e il fiore bizzarro, il drago fata rosa, l’elfo con il grazioso cappello e l’albero che ha un volto umano e sembra essere una delle persone più gentili del mondo. Il simbolo dello Spargimento porta la caratteristica delle rotazioni gratuite della slot Fairy Queen.\nIl resto delle caratteristiche di design del gioco sono altrettanto spettacolari. Il gioco offre una grande azione di bobina su un Return to Player del 95,09% che è abbastanza solida. Poi il punteggio della musica è abbastanza piacevole e le impostazioni sono facili da configurare.\n\nFunzioni e simboli della Slot Machine\nIl simbolo di pagamento più alto è il simbolo wild della Regina delle fate che porta 900x monete quando si atterra cinque. Il punteggio di questa combinazione con la possibilità di un simbolo Wild può essere un po’ difficile, ma questo è il motivo per cui atterrare tre dei simboli del Portale delle Luci Scatter non lo è. Questa combinazione porta la caratteristica di dieci giri gratis bonus. Durante questa funzione, un simbolo speciale è alloggiato nella prima e talvolta nella seconda bobina. Questo simbolo ha la possibilità di espandersi in modo casuale sulle bobine da uno a tre. In ogni caso, i giri gratis portano combinazioni vincenti garantite e crediamo che questa sia l’esperienza di tutti i giocatori che sono rimasti con questo gioco abbastanza a lungo da attivare la caratteristica di gioco. Inoltre, i giri gratis possono essere recuperati durante la funzione atterrando combinazioni aggiuntive di tre simboli del Portale delle Luci.\nQuesto gioco ha un risultato molto bello di Ritorno al giocatore. Considerando la caratteristica dei giri gratis riattivabili e il benevolo generatore di pagamenti casuali, l’RTP sembra goffamente alto in confronto ad altre slot online.\nMa non siamo qui semplicemente per stupirci. Giocare il gioco può portare a una divertente passeggiata attraverso la foresta delle slot Fairy Queen, in cui ci sono molti frutti a penzoloni, oltre ai due grandi premi in denaro che è molto possibile ottenere con un solo fortunato tentativo durante la funzione Free Spins.\nTrovate alcuni dei fiori rossi o dei funghi di bosco preferiti dalle fate e potreste vincere fino a 250.000 monete, mentre avvistare il volo ipnotico dei draghi farfalla può farvi vincere fino a 400.000 monete, e trovare gli uomini dell’albero o i Pixies è ancora più gratificante con premi fino a 750.000 monete. Tuttavia, anche questi tremendi premi non sono poi così magici: puoi vincere fino a 7.500.000 monete per trovare le Luci Magiche delle Fate e fino a 9.000.000 di monete per trovare la Regina.\nAlla Regina piace anche scatenarsi con i suoi bonus e adora incantare gli altri simboli in modo da poterli sostituire per contribuire a creare linee ancora più vincenti. Nel frattempo 3 o più Scattered Fairy Lights scatenerà 10 giochi gratuiti in cui ogni gioco è garantito per vincere un premio. Tutti questi premi, e qualsiasi altro premio, possono anche essere scommessi sulla funzione Turn-A-Card gamble Feature. Basta prevedere se la carta sarà rossa o nera per raddoppiare i vostri soldi.\n\nAltre Slot Machine simili\nGira per avere la possibilità di vincere su 10 o 20 linee di pagamento sulla slot Fire Queen di Amatic. Il gioco ha un layout 3×5 e un intervallo di credito tra 20 e 1000. Le vincite più alte sono fatte con il simbolo del castello che paga 1000x sulla scommessa payline per cinque.\n",

Land five of the highest paying symbols during regular game play for a chance to win 900x coins. This five-reel, ten-payline game has enough charm to captivate even the most discerning slot players.\nThe graphics of Fairy Queen are reminiscent of popular fantasy card games, but don't let that fool you. This online slot machine has all the glitz and glamour of a true gambling machine. The symbols are designed with bright colors that play well against the dreamy and mysterious background. \n\nThe highest paying symbol is the Wild, which is the Fairy Queen herself, a crowned beauty who seems to be prolific in magic. It's no wonder that Free Spins come with the landing of three Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. The other symbols in the game are the card letters and numbers nine, ten, jack, queen, king, and ace. These are the low-value symbols, while the high-value symbols are the purple mushroom and bizarre flower, the pink fairy dragon, the elf with the cute hat, and the tree with a human face, which seems to be one of the kindest people in the world. The Scatters symbol brings the feature of the free spins of the Fairy Queen slot.\nThe rest of the game's design features are equally spectacular. The game offers big reel action with a solid Return to Player of 95.09%. The music score is quite pleasant and the settings are easy to configure. \n\nThe highest paying symbol is the wild symbol of the Fairy Queen, which pays out 900x coins when you land five of them. This combination with the possibility of a Wild symbol can be a bit tricky, but that's why landing three of the Scatter Portals of Light symbols is not. This combination brings the feature of ten bonus free spins. During this feature, a special symbol is housed in the first and sometimes second reel. This symbol has the chance to randomly expand across reels one to three. In any case, free spins bring guaranteed winning combinations and we believe that this is the experience of all players who have stuck with this game long enough to activate the gameplay feature. Additionally, free spins can be retriggered during the feature by landing additional combinations of three Portal of Light symbols.\nThis game has a very nice Return to Player outcome. Considering the feature of retriggerable free spins and the benevolent random payout generator, the RTP seems clumsily high compared to other online slots.\nBut we're not here just to be amazed. Playing the game can lead to a fun walk through the Fairy Queen slot forest, where there are many fruits to dangle, in addition to the two big cash prizes that are very possible to get with just one lucky attempt during the Free Spins feature.\nFind some of the red flowers or the forest mushrooms favored by the fairies and you could win up to 250,000 coins, while sighting the hypnotic flight of the butterfly dragons can earn you up to 400,000 coins, and finding the tree men or Pixies is even more rewarding with prizes up to 750,000 coins. However, even these tremendous prizes are not that magical: you can win up to 7,500,000 coins for finding the Fairy Magic Lights and up to 9,000,000 coins for finding the Queen.\nThe Queen also likes to unleash her bonuses and loves to enchant other symbols so that she can replace them to help create even more winning lines. Meanwhile, three or more Scattered Fairy Lights will trigger 10 free games in which each game is guaranteed to win a prize. All of these prizes, and any other prize, can also be gambled on the Turn-A-Card gamble feature. Just predict whether the card will be red or black to double your money.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\nSpin to win on 10 or 20 pay lines on the Fire Queen slot by Amatic.

Then the music score is quite pleasant, and the settings are easy to configure.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe highest paying symbol is the wild symbol of the Fairy Queen, which carries 900x coins when you land five. The score of this combination with the possibility of a Wild symbol can be a bit difficult, but this is why landing three of the Scatter symbols of the Portal of Lights is not. This combination carries the feature of ten free bonus spins. During this feature, a special symbol is housed in the first and sometimes the second reel. This symbol has the chance to randomly expand on reels one to three. In any case, free spins bring guaranteed winning combinations, and we believe this is the experience of all players who have stayed with this game long enough to activate the game feature. Plus, free spins can be retrieved during the feature by landing additional combinations of three Portal of Lights symbols.\nThis game has a very nice Return to Player outcome. Given the feature of the reactivatable free spins and the benevolent random payout generator, the RTP seems awkwardly high compared to other online slots.\nBut we're not just here to marvel. Playing the game can lead to a fun walk through the Fairy Queen slot forest, where there are many fruits hanging and the two big cash prizes that are very possible to get on a lucky try during the Free Spins feature.\nFind some of the red flowers or forest mushrooms preferred by fairies and you could win up to 250,000 coins, while catching the hypnotic flight of butterfly dragons can win you up to 400,000 coins, and finding the tree men or Pixies is even more rewarding with prizes up to 750,000 coins. However, even these tremendous prizes are not that magical: you can win up to 7,500,000 coins to find the Magical Lights of the Fairies and up to 9,000,000 coins to find the Queen.\nThe Queen also likes to unleash her bonuses and loves to enchant other symbols so she can substitute them to contribute to even more winning lines. Meanwhile, 3 or more Scattered Fairy Lights will trigger 10 free games where every game is guaranteed to win a prize. All of these prizes, and any other prizes, can also be bet on the Turn-A-Card gamble Feature. Just predict whether the card will be red or black to double your money.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nSpin for the chance to win on 10 or 20 paylines on the Fire Queen slot by Amatic.

The game offers great reel action on a 95.09% Return to Player that is quite solid. Then the music score is quite pleasant, and the settings are easy to configure.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe highest paying symbol is the wild symbol of the Fairy Queen, which carries 900x coins when you land five. The score of this combination with the possibility of a Wild symbol can be a bit difficult, but this is why landing three of the Scatter symbols of the Portal of Lights is not. This combination carries the feature of ten free bonus spins. During this feature, a special symbol is housed in the first and sometimes the second reel. This symbol has the chance to randomly expand on reels one to three. In any case, free spins bring guaranteed winning combinations, and we believe this is the experience of all players who have stayed with this game long enough to activate the game feature. Plus, free spins can be retrieved during the feature by landing additional combinations of three Portal of Lights symbols.\nThis game has a very nice Return to Player outcome. Given the feature of the reactivatable free spins and the benevolent random payout generator, the RTP seems awkwardly high compared to other online slots.\nBut we're not just here to marvel. Playing the game can lead to a fun walk through the Fairy Queen slot forest, where there are many fruits hanging and the two big cash prizes that are very possible to get on a lucky try during the Free Spins feature.\nFind some of the red flowers or forest mushrooms preferred by fairies and you could win up to 250,000 coins, while catching the hypnotic flight of butterfly dragons can win you up to 400,000 coins, and finding the tree men or Pixies is even more rewarding with prizes up to 750,000 coins. However, even these tremendous prizes are not that magical: you can win up to 7,500,000 coins to find the Magical Lights of the Fairies and up to 9,000,000 coins to find the Queen.\nThe Queen also likes to unleash her bonuses and loves to enchant other symbols so she can substitute them to contribute to even more winning lines. Meanwhile, 3 or more Scattered Fairy Lights will trigger 10 free games where every game is guaranteed to win a prize. All of these prizes, and any other prizes, can also be bet on the Turn-A-Card gamble Feature. Just predict whether the card will be red or black to double your money.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nSpin for the chance to win on 10 or 20 paylines on the Fire Queen slot by Amatic.

Write subsections covering only the following topics:\n\nGameplay and Jackpot\nGraphics and Symbols\nWild and Scatter Symbols\nReturn to Player and Betting Features\nFree Spins and Bonus Spins\nComparison to Other Slot Games\n\n- The review must be very detailed\n- No FAQ\n- No Notes\n- Respond with a JSON array, one item per topic (use the keys \"headline\" and \"content\")\n\nReview: Fairy Queen\n\nPlay the Fairy Queen slot for a massive 9000x jackpot during Free Spins. Land five of the highest paying symbols during regular play to win 900x coins. This five-reel, ten-payline game has the ability to impress even the most demanding slot players.\nFairy Queen is a fantastic and tranquil game that is here to fill your pockets with cash!\n\nFantasy Graphics\n\nThe online slot Fairy Queen will look familiar to those who have played some of the card games involving magical and strange creatures. But don't let that discourage you. What we have here is an all-round online slot that looks cute but offers the glow of a real gambling machine. The game's symbols have all been drawn with bright colors that play well on the dreamy and mysterious background.\nThe highest paying symbol is the Wild, which is the Fairy Queen herself, a crowned beauty who seems to be prolific in magic. It's no wonder that Free Spins come with landing three Scatter symbols anywhere on the reel set. The other game symbols are the letters and numbers of the cards nine, ten, jack, queen, king, and ace.\nThese are the low-value symbols, while the high-value ones are the purple mushroom and bizarre flower, the pink fairy dragon, the elf with the cute hat, and the tree that has a human face and seems to be one of the kindest people in the world. The Scatter symbol carries the feature of the Fairy Queen slot's free spins.\nThe rest of the game's design features are equally spectacular. The game offers great reel action on a 95.09% Return to Player that is quite solid. Then the music score is quite pleasant, and the settings are easy to configure.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe highest paying symbol is the wild symbol of the Fairy Queen, which carries 900x coins when you land five. The score of this combination with the possibility of a Wild symbol can be a bit difficult, but this is why landing three of the Scatter symbols of the Portal of Lights is not. This combination carries the feature of ten free bonus spins. During this feature, a special symbol is housed in the first and sometimes the second reel. This symbol has the chance to randomly expand on reels one to three. In any case, free spins bring guaranteed winning combinations, and we believe this is the experience of all players who have stayed with this game long enough to activate the game feature. Plus, free spins can be retrieved during the feature by landing additional combinations of three Portal of Lights symbols.\nThis game has a very nice Return to Player outcome. Given the feature of the reactivatable free spins and the benevolent random payout generator, the RTP seems awkwardly high compared to other online slots.\nBut we're not just here to marvel. Playing the game can lead to a fun walk through the Fairy Queen slot forest, where there are many fruits hanging and the two big cash prizes that are very possible to get on a lucky try during the Free Spins feature.\nFind some of the red flowers or forest mushrooms preferred by fairies and you could win up to 250,000 coins, while catching the hypnotic flight of butterfly dragons can win you up to 400,000 coins, and finding the tree men or Pixies is even more rewarding with prizes up to 750,000 coins. However, even these tremendous prizes are not that magical: you can win up to 7,500,000 coins to find the Magical Lights of the Fairies and up to 9,000,000 coins to find the Queen.\nThe Queen also likes to unleash her bonuses and loves to enchant other symbols so she can substitute them to contribute to even more winning lines. Meanwhile, 3 or more Scattered Fairy Lights will trigger 10 free games where every game is guaranteed to win a prize. All of these prizes, and any other prizes, can also be bet on the Turn-A-Card gamble Feature. Just predict whether the card will be red or black to double your money.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nSpin for the chance to win on 10 or 20 paylines on the Fire Queen slot by Amatic. The game has a 3x5 layout and a credit range between 20 and 1000. The highest payouts are made with the castle symbol which pays 1000x on the payline bet for five.\n            ",

A 9000x jackpot is up for grabs during Free Spins, and players can win 900x coins by landing five of the highest paying symbols during regular play. Even the most demanding slot players can enjoy Fairy Queen.\n\nGraphics and Symbols\n\nFairy Queen is a fantasy-themed online slot that features a dreamy and mysterious background. The game's symbols have been drawn with bright colors and include low-value symbols like the letters and numbers of the cards nine, ten, jack, queen, king, and ace, while high-value ones are the purple mushroom and bizarre flower, the pink fairy dragon, the elf with a cute hat, and the tree with a human face. The highest paying symbol is the Wild, represented by the Fairy Queen herself as she is prolific in magic. The Scatter symbol carries the game's free spins feature.\n\nWild and Scatter Symbols\n\nThe Fairy Queen is the game's Wild symbol and can substitute for all other symbols except for the Scatter symbol. The Scatter symbol is represented by the Portal of Lights and landing three of them anywhere on the reels triggers the ten free bonus spins feature. During this feature, a special symbol is housed in the first and sometimes second reel. This symbol has the chance to randomly expand on reels one to three. Free spins can be re-triggered by landing additional combinations of three Portal of Lights symbols.\n\nReturn to Player and Betting Features\n\nFairy Queen offers a solid RTP of 95.09% and provides excellent reel action. The game's reactivatable free spins feature and benevolent random payout generator contribute to the high RTP. In addition to the regular payouts, players can also bet their winnings on the Turn-A-Card gamble feature and double their money by predicting whether the card will be red or black.\n\nFree Spins and Bonus Spins\n\nFairy Queen offers a free bonus spins feature when players land three or more Portal of Lights Scatter symbols. During this feature, a special symbol is housed in the first and sometimes second reel, with the chance to expand on reels one to three. Free spins can be re-triggered by landing additional combinations of three Portal of Lights symbols, and all games are guaranteed to win a prize.\n\nComparison to Other Slot Games\n\nFairy Queen stands out from other games with its fantasy-themed background and symbols. Similar slot games include the Fire Queen slot by Amatic, which features 10 or 20 paylines, a 3x5 layout, and a credit range between 20 and 1000. The highest payouts are made with the castle symbol, which pays 1000x on the payline bet for five.\n\n        \n            ",

Land five of the highest paying symbols during regular play to win 900x coins. This five-reel, ten-payline game has the ability to impress even the most demanding slot players.\nFairy Queen is a fantastic and tranquil game that is here to fill your pockets with cash!\n\nFantasy Graphics\n\nThe online slot Fairy Queen will look familiar to those who have played some of the card games involving magical and strange creatures. But don't let that discourage you. What we have here is an all-round online slot that looks cute but offers the glow of a real gambling machine. The game's symbols have all been drawn with bright colors that play well on the dreamy and mysterious background.\nThe highest paying symbol is the Wild, which is the Fairy Queen herself, a crowned beauty who seems to be prolific in magic. It's no wonder that Free Spins come with landing three Scatter symbols anywhere on the reel set. The other game symbols are the letters and numbers of the cards nine, ten, jack, queen, king, and ace.\nThese are the low-value symbols, while the high-value ones are the purple mushroom and bizarre flower, the pink fairy dragon, the elf with the cute hat, and the tree that has a human face and seems to be one of the kindest people in the world. The Scatter symbol carries the feature of the Fairy Queen slot's free spins.\nThe rest of the game's design features are equally spectacular. The game offers great reel action on a 95.09% Return to Player that is quite solid. Then the music score is quite pleasant, and the settings are easy to configure.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe highest paying symbol is the wild symbol of the Fairy Queen, which carries 900x coins when you land five. The score of this combination with the possibility of a Wild symbol can be a bit difficult, but this is why landing three of the Scatter symbols of the Portal of Lights is not. This combination carries the feature of ten free bonus spins. During this feature, a special symbol is housed in the first and sometimes the second reel. This symbol has the chance to randomly expand on reels one to three. In any case, free spins bring guaranteed winning combinations, and we believe this is the experience of all players who have stayed with this game long enough to activate the game feature. Plus, free spins can be retrieved during the feature by landing additional combinations of three Portal of Lights symbols.\nThis game has a very nice Return to Player outcome. Given the feature of the reactivatable free spins and the benevolent random payout generator, the RTP seems awkwardly high compared to other online slots.\nBut we're not just here to marvel. Playing the game can lead to a fun walk through the Fairy Queen slot forest, where there are many fruits hanging and the two big cash prizes that are very possible to get on a lucky try during the Free Spins feature.\nFind some of the red flowers or forest mushrooms preferred by fairies and you could win up to 250,000 coins, while catching the hypnotic flight of butterfly dragons can win you up to 400,000 coins, and finding the tree men or Pixies is even more rewarding with prizes up to 750,000 coins. However, even these tremendous prizes are not that magical: you can win up to 7,500,000 coins to find the Magical Lights of the Fairies and up to 9,000,000 coins to find the Queen.\nThe Queen also likes to unleash her bonuses and loves to enchant other symbols so she can substitute them to contribute to even more winning lines. Meanwhile, 3 or more Scattered Fairy Lights will trigger 10 free games where every game is guaranteed to win a prize. All of these prizes, and any other prizes, can also be bet on the Turn-A-Card gamble Feature. Just predict whether the card will be red or black to double your money.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nSpin for the chance to win on 10 or 20 paylines on the Fire Queen slot by Amatic. The game has a 3x5 layout and a credit range between 20 and 1000. The highest payouts are made with the castle symbol which pays 1000x on the payline bet for five.\n            ",

Then the music score is quite pleasant, and the settings are easy to configure.\n\nFunctions and Symbols of the Slot Machine\n\nThe highest paying symbol is the wild symbol of the Fairy Queen, which carries 900x coins when you land five. The score of this combination with the possibility of a Wild symbol can be a bit difficult, but this is why landing three of the Scatter symbols of the Portal of Lights is not. This combination carries the feature of ten free bonus spins. During this feature, a special symbol is housed in the first and sometimes the second reel. This symbol has the chance to randomly expand on reels one to three. In any case, free spins bring guaranteed winning combinations, and we believe this is the experience of all players who have stayed with this game long enough to activate the game feature. Plus, free spins can be retrieved during the feature by landing additional combinations of three Portal of Lights symbols.\nThis game has a very nice Return to Player outcome. Given the feature of the reactivatable free spins and the benevolent random payout generator, the RTP seems awkwardly high compared to other online slots.\nBut we're not just here to marvel. Playing the game can lead to a fun walk through the Fairy Queen slot forest, where there are many fruits hanging and the two big cash prizes that are very possible to get on a lucky try during the Free Spins feature.\nFind some of the red flowers or forest mushrooms preferred by fairies and you could win up to 250,000 coins, while catching the hypnotic flight of butterfly dragons can win you up to 400,000 coins, and finding the tree men or Pixies is even more rewarding with prizes up to 750,000 coins. However, even these tremendous prizes are not that magical: you can win up to 7,500,000 coins to find the Magical Lights of the Fairies and up to 9,000,000 coins to find the Queen.\nThe Queen also likes to unleash her bonuses and loves to enchant other symbols so she can substitute them to contribute to even more winning lines. Meanwhile, 3 or more Scattered Fairy Lights will trigger 10 free games where every game is guaranteed to win a prize. All of these prizes, and any other prizes, can also be bet on the Turn-A-Card gamble Feature. Just predict whether the card will be red or black to double your money.\n\nSimilar Slot Machines\n\nSpin for the chance to win on 10 or 20 paylines on the Fire Queen slot by Amatic. The game has a 3x5 layout and a credit range between 20 and 1000. The highest payouts are made with the castle symbol which pays 1000x on the payline bet for five.\n            ",

But don't let that discourage you. What we have here is an all-round online slot that looks cute but offers the glow of a real gambling machine. The game's symbols have all been drawn with bright colors that play well on the dreamy and mysterious background.\nThe highest paying symbol is the Wild, which is the Fairy Queen herself, a crowned beauty who seems to be prolific in magic. It's no wonder that Free Spins come with landing three Scatter symbols anywhere on the reel set. The other game symbols are the letters and numbers of the cards nine, ten, jack, queen, king, and ace.\nThese are the low-value symbols, while the high-value ones are the purple mushroom and bizarre flower, the pink fairy dragon, the elf with the cute hat, and the tree that has a human face and seems to be one of the kindest people in the world. The Scatter symbol carries the feature of the Fairy Queen slot's free spins.\nThe rest of the game's design features are equally spectacular.
