First of all, you will play on a larger layout thanks to the introduction of 6 reels. Secondly, the element of volatility customization, which has become the trademark of this provider, will make the game even more dynamic. Finally, there is an interesting Paytable and some great features... So, what are you waiting for? \n\nTheme and main symbols of Black Horse Deluxe\nThe inspiration for this downloadable slot game from developer Wazdan comes directly from the Wild West. In the background, the scenery is a prairie at sunset, but there is something else besides cowboys, cowgirls, and their props. By implementing classic fruit symbols (plums, cherries, grapes, oranges), Wazdan has created a slot with a hybrid theme that our players really enjoy! In particular:\n- Cowboy, cowgirl, hats, and cactus are the most rewarding symbols\n- The Golden Horseshoe is the Scatter\n- The game logo is the Wild symbol.\n\nWhat are the betting options?\nThe game accepts bets ranging from 0.10 to 100 coins per strike. It's not the widest range of bets, but it certainly suits most bettors. By spinning these 6 reels, you can get the maximum payout of 1,300 times the bet. And if we add the theoretical return to player of 96.15%, it's clear that we're talking about a slot with a good payout. In the introductory part, I mentioned the option of volatility customization – something we often see in Wazdan's versions. In practice, you will be able to choose the level of volatility (low, medium, high) based on your personal preferences.\n\nFree Spins and Gamble feature of Black Horse Deluxe\nThe game logo acts as a Wild symbol, replacing all regular symbols except the Scatter which allows you to form even more combinations. Land 3 golden horseshoes anywhere on the grid and you'll activate the most profitable feature of the game – Free Spins. During the feature, the Wild Stallion will be there to help you! By forming more wins, you will fill up the Bonus signal. Once full, you will start collecting gold coins and with a maximum of 6, the Black Horse Spins will be activated. \n\nIn addition, you will have an extra feature called Gamble, where you will be asked to participate and win in the popular horseshoe toss competition to double your winnings. Remember, if you lose a single shot, you lose everything!\n\nFinal thoughts on Black Horse Deluxe\nWazdan ended 2019 in style and prepared some rather interesting surprises for us in 2020.

Black Horse Deluxe is a free video slot with some revolutionary elements brought by Wazdan. First of all, you will play on a larger layout thanks to the introduction of 6 reels. Secondly, the element of volatility customization, which has become the hallmark of this provider, will make the game even more dynamic. Finally, there is an interesting Paytable and some great features... So, what are you waiting for? Let's read on!\n\nTheme and main symbols of Black Horse Deluxe \n\nThe inspiration for this no-download slot by Wazdan comes directly from the Wild West. In the background, the scenario is that of a sunset prairie, but there is something else beyond cowboys, cowgirls, and their props. Implementing classic fruit symbols (plums, cherries, grapes, oranges), Wazdan has created a hybrid themed slot, and I must say that our players really like this unusual aspect! In particular:\n\n- Cowboy, cowgirl, hats, and cacti are more rewarding symbols\n- The golden Horseshoe is the Scatter\n- The game logo is the Wild symbol.\n\nWhat are the betting options?\n\nThe game accepts bets in the range between 0.10 and 100 coins per spin. It may not be the widest betting range, but it certainly suits most bettors. Spinning these 6 reels can get you the maximum payout of 1,300 times your bet, and if we add the theoretical Return to Player of 96.15%, it's clear that we're talking about a slot with a good payout. In the introductory part, I mentioned the option of volatility customization - something we often see in Wazdan versions. In practice, you will be able to choose the volatility level (low, medium, high) based on your personal preferences.\n\nFree Spins feature and Gamble in Black Horse Deluxe\n\nThe game logo acts as a Wild symbol replacing all regular symbols except for the Scatter, which allows you to form even more combinations. Land 3 golden horseshoes anywhere on the grid and activate the Free Spins feature, the most profitable of the game. During the feature, the Wild Stallion will be there to help you! By forming more wins, you will fill the Bonus signal. Once full, you will start collecting gold coins, and with a maximum of 6, the Black Horse Spins will be activated.\n\nAdditionally, you will have an extra feature called Gamble, where you will be asked to participate and win in the popular horseshoe toss competition to double your winnings.

Black Horse Deluxe is a free video slot with some revolutionary elements brought by Wazdan. First of all, you will play on a larger layout thanks to the introduction of 6 reels. Secondly, the element of volatility customization, which has become the hallmark of this provider, will make the game even more dynamic. Finally, there is an interesting Paytable and some great features... So, what are you waiting for? Let's read on!\n\nTheme and main symbols of Black Horse Deluxe \n\nThe inspiration for this no-download slot by Wazdan comes directly from the Wild West. In the background, the scenario is that of a sunset prairie, but there is something else beyond cowboys, cowgirls, and their props. Implementing classic fruit symbols (plums, cherries, grapes, oranges), Wazdan has created a hybrid themed slot, and I must say that our players really like this unusual aspect! In particular:\n\n- Cowboy, cowgirl, hats, and cacti are more rewarding symbols\n- The golden Horseshoe is the Scatter\n- The game logo is the Wild symbol.\n\nWhat are the betting options?\n\nThe game accepts bets in the range between 0.10 and 100 coins per spin. It may not be the widest betting range, but it certainly suits most bettors. Spinning these 6 reels can get you the maximum payout of 1,300 times your bet, and if we add the theoretical Return to Player of 96.15%, it's clear that we're talking about a slot with a good payout. In the introductory part, I mentioned the option of volatility customization - something we often see in Wazdan versions. In practice, you will be able to choose the volatility level (low, medium, high) based on your personal preferences.\n\nFree Spins feature and Gamble in Black Horse Deluxe\n\nThe game logo acts as a Wild symbol replacing all regular symbols except for the Scatter, which allows you to form even more combinations. Land 3 golden horseshoes anywhere on the grid and activate the Free Spins feature, the most profitable of the game. During the feature, the Wild Stallion will be there to help you! By forming more wins, you will fill the Bonus signal. Once full, you will start collecting gold coins, and with a maximum of 6, the Black Horse Spins will be activated.\n\nAdditionally, you will have an extra feature called Gamble, where you will be asked to participate and win in the popular horseshoe toss competition to double your winnings. Remember that if you lose a single flip, you lose everything!\n\nFinal thoughts on Black Horse Deluxe \n\nWazdan has ended 2019 in great style and has prepared some rather interesting surprises for us in 2020. Black Horse Deluxe may not be the most original title of the year among those in our showcase of over 1390 free slots, but with its features, options, and high payouts, it will definitely enter the hearts of many horse-loving slot enthusiasts.\n\nFAQ - Most frequently asked questions about Black Horse Deluxe\n\nWhat is the Gamble feature?\n\nDuring the game, you can participate in a horse shoe toss race and double your winnings.\n\nWhat is the variance customization option?\n\nThe volatility in this game can be changed at will, so you can decide how to set it based on 3 options: low, medium, high.\n\nCan I play Black Horse Deluxe for free?\n\nOf course, Wazdan has released the game as a free demo, allowing anyone to try it for free before deciding whether to try betting with real money.\n\nHow do Free Spins work during the game?\n\nFree Spins come with the cascading win system that removes winning symbols and replaces them with new ones. Each cascading win creates a multiplier: up to x4 in the base game and up to 8x in the extra feature.\n\nWhat is the RTP in this no-registration slot?\n\nIn this game, the RTP is 96.15%.\n            ",

Black Horse Deluxe is a free video slot with some revolutionary elements brought by Wazdan. First of all, you will play on a larger layout thanks to the introduction of 6 reels. Secondly, the element of volatility customization, which has become the hallmark of this provider, will make the game even more dynamic. Finally, there is an interesting Paytable and some great features... So, what are you waiting for? Let's read on!\n\nTheme and main symbols of Black Horse Deluxe \n\nThe inspiration for this no-download slot by Wazdan comes directly from the Wild West. In the background, the scenario is that of a sunset prairie, but there is something else beyond cowboys, cowgirls, and their props. Implementing classic fruit symbols (plums, cherries, grapes, oranges), Wazdan has created a hybrid themed slot, and I must say that our players really like this unusual aspect! In particular:\n\n- Cowboy, cowgirl, hats, and cacti are more rewarding symbols\n- The golden Horseshoe is the Scatter\n- The game logo is the Wild symbol.\n\nWhat are the betting options?\n\nThe game accepts bets in the range between 0.10 and 100 coins per spin. It may not be the widest betting range, but it certainly suits most bettors. Spinning these 6 reels can get you the maximum payout of 1,300 times your bet, and if we add the theoretical Return to Player of 96.15%, it's clear that we're talking about a slot with a good payout. In the introductory part, I mentioned the option of volatility customization - something we often see in Wazdan versions. In practice, you will be able to choose the volatility level (low, medium, high) based on your personal preferences.\n\nFree Spins feature and Gamble in Black Horse Deluxe\n\nThe game logo acts as a Wild symbol replacing all regular symbols except for the Scatter, which allows you to form even more combinations. Land 3 golden horseshoes anywhere on the grid and activate the Free Spins feature, the most profitable of the game. During the feature, the Wild Stallion will be there to help you! By forming more wins, you will fill the Bonus signal. Once full, you will start collecting gold coins, and with a maximum of 6, the Black Horse Spins will be activated.\n\nAdditionally, you will have an extra feature called Gamble, where you will be asked to participate and win in the popular horseshoe toss competition to double your winnings. Remember that if you lose a single flip, you lose everything!\n\nFinal thoughts on Black Horse Deluxe \n\nWazdan has ended 2019 in great style and has prepared some rather interesting surprises for us in 2020. Black Horse Deluxe may not be the most original title of the year among those in our showcase of over 1390 free slots, but with its features, options, and high payouts, it will definitely enter the hearts of many horse-loving slot enthusiasts.\n\nFAQ - Most frequently asked questions about Black Horse Deluxe\n\nWhat is the Gamble feature?\n\nDuring the game, you can participate in a horse shoe toss race and double your winnings.\n\nWhat is the variance customization option?\n\nThe volatility in this game can be changed at will, so you can decide how to set it based on 3 options: low, medium, high.\n\nCan I play Black Horse Deluxe for free?\n\nOf course, Wazdan has released the game as a free demo, allowing anyone to try it for free before deciding whether to try betting with real money.\n\nHow do Free Spins work during the game?\n\nFree Spins come with the cascading win system that removes winning symbols and replaces them with new ones.

In particular:\n\n- Cowboy, cowgirl, hats, and cacti are more rewarding symbols\n- The golden Horseshoe is the Scatter\n- The game logo is the Wild symbol.\n\nWhat are the betting options?\n\nThe game accepts bets in the range between 0.10 and 100 coins per spin. It may not be the widest betting range, but it certainly suits most bettors. Spinning these 6 reels can get you the maximum payout of 1,300 times your bet, and if we add the theoretical Return to Player of 96.15%, it's clear that we're talking about a slot with a good payout. In the introductory part, I mentioned the option of volatility customization - something we often see in Wazdan versions. In practice, you will be able to choose the volatility level (low, medium, high) based on your personal preferences.\n\nFree Spins feature and Gamble in Black Horse Deluxe\n\nThe game logo acts as a Wild symbol replacing all regular symbols except for the Scatter, which allows you to form even more combinations. Land 3 golden horseshoes anywhere on the grid and activate the Free Spins feature, the most profitable of the game. During the feature, the Wild Stallion will be there to help you! By forming more wins, you will fill the Bonus signal. Once full, you will start collecting gold coins, and with a maximum of 6, the Black Horse Spins will be activated.\n\nAdditionally, you will have an extra feature called Gamble, where you will be asked to participate and win in the popular horseshoe toss competition to double your winnings. Remember that if you lose a single flip, you lose everything!\n\nFinal thoughts on Black Horse Deluxe \n\nWazdan has ended 2019 in great style and has prepared some rather interesting surprises for us in 2020. Black Horse Deluxe may not be the most original title of the year among those in our showcase of over 1390 free slots, but with its features, options, and high payouts, it will definitely enter the hearts of many horse-loving slot enthusiasts.\n\nFAQ - Most frequently asked questions about Black Horse Deluxe\n\nWhat is the Gamble feature?\n\nDuring the game, you can participate in a horse shoe toss race and double your winnings.\n\nWhat is the variance customization option?\n\nThe volatility in this game can be changed at will, so you can decide how to set it based on 3 options: low, medium, high.\n\nCan I play Black Horse Deluxe for free?\n\nOf course, Wazdan has released the game as a free demo, allowing anyone to try it for free before deciding whether to try betting with real money.\n\nHow do Free Spins work during the game?\n\nFree Spins come with the cascading win system that removes winning symbols and replaces them with new ones.
