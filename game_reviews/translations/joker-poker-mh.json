Si tratta di una slot machine online che è stata firmata da Play’n Go con l’obiettivo di presentare sul mercato un titolo che fosse molto intuitivo e remunerativo. Se provi questa macchinetta non ti aspettare grafiche da capogiro ed effetti speciali capaci di stupirti. Perché questo video poker è essenziale e pulito, ben oltre a quanto abbiamo avuto modo di vedere fino a oggi. I suoi obiettivi sono ben descritti dal nome stesso della slot, che presenta un mazzo di 53 carte con un Joker, che è ovviamente il jolly. E’ usato per aumentare la possibilità di creare delle combinazioni vincenti durante la partita e le sue 100 mani. Il gameplay è affidato totalmente al caso e quindi diventa impossibile prevedere le vincite. Tutto ciò che ogni giocatore sa quando si siede al tavolo è che la sua scommessa minima è pari a 1 fino a un massimo di 5, e potrà sempre contare sulla tabella dei pagamenti che è fissa nella parte alta dello schermo. Vediamo insieme quali sono le particolarità di questo gioco e come si svolgeranno le diverse mani!\nGrafica e simboli di gioco\nJoker Poker MH è uno dei grandi classici per gli appassionati del gioco d’azzardo. Non si presenta con una grafica eccentrica e accattivante, ma mantiene estrema pulizia. Appena si avvia il gioco ti troverai seduto di fronte alle tue carte: avviando il giro potrai svelare quali sono le figure che sono state a te assegnate. In modo molto semplice potrai decidere quali carte tenere e quali cambiare prima di sfidare la fortuna e tentare di realizzare delle combinazioni fortunate. Tra queste troviamo:\n\nScala reale massima;\nPokerissimo;\nScala reale massima con jolly;\nLa Scala reale;\nPoker;\nFull;\nColore;\nScala;\nTrip;\nDoppia coppia.\n\nNell’angolo destro dello schermo trovi le impostazioni che ti permettono di stabilire che tipo di scommessa fare in base alla mano che affronterai. In base ai moltiplicatori che trovi quando realizzi delle vincite, hai la possibilità di fruttare un bonus game che potrà far aumentare il valore del credito. Se, per esempio, riesci a indovinare l’uscita del seme delle carte, le tue vincite sono raddoppiate per quattro volte. Non vi sono altre particolarità degne di nota, perché mancano i simboli Scatter o Wild, ma potrai puntare all’aumento della vittoria solo dopo aver realizzato una combinazione fortunata.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot\nJoker Poker MH non è una slot per tutti, ma un prodotto di nicchia che saprà attirare a se i giocatori più solitari e determinati, che vogliono semplicemente giocare un po’ di sano poker. La determinazione può spingerti a voler capire le combinazioni e sfidare la sorte, allenandoti anche attraverso la versione demo del gioco. Si perde un po’ di empatia con il game però, anche a livello di adrenalina e divertimento. La competizione tipica del poker viene meno e per questo non lo consideriamo come un prodotto che possa essere adatto a tutti i gamer. Ma è pur sempre da provare, del resto presenta una buona percentuale di RTP che si ferma a quota 95,01%.\n",

The game has a deck of 53 cards which include a joker that increases the chances of landing winning combinations. The bets range from 1 to 5, and the paytable is always visible on the top of the screen. The game doesn't have Scatter or Wild symbols, but it features a bonus game that will multiply the winnings if you guess the suit of the next card correctly.\n\nDeck of Cards\n\nJoker Poker MH features a standard deck of 52 cards, plus a joker card that acts as a Wild symbol to complement any winning combination. Players can bet with a minimum of 1 coin and a maximum of 5 coins on each hand. Before betting, check the paytable that shows the potential payouts on each hand combination. The deck of cards is shuffled each round, making it impossible to predict when you'll come out on top.\n\nBonus Game\n\nJoker Poker MH offers a bonus game that multiplies winnings if you guess the suit of the next card correctly. After winning, you can choose to collect your winnings or gamble them in the bonus game. In the bonus game, you'll need to guess whether the next card will be a spade, a club, a diamond, or a heart. If you guess correctly, your winnings will be multiplied by four. However, if you guess wrong, you'll lose the original winnings.\n\nWinning Combinations\n\nJoker Poker MH offers several winning combinations, including a pair of Kings or better, two pairs, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, five of a kind, a wild royal flush, and a natural royal flush. The minimum combination to win is a pair of Kings, and the highest payout is awarded for a Natural Royal Flush. Players can choose which cards to hold or discard before making the next draw, which adds an aspect of strategy to the game.\n\nDemo Version\n\nJoker Poker MH has a demo version that is available for players who want to refine their skills before betting real money. The demo version is identical to the real-money version, and players can get familiarized with the gameplay, winning combinations, and bonus game features before deciding to make a wager. The game has an RTP of 95.01%, making it a decent choice for those looking for a classic poker experience.\n\n        \n            ",
