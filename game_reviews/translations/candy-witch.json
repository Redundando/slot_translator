            "response": "The Candy Witch slot by SimplePlay is set in an enchanted forest, illuminated by moonlight. Here, a fierce battle between an evil witch and a young magician takes place. Let's start by saying that the graphics of this slot game are absolutely fantastic, with detailed symbols and a well-made cartoon style. The magic spells and animations cast by the two opponents add dynamic action to every play, with the grid bending with every charm. The witch is suspended mid-air on the right side, while the magician is on the left. The frame around the reels is a sweet sponge cake, but don't let its appearance fool you. At the top corners are the two counters that determine the two bonus games, which we will focus on shortly.\n\nFeatures of the slot game:\n\nIn Candy Witch, we have a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, with 30 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is 0.20 coins, which can be adjusted according to your preference. With the Autoplay option, you can choose the number of automatic spins between 50 and 1,000. By clicking on the lightning icon, you can speed up the rotation of the reels. The volatility is medium, which means there is a good balance between bets placed and winnings. The RTP value is 96.19%.\n\nSymbols and Bonus:\n\nThere are twelve basic symbols in Candy Witch, evenly divided between those of low and high value. The first group includes the playing cards from 9 to Ace. The rewarding symbols are those related to the Candy Witch theme, such as the young boy in prison, the Halloween pumpkin, the bottle of candy, the bag of sweets, and the first version of the two witches. The golden ring is our Wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatters. There are two Scatters in this game: the witch and the magician, represented while preparing to cast their magic. Here we come to the Bonus game. As mentioned earlier, the two protagonists are on the sides of the grid. Each time one or more Scatter symbols land on the reels, a spell is cast on the opponent, and the corresponding counter is updated. When the threshold of 80 for the witch and 60 for the magician is reached, the bonus game is activated.\n\nThe bonus game linked to the witch grants 12 free spins, and with each spin, the number of Sticky Wilds increases, up to a maximum of 48. The bonus activated by the magician also grants 12 free spins, but with each round, we will have a progressive multiplier, up to a maximum of x24!",

Here, a fierce battle between an evil witch and a young magician takes place. Let's start by saying that the graphics of this slot game are absolutely fantastic, with detailed symbols and a well-made cartoon style. The magic spells and animations cast by the two opponents add dynamic action to every play, with the grid bending with every charm. The witch is suspended mid-air on the right side, while the magician is on the left. The frame around the reels is a sweet sponge cake, but don't let its appearance fool you. At the top corners are the two counters that determine the two bonus games, which we will focus on shortly.\n\nFeatures of the slot game:\n\nIn Candy Witch, we have a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, with 30 fixed paylines.

The RTP value is 96.19%.\n\nSymbols and Bonus:\n\nThere are twelve basic symbols in Candy Witch, evenly divided between those of low and high value. The first group includes the playing cards from 9 to Ace. The rewarding symbols are those related to the Candy Witch theme, such as the young boy in prison, the Halloween pumpkin, the bottle of candy, the bag of sweets, and the first version of the two witches. The golden ring is our Wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatters.

Here, a fierce battle between an evil witch and a young magician takes place. Let's start by saying that the graphics of this slot game are absolutely fantastic, with detailed symbols and a well-made cartoon style. The magic spells and animations cast by the two opponents add dynamic action to every play, with the grid bending with every charm. The witch is suspended mid-air on the right side, while the magician is on the left. The frame around the reels is a sweet sponge cake, but don't let its appearance fool you. At the top corners are the two counters that determine the two bonus games, which we will focus on shortly.\n\nFeatures of the slot game:\n\nIn Candy Witch, we have a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, with 30 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is 0.20 coins, which can be adjusted according to your preference. With the Autoplay option, you can choose the number of automatic spins between 50 and 1,000. By clicking on the lightning icon, you can speed up the rotation of the reels. The volatility is medium, which means there is a good balance between bets placed and winnings. The RTP value is 96.19%.\n\nSymbols and Bonus:\n\nThere are twelve basic symbols in Candy Witch, evenly divided between those of low and high value. The first group includes the playing cards from 9 to Ace. The rewarding symbols are those related to the Candy Witch theme, such as the young boy in prison, the Halloween pumpkin, the bottle of candy, the bag of sweets, and the first version of the two witches. The golden ring is our Wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatters. There are two Scatters in this game: the witch and the magician, represented while preparing to cast their magic. Here we come to the Bonus game. As mentioned earlier, the two protagonists are on the sides of the grid. Each time one or more Scatter symbols land on the reels, a spell is cast on the opponent, and the corresponding counter is updated. When the threshold of 80 for the witch and 60 for the magician is reached, the bonus game is activated.\n\nThe bonus game linked to the witch grants 12 free spins, and with each spin, the number of Sticky Wilds increases, up to a maximum of 48. The bonus activated by the magician also grants 12 free spins, but with each round, we will have a progressive multiplier, up to a maximum of x24!\n            ",

Here, a fierce battle between an evil witch and a young magician takes place. Let's start by saying that the graphics of this slot game are absolutely fantastic, with detailed symbols and a well-made cartoon style. The magic spells and animations cast by the two opponents add dynamic action to every play, with the grid bending with every charm. The witch is suspended mid-air on the right side, while the magician is on the left. The frame around the reels is a sweet sponge cake, but don't let its appearance fool you. At the top corners are the two counters that determine the two bonus games, which we will focus on shortly.\n\nFeatures of the slot game:\n\nIn Candy Witch, we have a classic grid with 5 reels and 3 rows, with 30 fixed paylines. The minimum bet is 0.20 coins, which can be adjusted according to your preference. With the Autoplay option, you can choose the number of automatic spins between 50 and 1,000. By clicking on the lightning icon, you can speed up the rotation of the reels. The volatility is medium, which means there is a good balance between bets placed and winnings. The RTP value is 96.19%.\n\nSymbols and Bonus:\n\nThere are twelve basic symbols in Candy Witch, evenly divided between those of low and high value. The first group includes the playing cards from 9 to Ace. The rewarding symbols are those related to the Candy Witch theme, such as the young boy in prison, the Halloween pumpkin, the bottle of candy, the bag of sweets, and the first version of the two witches. The golden ring is our Wild symbol and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatters. There are two Scatters in this game: the witch and the magician, represented while preparing to cast their magic. Here we come to the Bonus game. As mentioned earlier, the two protagonists are on the sides of the grid. Each time one or more Scatter symbols land on the reels, a spell is cast on the opponent, and the corresponding counter is updated. When the threshold of 80 for the witch and 60 for the magician is reached, the bonus game is activated.\n\nThe bonus game linked to the witch grants 12 free spins, and with each spin, the number of Sticky Wilds increases, up to a maximum of 48. The bonus activated by the magician also grants 12 free spins, but with each round, we will have a progressive multiplier, up to a maximum of x24!\n            ",
