Qui incontrerai poteri e libri da sfogliare, utili per sperimentare la magia sulla griglia di gioco. Cerca di ottenere abbastanza potere per mettere mano sui giri speciali dove i premi diventano più consistenti. Non ci sono particolari animazioni, mentre è molto misteriosa e decisa la colonna sonora che scandisce le scommesse e i giri sui rulli.\nCaratteristiche e funzionalità speciali\nLa slot prevede 5 rulli e 20 linee di pagamento per una griglia di gioco che si posiziona su un laboratorio misterioso. Il tuo scopo è di realizzare delle combinazioni da sinistra a destra, personalizzando le tue scommesse e le puntate sui numeri di linee attive. Come simboli di gioco abbiamo le carte Reali, che vanno dal 9 all’Asso. Si passa poi alle gemme colorate, al numero 7 fortunato e fiammeggiante, E infine arriviamo al Mago, che da solo ti può far vincere fino a 750 volte la tua puntata se ne appaiono 5. Ma non è finita: se riesci a mettere mano sui Libri, più precisamente su 5 libri di stregoneria, allora puoi vincere 5.000 volte la tua scommessa.\nL’unico bonus che troverai 10 giri gratuiti, che pagano con un moltiplicatore 2x: una piccola speranza positiva di ottenere qualche vincita in più rispetto al gioco base.\nConsiderazioni finali sulla slot Lines of Magic\nSicuramente è una slot dinamica, che mantiene fede alle caratteristiche del suo provider: poche funzioni speciali ma tanta voglia di riproporre macchinette che strizzino l’occhio ai classici dei casinò.

Wave your magic wand and try to uncover the mysterious treasures contained on the game reels of this machine with an RTP of 95.92%. Are you ready to cast your spell?\nSlot Graphics\nA beautiful slot, not too innovative or complicated, but with good potential. You can open the game and immediately start spinning the reels that will take you into a real battle. Here you will encounter powers and books to flip through, useful for experimenting with magic on the game grid.

Your goal is to make combinations from left to right, customizing your bets and bets on active line numbers. As game symbols we have the Royal cards, ranging from 9 to Ace. We then move on to colored gems, the lucky and flaming number 7. Finally, we come to the Wizard, who alone can earn you up to 750 times your bet if 5 appear. But it's not over: if you can get your hands on the Books, more precisely on 5 books of witchcraft, then you can win 5,000 times your bet.\nThe only bonus you'll find is 10 free spins, paying with a 2x multiplier: a small positive hope of getting some extra winnings compared to the base game.\nFinal Thoughts on Lines of Magic Slot\nIt is definitely a dynamic slot that lives up to the characteristics of its provider: few special functions but a strong desire to offer machines that nod to the classics of casinos.

Wave your magic wand and try to uncover the mysterious treasures contained on the game reels of this machine with an RTP of 95.92%. Are you ready to cast your spell?\nSlot Graphics\nA beautiful slot, not too innovative or complicated, but with good potential. You can open the game and immediately start spinning the reels that will take you into a real battle. Here you will encounter powers and books to flip through, useful for experimenting with magic on the game grid. Try to gain enough power to get your hands on special spins where the prizes become more substantial. There are no particular animations, while the soundtrack that accompanies bets and spins on the reels is very mysterious and determined.\nSpecial Features and Functions\nThe slot features 5 reels and 20 paylines for a game grid that is positioned in a mysterious laboratory. Your goal is to make combinations from left to right, customizing your bets and bets on active line numbers. As game symbols we have the Royal cards, ranging from 9 to Ace. We then move on to colored gems, the lucky and flaming number 7. Finally, we come to the Wizard, who alone can earn you up to 750 times your bet if 5 appear. But it's not over: if you can get your hands on the Books, more precisely on 5 books of witchcraft, then you can win 5,000 times your bet.\nThe only bonus you'll find is 10 free spins, paying with a 2x multiplier: a small positive hope of getting some extra winnings compared to the base game.\nFinal Thoughts on Lines of Magic Slot\nIt is definitely a dynamic slot that lives up to the characteristics of its provider: few special functions but a strong desire to offer machines that nod to the classics of casinos. If you are not passionate about magic or are looking for bonuses full of surprises... you better keep searching!\n            ",
