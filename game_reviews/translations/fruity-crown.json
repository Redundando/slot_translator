I simboli sono ben definiti e i colori sgargianti, i rulli si muovono su uno sfondo nero e ai lati della cornice sono visualizzate le linee di pagamento. Nella parte sottostante alla griglia potrete trovare il credito totale, l’ammontare della scommessa e i tasti per aumentare o diminuire il valore su ogni linea di gioco, il pulsante per impostare la scommessa massima in un colpo solo, il tasto per la rotazione manuale e quello per avviare i giri automatici. Ad accompagnare il gioco non c’è nessun effetto sonoro, ma solo il rumore della rotazione dei rulli.\nCaratteristiche principali della slot machine\nLa griglia di gioco di Fruity Crown ha 5 rulli e 4 righe, le linee di pagamento sono ben 100 e fisse, cioè non è possibile aumentare o diminuire il numero. La puntata minima è di 0,20 €, la massima 100 €. Le combinazioni paganti si sviluppano da sinistra a destra, in caso di più combinazioni vincente sulla stessa linea verrà pagata solo la più alta. Attraverso il tasto Autoplay si possono far partire i giri automatici, anche se non si può impostarne un numero definito: quando si vuole tornare alla modalità manuale basterà cliccare il tasto STOP. L’RTP è del 95,2%, non un granché a dire la verità,  e la volatilità media. Non è previsto nessun sistema di Free Spins. La vincita massima è di 1.056 volte la scommessa.\nSimboli e funzionalità di Fruity Crown\nI simboli regolari sono tutti a tema frutta, oltre al numero 7, ci sono inoltre un simbolo Wild a espansione e 2 Scatter. I simboli che pagano meno sono il limone, l’arancia, la prugna e le ciliegie, se escono per tre volte pagano 10 volte la puntata, con 5 si arriva a 100, quindi comunque si parla di cifre consistenti. La pera paga sino 400 volte e con l’anguria e l’uva si arriva a 1.000! Il numero 7 paga anche con soli 2 simboli, con 5 si arriva a 5.000 volte la puntata.

Può apparire solo sui rulli 2, 3, e 4 e in una combinazione vincente si espande, aumentando in modo esponenziale le possibilità di vincita. Fruity Crown prevede due simboli Scatter: Diamante e Oro. Il primo è rappresentato da una stella azzurra, può comparire solo sui rulli 1, 3 o 5, e ne bastano 3 per vincere 2.000 volte il valore della scommessa. Lo stella dorata può apparire su qualsiasi rullo e paga in base al numero di simboli: con 3 avremo un ritorno pari a 300 volte la puntata, con 4 stelle 2.000 volte e infine con 5 simboli raggiungeremo una vincita di 10.000 volte rispetto alla nostra scommessa!\n",

            "response": "Fruity Crown is a classic slot game that features fruit symbols, but what sets it apart are the special symbols that greatly increase your chances of winning big. Let's start by talking about the graphics, which are very well done, as you would expect from a product by Playson. The symbols are well-defined and brightly colored, and the reels move on a black background while the pay lines are displayed on the sides of the frame. Below the grid, you'll find your total credit, your bet amount, and buttons to increase or decrease the value on each pay line. There's also a button to set the maximum bet in one go, a button for manual rotation, and one for starting auto spins. The game is accompanied by no sound effects, only the sound of the reels spinning.\n\nKey Features of the Slot Machine:\nFruity Crown's game grid has 5 reels and 4 rows, with 100 fixed pay lines – meaning you can't increase or decrease the number. The minimum bet is €0.20, while the maximum bet is €100. Winning combinations pay from left to right, and in case there are several winning combinations on the same line, only the highest will be paid out. The autoplay button allows you to start automatic spins, though you can't set a specific number. To return to manual mode, simply click the STOP button. The RTP is 95.2%, which is not great to be honest, while the volatility is average. There is no free spin system and the maximum payout is 1,056 times the bet.\n\nSymbols and Functions of Fruity Crown:\nThe regular symbols are all fruit-themed, including the number 7, as well as an expanding wild symbol and two scatters. The symbols that pay the least are the lemon, orange, plum, and cherries. If these appear three times, they pay out 10 times the bet, while five of them pay out 100 times the bet – still a considerable sum. The pear pays up to 400 times, and with watermelon and grapes you can reach up to 1,000 times your bet! The number 7 also pays out with just two symbols, but with five of them, you can earn 5,000 times your bet. Among the special symbols is the crown, which acts as a wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the scatters. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, and in a winning combination, it expands exponentially, increasing your chances of winning. Fruity Crown features two scatter symbols: Diamond and Gold. The diamond is represented by a blue star, and can only appear on reels 1, 3 or 5. Three of these will win you 2,000 times your bet. The gold star can appear on any reel, and pays out according to the number of symbols: with three, you'll get a return equal to 300 times your bet, with four stars – 2,000 times your bet. Finally, with five symbols, you'll earn 10,000 times your bet! \n\nOverall, Fruity Crown is a great slot game that has both classic and innovative elements to it. With its stunning graphics, exciting special symbols, and substantial payouts, it's definitely worth checking out. So, take a spin and see if you can be crowned as the winner of this fruity kingdom!",

Let's start by talking about the graphics, which are very well done, as you would expect from a product by Playson. The symbols are well-defined and brightly colored, and the reels move on a black background while the pay lines are displayed on the sides of the frame. Below the grid, you'll find your total credit, your bet amount, and buttons to increase or decrease the value on each pay line. There's also a button to set the maximum bet in one go, a button for manual rotation, and one for starting auto spins. The game is accompanied by no sound effects, only the sound of the reels spinning.\n\nKey Features of the Slot Machine:\nFruity Crown's game grid has 5 reels and 4 rows, with 100 fixed pay lines – meaning you can't increase or decrease the number. The minimum bet is €0.20, while the maximum bet is €100. Winning combinations pay from left to right, and in case there are several winning combinations on the same line, only the highest will be paid out. The autoplay button allows you to start automatic spins, though you can't set a specific number. To return to manual mode, simply click the STOP button. The RTP is 95.2%, which is not great to be honest, while the volatility is average. There is no free spin system and the maximum payout is 1,056 times the bet.\n\nSymbols and Functions of Fruity Crown:\nThe regular symbols are all fruit-themed, including the number 7, as well as an expanding wild symbol and two scatters. The symbols that pay the least are the lemon, orange, plum, and cherries. If these appear three times, they pay out 10 times the bet, while five of them pay out 100 times the bet – still a considerable sum. The pear pays up to 400 times, and with watermelon and grapes you can reach up to 1,000 times your bet! The number 7 also pays out with just two symbols, but with five of them, you can earn 5,000 times your bet. Among the special symbols is the crown, which acts as a wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the scatters. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, and in a winning combination, it expands exponentially, increasing your chances of winning. Fruity Crown features two scatter symbols: Diamond and Gold. The diamond is represented by a blue star, and can only appear on reels 1, 3 or 5. Three of these will win you 2,000 times your bet. The gold star can appear on any reel, and pays out according to the number of symbols: with three, you'll get a return equal to 300 times your bet, with four stars – 2,000 times your bet. Finally, with five symbols, you'll earn 10,000 times your bet! \n\nOverall, Fruity Crown is a great slot game that has both classic and innovative elements to it. With its stunning graphics, exciting special symbols, and substantial payouts, it's definitely worth checking out. So, take a spin and see if you can be crowned as the winner of this fruity kingdom!\n            ",

Just like my grades in school. But unlike my grades, this RTP can work for you! It means if you bet $100 ten times, you can expect $95.2 back. </p><p>The volatility of the game is also nothing out of the ordinary. However, when it comes to the max payout, Fruity Crown does fall behind its competitors. The maximum payout is only 1,056 times your bet, which, well, isn't the poster child of high yields but hey, neither is your uncle's pension fund. </p><p> But before you call it quits, let's take a closer look! The regular fruit symbols pay out 10-100 times the bet, so there's still some game to be enjoyed here. And if you're lucky, the pear symbol will pay up to 400 times, the watermelon and grapes are worth up to 1,000 times the bet. But if you get the number 7 symbol, well, it's time to get a cabin in the woods as it pays out up to 5,000 times the bet- yee-haw! Oh, we mustn't forget the scatter symbol. The gold star provides the highest payout of them all. You could win up to 10,000 times the bet if you hit five symbols, which is incredibly generous and very much appreciated, just like a vegetarian potluck at a party full of carnivores!</p>"

The regular fruit symbols pay out 10-100 times the bet, so there's still some game to be enjoyed here. And if you're lucky, the pear symbol will pay up to 400 times, the watermelon and grapes are worth up to 1,000 times the bet.

Let's start by talking about the graphics, which are very well done, as you would expect from a product by Playson. The symbols are well-defined and brightly colored, and the reels move on a black background while the pay lines are displayed on the sides of the frame. Below the grid, you'll find your total credit, your bet amount, and buttons to increase or decrease the value on each pay line. There's also a button to set the maximum bet in one go, a button for manual rotation, and one for starting auto spins. The game is accompanied by no sound effects, only the sound of the reels spinning.\n\nKey Features of the Slot Machine:\nFruity Crown's game grid has 5 reels and 4 rows, with 100 fixed pay lines – meaning you can't increase or decrease the number. The minimum bet is €0.20, while the maximum bet is €100. Winning combinations pay from left to right, and in case there are several winning combinations on the same line, only the highest will be paid out. The autoplay button allows you to start automatic spins, though you can't set a specific number. To return to manual mode, simply click the STOP button. The RTP is 95.2%, which is not great to be honest, while the volatility is average. There is no free spin system and the maximum payout is 1,056 times the bet.\n\nSymbols and Functions of Fruity Crown:\nThe regular symbols are all fruit-themed, including the number 7, as well as an expanding wild symbol and two scatters. The symbols that pay the least are the lemon, orange, plum, and cherries. If these appear three times, they pay out 10 times the bet, while five of them pay out 100 times the bet – still a considerable sum. The pear pays up to 400 times, and with watermelon and grapes you can reach up to 1,000 times your bet! The number 7 also pays out with just two symbols, but with five of them, you can earn 5,000 times your bet. Among the special symbols is the crown, which acts as a wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the scatters. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, and in a winning combination, it expands exponentially, increasing your chances of winning. Fruity Crown features two scatter symbols: Diamond and Gold. The diamond is represented by a blue star, and can only appear on reels 1, 3 or 5. Three of these will win you 2,000 times your bet. The gold star can appear on any reel, and pays out according to the number of symbols: with three, you'll get a return equal to 300 times your bet, with four stars – 2,000 times your bet. Finally, with five symbols, you'll earn 10,000 times your bet! \n\nOverall, Fruity Crown is a great slot game that has both classic and innovative elements to it. With its stunning graphics, exciting special symbols, and substantial payouts, it's definitely worth checking out. So, take a spin and see if you can be crowned as the winner of this fruity kingdom!\n            ",

Let's start by talking about the graphics, which are very well done, as you would expect from a product by Playson. The symbols are well-defined and brightly colored, and the reels move on a black background while the pay lines are displayed on the sides of the frame. Below the grid, you'll find your total credit, your bet amount, and buttons to increase or decrease the value on each pay line. There's also a button to set the maximum bet in one go, a button for manual rotation, and one for starting auto spins. The game is accompanied by no sound effects, only the sound of the reels spinning.\n\nKey Features of the Slot Machine:\nFruity Crown's game grid has 5 reels and 4 rows, with 100 fixed pay lines – meaning you can't increase or decrease the number. The minimum bet is €0.20, while the maximum bet is €100. Winning combinations pay from left to right, and in case there are several winning combinations on the same line, only the highest will be paid out. The autoplay button allows you to start automatic spins, though you can't set a specific number. To return to manual mode, simply click the STOP button. The RTP is 95.2%, which is not great to be honest, while the volatility is average. There is no free spin system and the maximum payout is 1,056 times the bet.\n\nSymbols and Functions of Fruity Crown:\nThe regular symbols are all fruit-themed, including the number 7, as well as an expanding wild symbol and two scatters. The symbols that pay the least are the lemon, orange, plum, and cherries. If these appear three times, they pay out 10 times the bet, while five of them pay out 100 times the bet – still a considerable sum. The pear pays up to 400 times, and with watermelon and grapes you can reach up to 1,000 times your bet! The number 7 also pays out with just two symbols, but with five of them, you can earn 5,000 times your bet. Among the special symbols is the crown, which acts as a wild symbol and replaces all symbols except the scatters. It can only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4, and in a winning combination, it expands exponentially, increasing your chances of winning. Fruity Crown features two scatter symbols: Diamond and Gold. The diamond is represented by a blue star, and can only appear on reels 1, 3 or 5. Three of these will win you 2,000 times your bet. The gold star can appear on any reel, and pays out according to the number of symbols: with three, you'll get a return equal to 300 times your bet, with four stars – 2,000 times your bet. Finally, with five symbols, you'll earn 10,000 times your bet! \n\nOverall, Fruity Crown is a great slot game that has both classic and innovative elements to it. With its stunning graphics, exciting special symbols, and substantial payouts, it's definitely worth checking out. So, take a spin and see if you can be crowned as the winner of this fruity kingdom!\n            ",
